<html><body><div><h1>Victoria_and_Albert_Museum</h1><h2>The Victoria and Albert Museum (often abbreviated as the V&amp;A), London, is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design, housing a permanent collection of over 4.5 million objects. It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The V&amp;A is located in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area that has become known as &quot;Albertopolis&quot; because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Royal Albert Hall. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Like other national British museums, entrance to the museum has been free since 2001.</h2><h3>where is the Victoria and Albert Museum located?</h3><p>The V&amp;A is located in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</p><p>London</p><p>London</p><p>in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</p><h3>how many permanent objects are located there?</h3><p>a permanent collection of over 4.5 million objects.</p><p>over 4.5 million objects</p><p>over 4.5 million</p><p>4.5 million</p><h3>when was the Victoria and Albert museum founded?</h3><p>It was founded in 1852</p><p>1852</p><p>1852</p><p>1852</p><h3>Who is the museum named for?</h3><p>named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><h3>In which London borough is the Victoria and Albert Museum located?</h3><p>Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</p><p>Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</p><p>Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,</p><p>Royal</p><h3>In what year was the Victoria and Albert Museum founded?</h3><p>1852</p><p>1852</p><p>1852</p><p>1852</p><h3>Which monarchs was the Victoria and Albert Museum named after?</h3><p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</p><h3>Which department sponsors the Victoria and Albert Museum?</h3><p>Department for Culture, Media and Sport</p><p>Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p><p>the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p><p>the Department for Culture, Media and Sport</p><h3>In which year did the museum started charging free admission fees?</h3><p>2001</p><p>2001</p><p>2001</p><p>2001</p><h2>The V&amp;A covers 12.5 acres (51,000 m2) and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world. The museum owns the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance items being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world. Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world.</h2><h3>How many acres does the V&amp;A cover?</h3><p>12.5</p><p>12.5 acres</p><p>12.5 acres</p><p>12.5</p><h3>How many galleries does the V&amp;A have?</h3><p>145</p><p>145</p><p>145 galleries</p><p>145</p><h3>How many years does the V&amp;A's collections span?</h3><p>5,000</p><p>5,000</p><p>5,000 years</p><p>5,000</p><h3>Which cultures are represented in the V&amp;A's collections?</h3><p>Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa</p><p>Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa</p><p>Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa</p><p>Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa</p><h3>The V&amp;A owns the largest collection of which period in sculptural art history?</h3><p>post-classical sculpture</p><p>post-classical sculpture</p><p>post-classical sculpture</p><p>post-classical</p><h2>The V&amp;A has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851, with which Henry Cole, the museum's first director, was involved in planning; initially it was known as the Museum of Manufactures, first opening in May 1852 at Marlborough House, but by September had been transferred to Somerset House. At this stage the collections covered both applied art and science. Several of the exhibits from the Exhibition were purchased to form the nucleus of the collection. By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site and it was renamed South Kensington Museum. In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper, at the request of Cole, produced a design for the museum, but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive. The site was occupied by Brompton Park House; this was extended including the first refreshment rooms opened in 1857, the museum being the first in the world to provide such a facility.</h2><h3>The V&amp;A has its origins in which world exposition? </h3><p>Great Exhibition of 1851</p><p>Great Exhibition of 1851</p><p>Great Exhibition</p><h3>Who was the V&amp;A's first director?</h3><p>Henry Cole</p><p>Henry Cole,</p><p>Henry Cole</p><h3>What was the museum originally called?</h3><p>Museum of Manufactures</p><p>Museum of Manufactures</p><p>Museum of Manufactures</p><h3>Where was the V&amp;A transferred to from its original location at Marlborough House?</h3><p>Somerset House</p><p>Somerset House</p><p>Somerset House</p><h3>Which German architect was asked to produce a design for the museum?</h3><p>Gottfried Semper</p><p>Gottfried Semper</p><p>Gottfried Semper</p><h2>The official opening by Queen Victoria was on 22 June 1857. In the following year, late night openings were introduced, made possible by the use of gas lighting. This was to enable in the words of Cole &quot;to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes&quot;—this was linked to the use of the collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry. In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of &quot;High Art&quot; at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum. George Wallis (1811–1891), the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection, passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections. This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House; after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School, later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949. From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road. In 1893 the &quot;Science Museum&quot; had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed.</h2><h3>Who officially opened the V&amp;A?</h3><p>Queen Victoria</p><p>Queen Victoria</p><p>Queen Victoria</p><h3>What is the exact date of the V&amp;A's official opening?</h3><p>22 June 1857</p><p>22 June 1857</p><p>22 June 1857</p><h3>Who is known as the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection at the V&amp;A?</h3><p>George Wallis</p><p>George Wallis</p><p>George Wallis</p><h3>The use of gas lighting made what possible the year after the museum officially opened?</h3><p>late night openings</p><p>late night openings</p><p>late night openings</p><h3>In which year did the Royal College of Art gained full independence from the V&amp;A?</h3><p>1949</p><p>1949</p><p>1949</p><h2>Before the return of the collections after the war, the Britain Can Make It exhibition was held between September and November 1946, attracting nearly a million and a half visitors. This was organised by the Council of Industrial Design established by the British government in 1944 &quot;to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry&quot;. The success of this exhibition led to the planning of the Festival of Britain (1951). By 1948 most of the collections had been returned to the museum.</h2><h3>When was the Britain Can Make It exhibition held?</h3><p>between September and November 1946</p><p>between September and November 1946,</p><p>between September and November 1946</p><h3>How many visitors did the Britain Can Make It exhibition attract?</h3><p>nearly a million and a half</p><p>nearly a million and a half visitors</p><p>nearly a million and a half</p><h3>Who organized the Britain Can Make It exhibition?</h3><p>Festival of Britain (1951)</p><p>Council of Industrial Design</p><p>the Council of Industrial Design</p><h3>The success of the Britain Can Make It exhibition led to the planning of what exhibition in 1951?</h3><p>Festival of Britain</p><p>Festival of Britain</p><p>the Festival of Britain</p><h3>Most of the museum's collection had been returned by which year?</h3><p>1948</p><p>1948</p><p>1948</p><h2>In July 1973, as part of its outreach programme to young people, the V&amp;A became the first museum in Britain to present a rock concert. The V&amp;A presented a combined concert/lecture by British progressive folk-rock band Gryphon, who explored the lineage of mediaeval music and instrumentation and related how those contributed to contemporary music 500 years later. This innovative approach to bringing young people to museums was a hallmark of the directorship of Roy Strong and was subsequently emulated by some other British museums.</h2><h3>What did the V&amp;A present in July 1973 as part of its youth outreach programme?</h3><p>a rock concert</p><p>present a rock concert</p><p>a rock concert</p><h3>Which musical group did the V&amp;A present in July 1973 as part of its youth outreach programme?</h3><p>Gryphon</p><p>Gryphon</p><p>Gryphon</p><h3>The V&amp;A's youth outreach programme was a hallmark of whose directorship?</h3><p>Roy Strong</p><p>Roy Strong</p><p>Roy Strong</p><h3>Which musical genre did the progressive folk-rock band Gryphon presented at a concert/lecture at the V&amp;A? </h3><p>mediaeval music</p><p>explored the lineage of mediaeval music and instrumentation and related how those contributed to contemporary music 500 years later</p><p>mediaeval</p><h2>The V&amp;A is in discussion with the University of Dundee, University of Abertay, Dundee City Council and the Scottish Government with a view to opening a new £43 million gallery in Dundee that would use the V&amp;A brand although it would be funded through and operated independently. As of 2015, with costs estimated at £76 million, it is the most expensive gallery project ever undertaken in Scotland. The V&amp;A Dundee will be on the city's waterfront and is intended to focus on fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography. It is planned that it could open within five years. Dundee City Council is expected to pay a major part of the running costs. The V&amp;A is not contributing financially, but will be providing expertise, loans and exhibitions.</h2><h3>The V&amp;A is looking to open a branded gallery in which city in Scotland?</h3><p>Dundee</p><p>Dundee</p><p>Dundee</p><h3>What is the estimated cost of the V&amp;A branded gallery?</h3><p>£76 million</p><p>£76 million</p><p>£76 million</p><h3>Where in Dundee will the gallery be located?</h3><p>on the city's waterfront</p><p>on the city's waterfront</p><p>on the city's waterfront</p><h3>What will V&amp;A Dundee focus on?</h3><p>fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography</p><p>fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography</p><p>fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography</p><h3>When could V&amp;A Dundee?</h3><p>within five years</p><p>within five years</p><h2>The Victorian parts of the building have a complex history, with piecemeal additions by different architects. Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site. This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington. The land was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended, most notably by the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;, which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood. The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden. Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers, who was appointed by Cole. The next major expansions were designed by the same architect, the Turner and Vernon galleries built 1858-9 to house the eponymous collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively. The North and South Courts, were then built, both of which opened by June 1862. They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery. On the very northern edge of the site is situated the Secretariat Wing, also built in 1862 this houses the offices and board room etc. and is not open to the public.</h2><h3>What was the building that formerly occupied the V&amp;A's present site called?</h3><p>Brompton Park House</p><p>Brompton Park House</p><p>Brompton Park House</p><h3>What was the first building erected that still forms part of the museum?</h3><p>Sheepshanks Gallery</p><p>Sheepshanks Gallery</p><p>1857</p><h3>Who designed the Turner and Vernon galleries that were built in 1858-9?</h3><p>Captain Francis Fowke</p><p>Captain Francis Fowke</p><p>Captain Francis Fowke</p><h3>In which year were the North and South Courts opened?</h3><p>Secretariat Wing</p><p>June 1862</p><p>June 1862</p><h3>What does the Secretariat Wing house?</h3><p>offices and board room</p><p>houses the offices and board room etc. and is not open to the public</p><p>the offices and board room etc.</p><h2>An ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas: a series of mosaic figures depicting famous European artists of the Medieval and Renaissance period. These have now been removed to other areas of the museum. Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton: Industrial Arts as Applied to War 1878–1880 and Industrial Arts Applied to Peace, which was started but never finished. To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones, these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan) completed in 1863, none of this decoration survives, part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006. The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden, this includes the refreshment rooms, reinstated as the Museum Café in 2006, with the silver gallery above, (at the time the ceramics gallery), the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public. The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864–69. The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance, much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic, this north façade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting: Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); Titian (painting); thus representing the range of the museums collections, Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Façade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum, this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball. This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.</h2><h3>Who was the designer of the Oriental Courts?</h3><p>Oriental Courts</p><p>Owen Jones</p><p>Owen Jones</p><h3>What art historical style was used in the decoration for the northern part of the museum?</h3><p>Italian Renaissance</p><p>Italian Renaissance</p><p>Italian Renaissance</p><h3>Who designed the bronze doors used as the main entrance to the museum?</h3><p>James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe</p><p>James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe</p><p>James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe</p><h3>What famous English physicist and mathematician was depicted in the main bronze door entrance of the museum?</h3><p>Isaac Newton</p><p>Isaac Newton (astronomy</p><p>Isaac Newton</p><h3>What Italian painter was depicted in the main bronze door entrance of the museum?</h3><p>Titian</p><p>Michelangelo (sculpture)</p><p>Michelangelo</p><h2>The interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers. The Green Dining Room 1866–68 was the work of Philip Webb and William Morris, and displays Elizabethan influences. The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The Centre Refreshment Room 1865–77 was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble, the walls and even the Ionic columns are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929. The Grill Room 1876–81 was designed by Sir Edward Poynter, the lower part of the walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months these were painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum, the windows are also stained glass, there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.</h2><h3>Who were responsible for the interior decorations of the Green Dining Room?</h3><p>Philip Webb and William Morris</p><p>Philip Webb and William Morris</p><p>Philip Webb and William Morris</p><h3>Who designed the ceiling and stained-glass windows of the Green Dining Room?</h3><p>Edward Burne-Jones</p><p>Edward Burne-Jones</p><p>Edward Burne-Jones</p><h3>Who was responsible for the decorations of the Centre Refreshment Room?</h3><p>James Gamble</p><p>James Gamble,</p><p>James Gamble</p><h3>Who designed and sculpted the marble fireplace in the Centre Refreshment Room?</h3><p>Alfred Stevens</p><p>Alfred Stevens</p><p>Alfred Stevens</p><h3>Who was responsible for the decorations of the Grill Room?</h3><p>Sir Edward Poynter</p><p>Sir Edward Poynter</p><p>Sir Edward Poynter</p><h2>With the death of Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott, also of the Royal Engineers. He designed to the north west of the garden the five-storey School for Naval Architects (also known as the science schools), now the Henry Cole Wing in 1867–72. Scott's assistant J.W. Wild designed the impressive staircase that rises the full height of the building, made from Cadeby stone the steps are 7 feet (2.1 m) in length, the balustrades and columns are Portland stone. It is now used to jointly house the prints and architectural drawings of the V&amp;A (prints, drawings, paintings and photographs) and Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA Drawings and Archives Collections); and the Sackler Centre for arts education, which opened in 2008.</h2><h3>Who was brought it to work on the museum after the death of Captain Francis Fowke?</h3><p>Henry Young Darracott Scott</p><p>Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott,</p><p>Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott</p><h3>What was the Henry Cole Wing previously called?</h3><p>School for Naval Architects</p><p>the science schools</p><p>School for Naval Architects</p><h3>What stone was used for the staircase designed by J.W.

W. Moody, a final embellishment were the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner, these lead to a passage through the building. Scott also designed the two Cast Courts 1870–73 to the southeast of the garden (the site of the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;), these vast spaces have ceilings 70 feet (21 m) in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings, including Trajan's Column (in two separate pieces). The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden, built 1877–83, the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe who also designed the plaster work in the library, Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases, also this was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting. This completed the northern half of the site, creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre, but left the museum without a proper façade. In 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum, with architect Alfred Waterhouse as one of the judges; this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance.</h2><h3>What technique was used to decorate the east side of the building?</h3><p>sgraffito</p><p>sgraffito</p><p>sgraffito</p><h3>Who designed the wrought iron gates that was used to embellish the east side of the building?</h3><p>Starkie Gardner</p><p>Starkie Gardner</p><p>Starkie Gardner</p><h3>Where on the side are the two Cast Courts located?</h3><p>southeast of the garden</p><p>the southeast of the garden (the site of the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;),</p><p>southeast of the garden</p><h3>Where is the sculpture gallery now located?</h3><p>Art Library</p><p>the south side of the garden</p><p>south side of the garden</p><h3>Who designed the plaster work in the Art Library?</h3><p>Reuben Townroe</p><p>Reuben Townroe</p><p>Reuben Townroe</p><h2>The main façade, built from red brick and Portland stone, stretches 720 feet (220 m) along Cromwell Gardens and was designed by Aston Webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum. Construction took place between 1899 and 1909. Stylistically it is a strange hybrid, although much of the detail belongs to the Renaissance there are medieval influences at work. The main entrance consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by pier is Romanesque in form but Classical in detail. Likewise the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame, a feature of late Gothic architecture and a feature common in Scotland, but the detail is Classical. The main windows to the galleries are also mullioned and transomed, again a Gothic feature, the top row of windows are interspersed with statues of many of the British artists whose work is displayed in the museum.</h2><h3>Who designed the main façade that stretches along Cromwell Gardens?</h3><p>Aston Webb</p><p>Aston Webb</p><p>Aston Webb</p><h3>What building materials were used to build the main façade?</h3><p>red brick and Portland stone</p><p>red brick and Portland stone</p><p>red brick and Portland stone</p><h3>How long does the main façade stretch along Cromwell Gardens?</h3><p>720 feet</p><p>720 feet</p><p>720 feet</p><h3>What late Gothic architectural sculptural feature is found on the tower above the main entrance?</h3><p>a statue of fame</p><p>statue of fame</p><p>an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame</p><h3>Statues of British artists adorn which part of the tower above the main entrance?</h3><p>top row of windows</p><p>top row of windows</p><p>the top row of windows</p><h2>Prince Albert appears within the main arch above the twin entrances, Queen Victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance, sculpted by Alfred Drury. These façades surround four levels of galleries. Other areas designed by Webb include the Entrance Hall and Rotunda, the East and West Halls, the areas occupied by the shop and Asian Galleries as well as the Costume Gallery. The interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases, although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings, very much in contrast to the elaborate decoration of the Victorian galleries, although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century.</h2><h3>Who sculpted the representations of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria found in the main entrance?</h3><p>Alfred Drury</p><p>Alfred Drury.</p><p>Alfred Drury</p><h3>How many levels of galleries do the façades surround?</h3><p>four</p><p>four levels</p><p>four</p><h3>Who designed the Entrance Hall and Rotunda?</h3><p>Alfred Drury</p><p>Webb</p><p>Webb</p><h3>What building material does the entrance hall and flanking staircases use predominantly?</h3><p>marble</p><p>marble</p><p>marble</p><h3>Which British monarch appears above the frame around the arches and entrance?</h3><p>Queen Victoria</p><p>Prince Albert</p><p>Queen Victoria</p><h2>In the immediate post-war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600–1800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the façade.</h2><h3>Which part of the museum received the first major post-war work?</h3><p>Art Library</p><p>new storage space for books in the Art Library</p><p>new storage space for books in the Art Library</p><h3>What did the museum acquire from the Royal College of Science?</h3><p>Henry Cole wing</p><p>Henry Cole wing</p><p>Henry Cole wing</p><h3>What was constructed between 1978 and 1982 to link the Henry Cole wing to the rest of the museum?</h3><p>a new entrance building</p><p>new entrance building</p><p>a new entrance building</p><h3>Who designed the iron gates that decorate the new entrance building?</h3><p>Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne</p><p>Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne</p><p>Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne</p><h3>What was intended for the site of the former boiler house?</h3><p>the Spiral</p><p>the Spiral,</p><p>the Spiral</p><h2>A few galleries were redesigned in the 1990s including the Indian, Japanese, Chinese, iron work, the main glass galleries and the main silverware gallery which was further enhanced in 2002 when some of the Victorian decoration was recreated. This included two of the ten columns having their ceramic decoration replaced and the elaborate painted designs restored on the ceiling. As part of the 2006 renovation the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery were restored—most of the Victorian floors were covered in linoleum after the Second World War. After the success of the British Galleries, opened in 2001, it was decided to embark on a major redesign of all the galleries in the museum; this is known as &quot;FuturePlan&quot;, and was created in consultation with the exhibition designers and masterplanners Metaphor. The plan is expected to take about ten years and was started in 2002. To date several galleries have been redesigned, notably, in 2002: the main Silver Gallery, Contemporary; in 2003: Photography, the main entrance, The Painting Galleries; in 2004: the tunnel to the subway leading to South Kensington tube station, New signage throughout the museum, architecture, V&amp;A and RIBA reading rooms and stores, metalware, Members' Room, contemporary glass, the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery; in 2005: portrait miniatures, prints and drawings, displays in Room 117, the garden, sacred silver and stained glass; in 2006: Central Hall Shop, Islamic Middle East, the new café, sculpture galleries. Several designers and architects have been involved in this work. Eva Jiřičná designed the enhancements to the main entrance and rotunda, the new shop, the tunnel and the sculpture galleries.

The design is a subtle blend of the traditional and modern, the layout is formal; there is an elliptical water feature lined in stone with steps around the edge which may be drained to use the area for receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes. This is in front of the bronze doors leading to the refreshment rooms, a central path flanked by lawns leads to the sculpture gallery; the north, east and west sides have herbaceous borders along the museum walls with paths in front which continues along the south façade; in the two corners by the north façade there is planted an American Sweetgum tree; the southern, eastern and western edges of the lawns have glass planters which contain orange and lemon trees in summer, these are replaced by bay trees in winter.</h2><h3>Who redesigned the central garden?</h3><p>Kim Wilkie</p><p>Kim Wilkie</p><p>Kim Wilkie</p><h3>The redesigned central garden opened in 2005 with what new moniker?</h3><p>John Madejski Garden</p><p>the John Madejski Garden</p><p>John Madejski Garden</p><h3>What shape is the water feature in the John Madejski Garden?</h3><p>elliptical</p><p>elliptical</p><p>elliptical</p><h3>The steps around the water feature can be drained for what uses?</h3><p>receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes</p><p>receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes</p><p>receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes</p><h3>Which tree species is planted in the two corners by the north facade?</h3><p>American Sweetgum</p><p>orange and lemon trees</p><p>American Sweetgum</p><h2>In 2004, the V&amp;A alongside Royal Institute of British Architects opened the first permanent gallery in the UK covering the history of architecture with displays using models, photographs, elements from buildings and original drawings.

All of the archival material at the National Art Library is using Encoded Archival Description (EAD). The Victoria and Albert Museum has a computer system but most of the items in the collection, unless those were newly accessioned into the collection, probably do not show up in the computer system.

A large scale digitization project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitize the collection. The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a &quot;Search the Collections&quot; feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitization project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.</h2><h3>In which year did the V&amp;A's Word and Image Department began a large scale digitization project?</h3><p>2007</p><p>2007</p><p>2007</p><h3>What was the digitization project called?</h3><p>Factory Project</p><p>Factory Project</p><p>the Factory Project</p><h3>The title of the digitization project was a reference to which artist?</h3><p>Andy Warhol</p><p>Andy Warhol</p><p>Andy Warhol</p><h3>Approximately how many images were digitized during the first year of the digitization project?</h3><p>15,000</p><p>15,000</p><p>15,000</p><h3>What is the second phase of the digitization project?</h3><p>to catalog everything</p><p>catalog everything</p><p>to catalog everything</p><h2>Not only the work of British artists and craftspeople is on display, but also work produced by European artists that was purchased or commissioned by British patrons, as well as imports from Asia, including porcelain, cloth and wallpaper.

Patrons who have influenced taste are also represented by works of art from their collections, these include: Horace Walpole (a major influence on the Gothic Revival), William Thomas Beckford and Thomas Hope.</h2><h3>Who purchased or commissioned the works of European artists included the British galleries of the V&amp;A?</h3><p>British patrons</p><p>British patrons</p><p>British patrons</p><h3>Some non-British works in the British galleries were imported from which continent?</h3><p>Asia</p><p>Asia</p><p>Asia</p><h3>Which Italian that is credited with the creating the Baroque style of sculpture is represented in the V&amp;A's British galleries?</h3><p>Gian Lorenzo Bernini</p><p>Gian Lorenzo Bernini</p><p>Gian Lorenzo Bernini</p><h3>Which artist who had a major influence on the Gothic Revival is represented in the V&amp;A's British galleries?</h3><p>Horace Walpole</p><p>Horace Walpole</p><p>Horace Walpole</p><h3>What type of works from Asia are included in the V&amp;A's British galleries?</h3><p>porcelain, cloth and wallpaper</p><p>porcelain, cloth and wallpaper</p><p>porcelain, cloth and wallpaper</p><h2>The galleries also link design to wider trends in British culture. For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival. There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V&amp;A. In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialization, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.</h2><h3>What led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies during the Georgian period?</h3><p>increase in tea drinking</p><p>increase in tea drinking</p><p>increase in tea drinking</p><h3>What British cultural trend during the Georgian is linked to design during the same period?</h3><p>increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure</p><p>printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain</p><p>entertainment and leisure</p><h3>Who is considered the leading figure in the Arts and Crafts movement?</h3><p>John Ruskin</p><p>John Ruskin</p><p>John Ruskin</p><h3>The entrepreneurs Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade were influenced by what manufacturing process developed during the Industrial Revolution?</h3><p>the growth of mass production</p><p>the growth of mass production</p><p>mass production</p><h3>A reaction against industrialiazation contributed to the development of what artistic movement in the late 19th centurY</h3><p>Arts and Crafts</p><p>Gothic Revival</p><p>Arts and Crafts</p><h2>One of the most dramatic parts of the museum is the Cast Courts in the sculpture wing, comprising two large, skylighted rooms two storeys high housing hundreds of plaster casts of sculptures, friezes and tombs.

These galleries concentrate on works dated 1600 to 1950 by British sculptors, works by continental sculptors who worked in Britain, and works bought by British patrons from the continental sculptors, such as Canova's Theseus and the Minotaur. The galleries overlooking the garden are arranged by theme, tomb sculpture, portraiture, garden sculpture and mythology. Then there is a section that covers late 19th-century and early 20th-century sculpture, this includes work by Rodin and other French sculptors such as Dalou who spent several years in Britain where he taught sculpture.</h2><h3>Who were the sculpture galleries that opened in 2006 named after?</h3><p>Dorothy and Michael Hintze</p><p>Dorothy and Michael Hintze</p><p>Dorothy and Michael Hintze</p><h3>To which year does the new sculpture galleries now encompass?</h3><p>1950</p><p>1600 to 1950</p><p>1600 to 1950</p><h3>How are the galleries overlooking the garden arranged?</h3><p>by theme</p><p>by theme, tomb sculpture, portraiture, garden sculpture and mythology</p><p>by theme, tomb sculpture, portraiture, garden sculpture and mythology</p><h3>Which two British sculptors are now represented with the opening of the new galleries?</h3><p>Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein</p><p>Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein</p><p>Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein</p><h3>Which museum was among those that loaned more modern works for the new sculpture galleries?</h3><p>Tate Britain</p><p>Tate Britain</p><p>Tate Britain</p><h2>The collection of textiles consists of more than 53,000 examples, mainly western European though all populated continents are represented, dating from the 1st century AD to the present, this is the largest such collection in the world.

The conservators specialise in particular areas of conservation. Areas covered by conservator's work include &quot;preventive&quot; conservation this includes: performing surveys, assessments and providing advice on the handling of items, correct packaging, mounting and handling procedures during movement and display to reduce risk of damaging objects. Activities include controlling the museum environment (for example, temperature and light) and preventing pests (primarily insects) from damaging artefacts. The other major category is &quot;interventive&quot; conservation, this includes: cleaning and reintegration to strengthen fragile objects, reveal original surface decoration, and restore shape. Interventive treatment makes an object more stable, but also more attractive and comprehensible to the viewer. It is usually undertaken on items that are to go on public display.</h2><h3>Which area is responsible for the long-term preservation of the V&amp;A collections?</h3><p>Conservation</p><p>Conservation</p><p>Conservation</p><h3>What two environmental conditions are controlled in the museum?</h3><p>temperature and light</p><p>temperature and light</p><p>temperature and light</p><h3>What major category of conservation result in an object that is more attractive and more comprehensible to the viewer?</h3><p>interventive</p><p>interventive</p><p>interventive</p><h3>Besides the V&amp;A's, whose collections are under the responsibility of conservators at the V&amp;A?</h3><p>V&amp;A Museum of Childhood</p><p>V&amp;A Museum of Childhood</p><h3>What type of conservation include providing advice on the handling of items?</h3><p>preventive</p><p>preventive</p><p>preventive</p></div></body></html>
