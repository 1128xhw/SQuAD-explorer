<html><body><div><h1>Victoria_(Australia)</h1><h2>The economy of Victoria is highly diversified: service sectors including financial and property services, health, education, wholesale, retail, hospitality and manufacturing constitute the majority of employment. Victoria's total gross state product (GSP) is ranked second in Australia, although Victoria is ranked fourth in terms of GSP per capita because of its limited mining activity. Culturally, Melbourne is home to a number of museums, art galleries and theatres and is also described as the &quot;sporting capital of Australia&quot;. The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium in Australia, and the host of the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The ground is also considered the &quot;spiritual home&quot; of Australian cricket and Australian rules football, and hosts the grand final of the Australian Football League (AFL) each year, usually drawing crowds of over 95,000 people. Victoria includes eight public universities, with the oldest, the University of Melbourne, having been founded in 1853.</h2><h3>What kind of economy does Victoria have?</h3><p>diversified</p><p>highly diversified</p><p>highly diversified</p><h3>Where according to gross state product does Victoria rank in Australia?</h3><p>second</p><p>second</p><p>second</p><h3>At what rank does GPS per capita set Victoria?</h3><p>fourth</p><p>fourth</p><p>fourth</p><h3>What city in Victoria is called the sporting capital of Australia?</h3><p>Melbourne</p><p>Melbourne</p><p>Melbourne</p><h3>What is the largest stadium in Australia?</h3><p>Melbourne Cricket Ground</p><p>The Melbourne Cricket Ground</p><p>Melbourne Cricket Ground</p><h2>Immigrants arrived from all over the world to search for gold, especially from Ireland and China. Many Chinese miners worked in Victoria, and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs. Although there was some racism directed at them, there was not the level of anti-Chinese violence that was seen at the Lambing Flat riots in New South Wales. However, there was a riot at Buckland Valley near Bright in 1857. Conditions on the gold fields were cramped and unsanitary; an outbreak of typhoid at Buckland Valley in 1854 killed over 1,000 miners.</h2><h3>Where is the Asian influence strongest in Victoria?</h3><p>Bendigo</p><p>Bendigo</p><p>Bendigo</p><h3>Where were the Lambing Flat riots?</h3><p>New South Wales</p><p>New South Wales</p><p>New South Wales</p><h3>Where was the 1857 riot?</h3><p>Buckland Valley</p><p>Buckland Valley near Bright</p><p>Buckland Valley</p><h3>How many miners died in the typhoid outbreak of 1854?</h3><p>over 1,000</p><p>1,000</p><p>1,000</p><h3>What were the conditions for miners in the gold fields in Victoria?</h3><p>cramped and unsanitary</p><p>cramped and unsanitary</p><p>cramped and unsanitary</p><h2>In November 2006, the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system. The State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by Single Transferable Vote. The total number of upper house members was reduced from 44 to 40 and their term of office is now the same as the lower house members—four years. Elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years. Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected to eight-year terms from 22 two-member electorates.</h2><h3>What kind of representational system does the Victorian Legislative Council have?</h3><p>multi-member proportional</p><p>multi-member proportional</p><p>multi-member proportional representation system</p><h3>How many electorates does the State of Victoria have?</h3><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><h3>How many representatives does each electorate have?</h3><p>five</p><p>five</p><p>five</p><h3>What is the term of office for each house member?</h3><p>four years</p><p>four years</p><p>four years</p><h3>How often are elections held for the Victorian Parliament?</h3><p>every four years</p><p>every four years</p><p>four years</p><h2>The centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, the rural-based National Party of Australia, and the environmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria's main political parties. Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working class western and northern suburbs, and the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. The Liberals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres. The Nationals are strongest in Victoria's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas. The Greens, who won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne.</h2><h3>What political party is strongest in Melbourne's working class suburbs?</h3><p>Australian Labor Party</p><p>Australian Labor Party</p><p>Labor</p><h3>What party is strongest in Melbourne's affluent areas?</h3><p>Liberal Party</p><p>Liberal Party of Australia</p><p>Liberals</p><h3>Which party is strongest in Victoria's northwestern and eastern regions?</h3><p>National Party</p><p>National Party of Australia</p><p>Nationals</p><h3>What party rules in Melbourne's inner regions?</h3><p>The Greens</p><p>Australian Greens</p><p>Greens</p><h3>What party is favored in Bedigo and Geelong?</h3><p>Labor</p><p>Australian Labor Party</p><p>Labor</p><h2>About 61.1% of Victorians describe themselves as Christian.

Victoria is Australia's most densely populated state and its second-most populous state overall. Most of its population is concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay, which includes the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Melbourne, which is Australia's second-largest city. Geographically the smallest state on the Australian mainland, Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south,[note 1] New South Wales to the north, the Tasman Sea to the east, and South Australia to the west.</h2><h3>Where in Australia is Victoria located?</h3><p>south-east</p><p>south-east</p><p>the south-east of Australia</p><h3>How does Victoria rank as to population density?</h3><p>most densely populated</p><p>most</p><p>most densely populated state</p><h3>How populous is Victoria compared to other Australian states?</h3><p>second</p><p>second-most</p><p>second-most populous</p><h3>What city is the capital of Victoria?</h3><p>Melbourne</p><p>Melbourne</p><p>Melbourne</p><h3>Compared to other Australian cities, what is the size of Melbourne?</h3><p>second-largest</p><p>second-largest</p><p>second-largest city</p><h2>Prior to European settlement, the area now constituting Victoria was inhabited by a large number of Aboriginal peoples, collectively known as the Koori. With Great Britain having claimed the entire Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east in 1788, Victoria was included in the wider colony of New South Wales. The first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay, and much of what is now Victoria was included in the Port Phillip District in 1836, an administrative division of New South Wales. Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved self-government in 1855. The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the Federation of Australia in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia. Melbourne also served as capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927, with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne.</h2><h3>What is the term for the original Aboriginal people of Victoria?</h3><p>Koori</p><p>Koori</p><p>Koori</p><h3>When did Great Britain claim Australia? </h3><p>1788</p><p>1788</p><p>1788</p><h3>Where was Victoria first set to be located in Australia?</h3><p>New South Wales</p><p>New South Wales</p><p>New South Wales</p><h3>Where was the first settlement in Victoria?</h3><p>Sullivan Bay</p><p>Sullivan Bay</p><p>Sullivan Bay</p><h3>When was Victoria first settled?</h3><p>1803</p><p>1803</p><p>1803</p><h2>More than 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi) of Victorian farmland are sown for grain, mostly in the state's west. More than 50% of this area is sown for wheat, 33% for barley and 7% for oats. A further 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) is sown for hay. In 2003–04, Victorian farmers produced more than 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2 million tonnes of barley. Victorian farms produce nearly 90% of Australian pears and third of apples. It is also a leader in stone fruit production. The main vegetable crops include asparagus, broccoli, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. Last year, 121,200 tonnes of pears and 270,000 tonnes of tomatoes were produced.</h2><h3>How much Victorian farmland is farmed in grains?</h3><p>26,000 square kilometres</p><p>26,000 square kilometres</p><p>26,000 square kilometres</p><h3>What percentage of farmland grows wheat?</h3><p>50%</p><p>50%</p><p>50%</p><h3>How much of Victoria's farmland grows hay?</h3><p>6,000 square kilometres</p><p>6,000 square kilometres</p><p>6,000 square kilometres</p><h3>How much does Victoria produce in Australian pears?</h3><p>90%</p><p>90%</p><p>90%</p><h3>How many tonnes of tomatoes does Victoria produce?</h3><p>270,000</p><p>270,000</p><p>121,200</p><h2>Victoria has a written constitution enacted in 1975, but based on the 1855 colonial constitution, passed by the United Kingdom Parliament as the Victoria Constitution Act 1855, which establishes the Parliament as the state's law-making body for matters coming under state responsibility.

Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the Victoria Department of Education . Students do not pay tuition fees, but some extra costs are levied. Private fee-paying schools include parish schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and independent schools similar to British public schools. Independent schools are usually affiliated with Protestant churches. Victoria also has several private Jewish and Islamic primary and secondary schools. Private schools also receive some public funding. All schools must comply with government-set curriculum standards. In addition, Victoria has four government selective schools, Melbourne High School for boys, MacRobertson Girls' High School for girls, the coeducational schools John Monash Science School, Nossal High School and Suzanne Cory High School, and The Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School. Students at these schools are exclusively admitted on the basis of an academic selective entry test.</h2><h3>What are public schools in Victoria?</h3><p>state or government</p><p>state or government schools</p><p>state or government schools</p><h3>What organization runs the public schools in Victoria? </h3><p>Victoria Department of Education</p><p>the Victoria Department of Education</p><p>Victoria Department of Education</p><h3>Since students do not pay tuition, what do they have to pay for schooling in Victoria?</h3><p>some extra costs</p><p>some extra costs are levied</p><p>extra costs</p><h3>What church runs some private schools in Victoria?</h3><p>Roman Catholic Church</p><p>the Roman Catholic Church</p><p>Roman Catholic</p><h3>What government set standards do all schools have to meet?</h3><p>curriculum</p><p>curriculum standards</p><p>curriculum</p><h2>Historically, Victoria has been the base for the manufacturing plants of the major car brands Ford, Toyota and Holden; however, closure announcements by all three companies in the 21st century will mean that Australia will no longer be a base for the global car industry, with Toyota's statement in February 2014 outlining a closure year of 2017.

This triggered one of the largest gold rushes the world has ever seen. The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power. In ten years the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced including the &quot;richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world&quot; and the largest gold nugget.
