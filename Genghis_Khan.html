<html><body><div><h1>Genghis_Khan</h1><h2>He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;, he started the Mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of Eurasia. These included raids or invasions of the Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations – especially in the Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.</h2><h3>What do we call the empire that Genghis Khan founded?</h3><p>the Mongol Empire</p><p>Mongol Empire</p><p>Mongol Empire</p><h3>Who did Genghis Khan unite before he began conquering the rest of Eurasia?</h3><p>many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia</p><p>nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia</p><p>many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia.</p><h3>In which regions in particular did Genghis Khan's armies massacre civilians?</h3><p>Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands</p><p>Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands</p><p>Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties</p><h3>What areas did Genghis Khan control at the end of his life?</h3><p>a substantial portion of Central Asia and China</p><p>substantial portion of Central Asia and China</p><p>a substantial portion of Central Asia and China</p><h3>Which other empires or dynasties did Genghis Khan conquer?</h3><p>the Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties</p><p>Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin</p><p>Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands</p><h2>Before Genghis Khan died, he assigned Ögedei Khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons. He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia. He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location. His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states out of all of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe, Russia, and Southwest Asia. Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations. As a result, Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories.</h2><h3>Who did Genghis Khan assign as his successor?</h3><p>Ögedei Khan</p><p>Ögedei Khan</p><p>Ögedei Khan</p><h3>What year did Genghis Khan die?</h3><p>1227</p><p>1227</p><p>1227</p><h3>Which empire was the last one Genghis Khan conquered before he died?</h3><p>Western Xia</p><p>Western Xia</p><p>Western Xia</p><h3>Among whom was Genghis Khan's empire split after his death?</h3><p>his sons and grandsons</p><p>sons and grandsons</p><p>his sons and grandsons.</p><h3>Where was Genghis Khan buried?</h3><p>somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location</p><p>Mongolia</p><p>unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia</p><h2>Temüjin was probably born in 1162 in Delüün Boldog, near Burkhan Khaldun mountain and the Onon and Kherlen rivers in modern-day northern Mongolia, not far from the current capital Ulaanbaatar. The Secret History of the Mongols reports that Temüjin was born with a blood clot grasped in his fist, a traditional sign that he was destined to become a great leader. He was the second-oldest son of his father Yesügei, a Khamag Mongol's major chief of the Kiyad and an ally of Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe, and the oldest son of his mother Hoelun. According to the Secret History, Temüjin was named after a Tatar chieftain, Temüjin-üge, whom his father had just captured.</h2><h3>Where was Genghis Khan likely born?</h3><p>Delüün Boldog</p><p>Delüün Boldog</p><p>Delüün Boldog,</p><h3>Who was Genghis Khan's father?</h3><p>Yesügei, a Khamag Mongol's major chief of the Kiyad</p><p>Yesügei</p><p>Yesügei</p><h3>What year was Temüjin, who became Genghis Khan, likely born?</h3><p>1162</p><p>1162</p><p>1162</p><h3>Who might Temüjin have been named after?</h3><p>a Tatar chieftain, Temüjin-üge, whom his father had just captured</p><p>Temüjin-üge</p><p>Tatar chieftain, Temüjin-üge</p><h2>Temüjin had three brothers named Hasar, Hachiun, and Temüge, and one sister named Temülen, as well as two half-brothers named Begter and Belgutei. Like many of the nomads of Mongolia, Temüjin's early life was difficult. His father arranged a marriage for him, and at nine years of age he was delivered by his father to the family of his future wife Börte, who was a member of the tribe Khongirad. Temüjin was to live there in service to Dai Setsen, the head of the new household, until he reached the marriageable age of 12.</h2><h3>What was Temüjin' sister's name?</h3><p>Temülen</p><p>Temülen</p><p>Temülen</p><h3>Who were Temüjin's three full brothers?</h3><p>Hasar, Hachiun, and Temüge</p><p>Hasar, Hachiun, and Temüge</p><p>Hasar, Hachiun, and Temüge</p><h3>What was the name of the wife arranged for Temüjin by his father?</h3><p>Börte</p><p>Börte</p><p>Börte</p><h3>Which tribe did Temüjin move in with at nine years of age?</h3><p>Khongirad</p><p>Khongirad</p><p>Khongirad</p><h3>Who was the head of the household that Temüjin joined when he was nine years old?</h3><p>Dai Setsen</p><p>Dai Setsen</p><p>Dai Setsen</p><h2>For the next several years, Hoelun and her children lived in poverty, surviving primarily on wild fruits and ox carcasses, marmots, and other small game killed by Temüjin and his brothers. Begter, Temujin's older half-brother, began to exercise the power of the eldest male in the family and eventually Temujin's mother Hoelun (not Begter's mother) would have to accept him as her husband if and when he became an adult. Temujin's resentment erupted during one hunting excursion that Temüjin and his brother Khasar killed their half-brother Begter.</h2><h3>Which of Temüjin's brothers took up the role of male leader of the family?</h3><p>Begter</p><p>Begter</p><p>Begter</p><h3>Who would Begter have married when he came of age?</h3><p>Hoelun</p><p>Hoelun</p><p>Temujin's mother</p><h3>Who killed Begter, Temüjin's half-brother?</h3><p>Temüjin and his brother Khasar</p><p>Temüjin and his brother Khasar</p><p>Temüjin and his brother Khasar</p><h3>When was Temüjin's half-brother Begter killed?</h3><p>during one hunting excursion</p><p>one hunting excursion</p><p>during one hunting excursion</p><h2>In another incident, around 1177, he was captured in a raid and held prisoner by his father's former allies, the Tayichi'ud. The Tayichi'ud enslaved Temüjin (reportedly with a cangue, a sort of portable stocks), but with the help of a sympathetic guard, the father of Chilaun (who later became a general of Genghis Khan), he was able to escape from the ger (yurt) in the middle of the night by hiding in a river crevice.[citation needed] It was around this time that Jelme and Bo'orchu, two of Genghis Khan's future generals, joined forces with him. Temüjin's reputation also became widespread after his escape from the Tayichi'ud.</h2><h3>Who captured and held Temüjin prisoner around 1177?</h3><p>the Tayichi'ud</p><p>Tayichi'ud</p><p>his father's former allies, the Tayichi'ud</p><h3>How was Temüjin kept imprisoned by the Tayichi'ud?</h3><p>with a cangue, a sort of portable stocks</p><p>cangue</p><p>cangue, a sort of portable stocks</p><h3>Which of his future general's fathers helped Temüjin escape the Tayichi'ud?</h3><p>Chilaun</p><p>Chilaun</p><p>the father of Chilaun</p><h3>Which of his future generals joined forces with Temüjin around the time of his escape from the Tayichi'ud?</h3><p>Jelme and Bo'orchu</p><p>Jelme and Bo'orchu</p><p>Jelme and Bo'orchu</p><h3>Where did Temüjin hide during his escape from the Tayichi'ud?</h3><p>a river crevice</p><p>a river crevice</p><p>a river crevice.</p><h2>At this time, none of the tribal confederations of Mongolia were united politically, and arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances. Temüjin grew up observing the tough political climate of Mongolia, which included tribal warfare, thievery, raids, corruption, and continual acts of revenge carried out between the various confederations, all compounded by interference from foreign forces such as the Chinese dynasties to the south. Temüjin's mother Hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of Mongolia, especially the need for alliances.</h2><h3>What was used to from political alliances among the Mongolian tribal confederations?</h3><p>arranged marriages</p><p>arranged marriages</p><p>arranged marriages</p><h3>Who taught Temüjin early lessons about politics in Mongolia?</h3><p>Temüjin's mother Hoelun</p><p>Hoelun</p><p>Temüjin's mother Hoelun</p><h3>Which foreign forces often meddled in the Mongolian political scene?</h3><p>the Chinese dynasties to the south</p><p>Chinese dynasties</p><p>Chinese dynasties to the south</p><h3>What did Temüjin's mother emphasize in his lessons about Mongolia's volatile political climate?</h3><p>the need for alliances</p><p>need for alliances</p><p>need for alliances.</p><h2>As previously arranged by his father, Temüjin married Börte of the Onggirat tribe when he was around 16 in order to cement alliances between their respective tribes. Soon after Börte's marriage to Temüjin, she was kidnapped by the Merkits and reportedly given away as a wife. Temüjin rescued her with the help of his friend and future rival, Jamukha, and his protector, Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe. She gave birth to a son, Jochi (1185–1226), nine months later, clouding the issue of his parentage. Despite speculation over Jochi, Börte would be Temüjin's only empress, though he did follow tradition by taking several morganatic wives.</h2><h3>What was the tribe of the woman Temüjin married when he was around 16 years old?</h3><p>the Onggirat</p><p>Onggirat</p><p>Onggirat tribe</p><h3>Who kidnapped Temüjin's first wife soon after they were married?</h3><p>the Merkits</p><p>Merkits</p><p>the Merkits</p><h3>Who helped Temüjin rescue his wife from the Merkits?</h3><p>Jamukha, and his protector, Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe</p><p>Jamukha, and his protector, Toghrul Khan</p><p>Jamukha, and his protector, Toghrul Khan</p><h3>What was the name of Temüjin's wife Börte's first son?</h3><p>Jochi</p><p>Jochi</p><p>Jochi</p><h3>What year did Börte's give birth to Jochi?</h3><p>1185</p><p>1185</p><p>(1185</p><h2>Börte had three more sons, Chagatai (1187—1241), Ögedei (1189—1241), and Tolui (1190–1232). Genghis Khan also had many other children with his other wives, but they were excluded from the succession. While the names of sons were documented, daughters were not. The names of at least six daughters are known, and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime, no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of Genghis Khan.</h2><h3>How many sons did Börte bear Genghis Khan after Jochi?</h3><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><h3>What was the name of Börte's second male child?</h3><p>Chagatai</p><p>Chagatai</p><p>Ögedei</p><h3>What year did two of Ghengis Khan and Börte's sons die?</h3><p>1241</p><p>1241</p><p>1241</p><h3>Which male child of Ghengis Khan and Börte was born last?</h3><p>Tolui</p><p>Tolui</p><p>Tolui</p><h3>How many names of Ghengis Khan's daughters are known?</h3><p>six</p><p>six</p><p>six</p><h2>Temüjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally (or, according to other sources, a vassal) to his father's anda (sworn brother or blood brother) Toghrul, who was Khan of the Keraites, and is better known by the Chinese title &quot;Wang Khan&quot;, which the Jurchen Jin dynasty granted him in 1197. This relationship was first reinforced when Börte was captured by the Merkits. Temüjin turned to Toghrul for support, and in response, Toghrul offered his vassal 20,000 of his Keraite warriors and suggested that he also involve his childhood friend Jamukha, who had himself become Khan (ruler) of his own tribe, the Jadaran.</h2><h3>What is an anda?</h3><p>sworn brother or blood brother</p><p>sworn brother</p><p>sworn brother or blood brother)</p><h3>With whom was Temüjin's first important alliance?</h3><p>Toghrul</p><p>Toghrul</p><p>Toghrul</p><h3>What tribe did Toghrul lead?</h3><p>the Keraites</p><p>Keraites</p><p>Keraites</p><h3>How many warriors did Toghrul provide Temüjin when his wife was captured?</h3><p>20,000</p><p>20,000</p><p>20,000</p><h3>Which of Temüjin's childhood friends did Toghrul suggest he also enlist?</h3><p>Jamukha</p><p>Jamukha</p><p>Jamukha</p><h2>As Jamukha and Temüjin drifted apart in their friendship, each began consolidating power, and soon became rivals. Jamukha supported the traditional Mongolian aristocracy, while Temüjin followed a meritocratic method, and attracted a broader, though lower class, range of followers. Due to his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power. In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the Mongols. However, Jamukha, threatened by Temüjin's rapid ascent, quickly moved to stop Temüjin's ambitions. In 1187, he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops. Temüjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack, but he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut. Jamukha horrified people greatly and harmed his image by boiling seventy young male captives alive in cauldrons, alienating many of his potential followers and eliciting sympathy for Temüjin. Toghrul, as Temüjin's patron, was exiled to the Qara Khitai. The life of Temüjin for the next ten years is very unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.</h2><h3>Who did Jamukha support that were not part of Temüjin's power base?</h3><p>the traditional Mongolian aristocracy</p><p>traditional Mongolian aristocracy</p><p>the traditional Mongolian aristocracy</p><h3>Which shaman's proclamation aided Temüjin's rise? </h3><p>Kokochu</p><p>Kokochu</p><p>Kokochu</p><h3>When was Temüjin elected khan of the Mongols?</h3><p>1186</p><p>1186</p><p>1186</p><h3>Which battle did Temüjin lose to Jamukha shortly after his election as khan?</h3><p>Battle of Dalan Balzhut</p><p>Battle of Dalan Balzhut</p><p>1187</p><h3>Where was Temüjin's patron Toghrul exiled?</h3><p>Qara Khitai</p><p>Qara Khitai</p><p>Qara Khitai.</p><h2>As an incentive for absolute obedience and following his rule of law, the Yassa code, Temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils. As he defeated rival tribes, he did not drive away enemy soldiers and abandon the rest. Instead, he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe. He would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe, bringing them into his family. These political innovations inspired great loyalty among the conquered people, making Temüjin stronger with each victory.</h2><h3>What was the name of Temüjin's laws?</h3><p>the Yassa code</p><p>Yassa code</p><p>Yassa code</p><h3>What did Temüjin promise his followers in exchange for their obedience?</h3><p>wealth from future possible war spoils</p><p>wealth</p><p>wealth</p><h3>Who did Temüjin's mother adopt to help integrate the tribes he conquered?</h3><p>orphans from the conquered tribe</p><p>orphans</p><p>orphans from the conquered tribe</p><h3>What did Temüjin offer the people he conquered in order earn their loyalty?</h3><p>his protection</p><p>political innovations</p><p>protection and integrated its members into his own tribe.</p><h2>One of the later ruptures between Toghrul and Temüjin was Toghrul's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to Jochi, the eldest son of Temüjin, a sign of disrespect in the Mongolian culture. This act led to the split between both factions and was a prelude to war. Toghrul allied himself with Jamukha, who already opposed Temüjin's forces; however, the internal dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Temüjin, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the Keraite tribe.</h2><h3>To whom did Toghrul refuse to give his daughter in marriage, angering Temüjin?</h3><p>Jochi</p><p>Jochi</p><p>Jochi,</p><h3>Who did Toghrul join in a campaign against Temüjin?</h3><p>Jamukha</p><p>Jamukha</p><p>Jamukha,</p><h3>Who escaped when Temüjin emerged victorious in his conflict with Toghrul?</h3><p>Jamukha</p><p>Jamukha</p><p>Jamukha</p><h3>What tribe fell apart after Temüjin defeated Toghrul?</h3><p>the Keraite</p><p>Keraite</p><p>Keraite tribe</p><h2>The next direct threat to Temüjin was the Naimans (Naiman Mongols), with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge. The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Temüjin. In 1201, a khuruldai elected Jamukha as Gür Khan, &quot;universal ruler&quot;, a title used by the rulers of the Qara Khitai. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Temüjin, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, however, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including Subutai, Jelme's well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was finally turned over to Temüjin by his own men in 1206.</h2><h3>Who protected Jamukha after he escaped the conflict with Temüjin?</h3><p>the Naimans</p><p>Naimans</p><p>the Naimans</p><h3>What year was Jamukha elected Gür Khan?</h3><p>1201</p><p>1201</p><p>1201</p><h3>What does the title Gür Khan mean?</h3><p>universal ruler</p><p>universal ruler</p><p>universal ruler</p><h3>Which well-known general abandoned Jamukha's coalition against Temüjin?</h3><p>Subutai</p><p>Subutai</p><p>Subutai</p><h3>What year was Jamukha surrendered to Temüjin?</h3><p>1206</p><p>1206</p><p>1206</p><h2>According to the Secret History, Temüjin again offered his friendship to Jamukha, asking him to return to his side. Temüjin had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer of friendship and reunion, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom is to die without spilling blood, which is granted by breaking the back. Jamukha requested this form of death, despite the fact that in the past Jamukha had been known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.</h2><h3>What did Temüjin offer Jamukha after the latter's defeat?</h3><p>his friendship</p><p>friendship</p><p>friendship</p><h3>Why did Temüjin kill those of Jamukha's followers that had betrayed their leader?</h3><p>he did not want disloyal men in his army</p><p>did not want disloyal men in his army</p><p>he did not want disloyal men in his army</p><h3>What did Jamukha request from Temüjin instead of friendship?</h3><p>a noble death</p><p>a noble death</p><p>a noble death.</p><h3>What form of death did Jamukha hope Temüjin would allow him? </h3><p>breaking the back</p><p>breaking the back</p><p>breaking the back</p><h2>Accounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son Jochi, and problems with the most important shaman, who was allegedly trying to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother Khasar. His military strategies showed a deep interest in gathering good intelligence and understanding the motivations of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and Yam route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as siege warfare from the Chinese. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of measuring against the linchpin, used against the tribes led by Jamukha.</h2><h3>From whom did Genghis Khan learn seige warfare?</h3><p>the Chinese</p><p>Chinese</p><p>the Chinese</p><h3>Which rival's tribes did Genghis Khan famously measure against the linchpin?</h3><p>Jamukha</p><p>Jamukha</p><p>tribes led by Jamukha</p><h3>An important shaman was alleged to be trying to distance Genghis Khan from which of his brothers?</h3><p>Khasar</p><p>Khasar</p><p>Khasar</p><h3>What aspect of the economy did Genghis Khan exploit for intelligence gathering?</h3><p>Yam route systems</p><p>understanding the motivations of his rivals</p><h3>Who was the ally of his father that Genghis Khan fell out as time passed?</h3><p>Wang Khan</p><p>Wang Khan</p><p>Wang Khan</p><h2>As a result, by 1206 Temüjin had managed to unite or subdue the Merkits, Naimans, Mongols, Keraites, Tatars, Uyghurs, and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. It was a monumental feat for the &quot;Mongols&quot; (as they became known collectively). At a Khuruldai, a council of Mongol chiefs, Temüjin was acknowledged as &quot;Khan&quot; of the consolidated tribes and took the new title &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;. The title Khagan was not conferred on Genghis until after his death, when his son and successor, Ögedei, took the title for himself and extended it posthumously to his father (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the Yuan dynasty). This unification of all confederations by Genghis Khan established peace between previously warring tribes and a single political and military force under Genghis Khan.</h2><h3>By what year had Temüjin created a significant &quot;Mongol&quot; tribal alliance?</h3><p>1206</p><p>1206</p><p>1206</p><h3>What is the term for a meeting of Mongol chiefs?</h3><p>Khuruldai</p><p>Khuruldai</p><p>Khuruldai</p><h3>What title was given to Genghis Khan posthumously?</h3><p>Khagan</p><p>Khagan</p><p>Khagan</p><h3>Who gave Genghis Khan the title Khadan?</h3><p>Ögedei</p><p>Ögedei</p><p>Ögedei</p><h3>Who made Temüjin khan of the Mongols?</h3><p>a council of Mongol chiefs</p><p>a council of Mongol chiefs</p><p>a council of Mongol chiefs</p><h2>In 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the Jin dynasty. The commander of the Jin dynasty army made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, Ming-Tan, to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At this engagement fought at Badger Pass the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. In 1215 Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing). This forced the Emperor Xuanzong to move his capital south to Kaifeng, abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, Kaifeng fell to the Mongols under the reign of Genghis' third son, Ögedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the siege of Caizhou.</h2><h3>What dynasty did Genghis Khan plan to attack after conquering Western Xia?</h3><p>the Jin dynasty</p><p>Jin dynasty.</p><p>Jin dynasty</p><h3>Who was the Jin dynasty defector who betrayed the location of the Jin army?</h3><p>Ming-Tan</p><p>Ming-Tan</p><p>Ming-Tan</p><h3>When did Genghis Khan capture the Jin dynasty capital?</h3><p>1215</p><p>1215</p><p>1215</p><h3>Where did the Jin emporer relocate his capital after Genghis Khan overran the norther part of his empire?</h3><p>Kaifeng</p><p>Kaifeng</p><p>Kaifeng,</p><h3>Which of Genghis Khan's sons completed the conquest of the Jin dynasty?</h3><p>Ögedei Khan</p><p>Ögedei Khan</p><p>Ögedei Khan</p><h2>Kuchlug, the deposed Khan of the Naiman confederation that Temüjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the khanate of Qara Khitai (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the Liao dynasty). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two tumen (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, Jebe, known as &quot;The Arrow&quot;.</h2><h3>Who took control of Qara Khitai after fleeing Temüjin's Mongol Empire?</h3><p>Kuchlug</p><p>Kuchlug</p><p>Kuchlug</p><h3>What older dynasty was replaced by the Western Liao, or Qara Khitai?</h3><p>the Liao dynasty</p><p>Liao</p><p>Liao dynasty</p><h3>How many soldiers did Genghis Khan send against Kuchlug and Qara Khitai?</h3><p>20,000</p><p>20,000</p><p>20,000</p><h3>Which young general did Genghis Khan send to conquer Qara Khitai?</h3><p>Jebe</p><p>Jebe</p><p>Jebe</p><h3>What other moniker was Genghis Khan's general Jebe known by?</h3><p>The Arrow</p><p>The Arrow</p><p>The Arrow</p><h2>With such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of Kashgar. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as Lake Balkhash, which bordered the Khwarezmia (Khwarezmid Empire), a Muslim state that reached the Caspian Sea to the west and Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea to the south.</h2><h3>What strategy did Jebe's army use against Kuchlug and his supporters?</h3><p>inciting internal revolt</p><p>inciting internal revolt</p><p>inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters</p><h3>Where did Jebe's forces first defeat Kuchlug?</h3><p>west of Kashgar</p><p>west of Kashgar</p><p>west of Kashgar</p><h3>How far west did the Mongol Empire extend after Kuchlug's demise?</h3><p>Lake Balkhash</p><p>Lake Balkhash</p><p>Lake Balkhash,</p><h3>Which empire bordered the Mongol Empire to the west in 1218?</h3><p>Khwarezmid Empire</p><p>Khwarezmid</p><p>Khwarezmid Empire</p><h3>What kind of state was the Khwarezmia?</h3><p>a Muslim state</p><p>Muslim</p><p>Muslim</p><h2>In the early 13th century, the Khwarazmian dynasty was governed by Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed Ögedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.</h2><h3>Who was the leader of the Khwarezmian dynasty in the early 1200s?</h3><p>Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad</p><p>Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad</p><p>Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad</p><h3>Who ordered the attack on the caravan of traders Genghis Khan send to Khwarezmia?</h3><p>Inalchuq</p><p>Inalchuq</p><p>Inalchuq</p><h3>Which of Genghis Khan's ambassadors did the Shah have beheaded?</h3><p>the Muslim</p><p>Muslim</p><p>the Muslim</p><h3>How many soldiers did Genghis Khan take with him to Khwarezmia?</h3><p>100,000</p><p>100,000</p><p>100,000 soldiers</p><h3>What trading route joined Khwarezmia and the Mongol Empire?</h3><p>the Silk Road</p><p>Silk Road</p><p>Silk Road</p><h2>The Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the Tien Shan mountains by entering the area controlled by the Khwarezmian Empire. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son Jochi led the first division into the northeast of Khwarezmia. The second division under Jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarzemia to form, with the first division, a pincer attack on Samarkand. The third division under Genghis Khan and Tolui marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarzemia from that direction.</h2><h3>What mountain range did Genghis Khan cross to enter the Khwarezmian Empire?</h3><p>Tien Shan</p><p>Tien Shan</p><p>Tien Shan</p><h3>How many divisions comprised Genghis Khan's army in Khwarezmia?</h3><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three groups</p><h3>Where did Jebe's division of Genghis Khan's army campaign in Khwarezmia?</h3><p>the southeast</p><p>southeast</p><p>the southeast part of Khwarzemia</p><h3>Who led the third division in Khwarezmia alongside Genghis Khan himself?</h3><p>Tolui</p><p>Tolui</p><p>Genghis Khan and Tolui</p><h3>Which area of Khwarezmia did the first and second divisions of the Mongol army target in a pincer attack?</h3><p>Samarkand</p><p>Samarkand</p><p>Samarkand</p><h2>The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered Subutai and Jebe to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.</h2><h3>What feature of the Shah's army enable the weary Mongol forces easy early victories?</h3><p>fragmentation</p><p>fragmentation</p><p>fragmentation</p><h3>Which town's massacre did Genghis Khan order in retribution for the treatment of his envoys?</h3><p>Otrar</p><p>Otrar</p><p>Otrar</p><h3>What metal was used in Inalchuq's execution?</h3><p>silver</p><p>silver</p><p>molten silver</p><h3>What did the Shah do when faced with defeat by Genghis Khan's forces?</h3><p>fled</p><p>fled</p><p>fled</p><h3>Who did Genghis Khan charge with finding and punishing the Shah?</h3><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><h2>The Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital Samarkand fell, the capital was moved to Bukhara by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarezmid Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland. According to legend, Genghis Khan even went so far as to divert a river through the Khwarezmid emperor's birthplace, erasing it from the map.[citation needed]</h2><h3>What was the capital of Khwarezmia before the Mongol invasion?</h3><p>Samarkand</p><p>Samarkand</p><p>Samarkand</p><h3>Where was the Khwarezmid capital moved after Genghis Khan's forces prevailed in Samarkand?</h3><p>Bukhara</p><p>Bukhara</p><p>Bukhara</p><h3>What does legend say Genghis Khan used to obliterate the Kharezmid emporer's place of birth?</h3><p>a river</p><p>a river</p><p>a river</p><h2>The Mongols attacked Samarkand using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the Shah, held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory. Ata-Malik Juvayni, a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in Termez, on the Oxus, &quot;all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain&quot;.</h2><h3>What did the Mongols shield themselves with while attacking Samarkand?</h3><p>captured enemies</p><p>captured enemies</p><p>captured enemies</p><h3>How did Genghis Khan observed the surrender terms after Samarkand fell?</h3><p>reneged</p><p>reneged</p><p>executed every soldier</p><h3>What victory symbols did the Mongols build on the plains outside Samarkand?</h3><p>pyramids of severed heads</p><p>pyramids of severed heads</p><p>pyramids of severed heads</p><h2>The city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarezmi cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery. As the Mongol soldiers looted the city, a fire broke out, razing most of the city to the ground. Genghis Khan had the city's surviving population assemble in the main mosque of the town, where he declared that he was the flail of God, sent to punish them for their sins.</h2><h3>How did the leaders of the city of Bukhara respond to the Mongol attack?</h3><p>opened the gates</p><p>opened the gates to the Mongols</p><p>opened the gates to the Mongols</p><h3>Who continued to hold the citadel of Bukhara after the Mongols took the rest of the city?</h3><p>a unit of Turkish defenders</p><p>a unit of Turkish defenders</p><p>Turkish defenders</p><h3>Which residents of Bukhara were spared and sent back to Mongolia?</h3><p>artisans and craftsmen</p><p>artisans and craftsmen</p><p>artisans and craftsmen</p><h3>How did Genghis Khan describe himself to the people of Bukhara?</h3><p>the flail of God</p><p>the flail of God</p><p>the flail of God,</p><h3>Who among the population of Bukhara became part of the Mongolian army?</h3><p>young men who had not fought</p><p>young men who had not fought</p><p>young men who had not fought</p><h2>After the defeat of the Khwarezmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in Persia and Armenia to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including Mstislav III of Kiev, were put under this platform and crushed to death.</h2><h3>What year did the Khwarezmian Empire fall to Genghis Khan?</h3><p>1220</p><p>1220</p><p>1220,</p><h3>Whose plan called for the Mongolian army to split in two after the Khwarezmian conquest?</h3><p>Subutai</p><p>Subutai</p><p>Subutai</p><h3>Where did Jebe and Subutai spend the winter following the split of the Mongol army?</h3><p>near the Black Sea</p><p>Black Sea</p><p>Russia</p><h3>Where was the Kievian force that confronted Subutai's army defeated in 1223?</h3><p>Kalka River</p><p>Kalka River</p><p>Kalka River</p><h3>Who led the Kievian Rus' troops against Subutai's Mongol army?</h3><p>Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev</p><p>Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev</p><p>Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev</p><h2>The Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for conquest of Hungary and Europe. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added Transoxiana and Persia to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson Batu and the Golden Horde, the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.</h2><h3>Which Mongol leader completed the conquest of Kievan Rus'?</h3><p>Batu</p><p>Batu</p><p>Genghis Khan's grandson Batu</p><h3>By what name was the Mongol army that finally conquered Bulgaria known?</h3><p>the Golden Horde</p><p>Golden Horde</p><p>the Golden Horde</p><h3>Which two Mongol leaders added Persia to the Mongol Empire?</h3><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><h3>When did Subutai's army return to Mongolia?</h3><p>1225</p><p>1225</p><p>1225</p><h3>Where did Jebe die?</h3><p>on the road back to Samarkand</p><p>on the road back to Samarkand</p><p>the road back to Samarkand</p><h2>In 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, Ganzhou, and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took Xiliang-fu[disambiguation needed]. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near Helan Mountains but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid siege to the Tangut city Lingzhou and crossed the Yellow River, defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.</h2><h3>In which year did Genghis Khan strike against the Tanguts?</h3><p>1226</p><p>1226</p><p>1226</p><h3>What season was it when Genghis Khan took Xiliang-fu from the Tanguts?</h3><p>autumn</p><p>autumn</p><p>autumn</p><h3>Who won the battle near the Helan mountains?</h3><p>the Mongols</p><p>Mongols</p><p>the Mongols</p><h3>What river did Genghis Khan cross before defeating the main Tangut army?</h3><p>the Yellow River</p><p>Yellow River</p><p>Yellow River</p><h3>What omen was Genghis Khan reported to have seen assuring his coming victory against the Tanguts?</h3><p>a line of five stars arranged in the sky</p><p>a line of five stars</p><p>a line of five stars arranged in the sky</p><h2>In 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing Lintiao-fu, Xining province, Xindu-fu, and Deshun province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to Liupanshan (Qingshui County, Gansu Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.</h2><h3>What was the name of the Tangut capital?</h3><p>Ning Hia</p><p>Ning Hia</p><p>Ning Hia</p><h3>Who was the Tangut general who fought Genghis Khan at Deshun?</h3><p>Ma Jianlong</p><p>Ma Jianlong</p><p>Ma Jianlong</p><h3>What weapon caused the wounds that killed Tangut general Ma Jianlong?</h3><p>arrows</p><p>arrows</p><p>arrows</p><h3>Where did Genghis Khan spend the summer after taking Deshun?</h3><p>Liupanshan</p><p>Liupanshan</p><p>Liupanshan</p><h3>What did Genghis Khan do to the Tangut imperial family after their surrender?</h3><p>executed</p><p>executed</p><p>executed</p><h2>The succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis' oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In The Secret History of the Mongols, just before the invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension, and possibly for other reasons, Ögedei was appointed as successor.</h2><h3>The paternity of which of Genghis Khan's sons was disputed?</h3><p>Jochi</p><p>Jochi</p><p>Jochi</p><h3>Which Mongol leader was most opposed to Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor?</h3><p>Chagatai</p><p>Chagatai</p><p>Chagatai</p><h3>Before which military campaign did Chagatai publicly dispute Jochi's paternity?</h3><p>invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire</p><p>invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire</p><p>invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire</p><h3>Who was appointed Genghis Khan's successor?</h3><p>Ögedei</p><p>Ögedei</p><p>Ögedei</p><h2>Genghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. Tolui, Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to Ögedei. Ögedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers.</h2><h3>Which pair of Genghis Khan's sons were most rivalrous?</h3><p>Chagatai and Jochi</p><p>Chagatai and Jochi</p><p>Chagatai and Jochi)</p><h3>Which of Genghis Khan's sons was disqualified from being successor because of his unstable behavior?</h3><p>Chagatai</p><p>Chagatai</p><p>Chagatai</p><h3>Which's of Genghis Khan's successors could not be successor because of his age?</h3><p>Tolui</p><p>Tolui</p><p>Tolui,</p><h3>Which son did Genghis Khan view as his most dependable one?</h3><p>Ögedei</p><p>Ögedei</p><p>Ögedei</p><h2>Jochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in Khorasan. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of Urgench. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: &quot;Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.&quot; Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.</h2><h3>Jochi's death occurred in what year?</h3><p>1226</p><p>1226</p><p>1226</p><h3>Where did Jochi remain after Genghis Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223?</h3><p>Khorasan</p><p>Khorasan</p><p>Khorasan</p><h3>Which territory did Jochi try to protect that may have led to a dispute with his brothers?</h3><p>Urgench</p><p>Urgench</p><p>Urgench</p><h3>Who did Jochi reportedly enlist to help him stop his father's massacres? </h3><p>Sultan Muhammad</p><p>Sultan Muhammad</p><p>Sultan Muhammad</p><h3>Why is Jochi's reported alliance with the Muslims historically suspect?</h3><p>Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223</p><p>Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223</p><p>Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223,</p><h2>In August 1227, during the fall of Yinchuan, the capital of Western Xia, Genghis Khan died. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the Western Xia, illness, falling from his horse, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle. According to The Secret History of the Mongols Genghis Khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury. He was already old and tired from his journeys. The Galician–Volhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign. Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis' death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty. One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.</h2><h3>Genghis Khan was in the process of taking what capital city when he died?</h3><p>Yinchuan</p><p>Yinchuan</p><p>Yinchuan</p><h3>What does the Secret History say Genghis Khan was doing when he sustained his mortal injuries?</h3><p>hunting</p><p>hunting</p><p>hunting</p><h3>What weapon did Marco Pole report as the cause of Genghis Khan's death?</h3><p>arrow</p><p>arrow</p><p>arrow wound</p><h3>Later chronicles of Genghis Khan's death implicate a princess from what empire in his death?</h3><p>Western Xia</p><p>Western Xia</p><p>Western Xia</p><h3>Which rival of the Mongols is suspected of inventing the story that Genghis Khan was murdered by a captured princess?</h3><p>Oirads</p><p>Oirads</p><p>Oirads</p><h2>Years before his death, Genghis Khan asked to be buried without markings, according to the customs of his tribe. After he died, his body was returned to Mongolia and presumably to his birthplace in Khentii Aimag, where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the Onon River and the Burkhan Khaldun mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried.

In 1949, as Communist troops advanced, the Nationalist soldiers moved it another 200 km farther west to the famous Tibetan monastery of Kumbum Monastery or Ta'er Shi near Xining, which soon fell under Communist control. In early 1954, Genghis Khan's bier and relics were returned to the Lord's Enclosure in Mongolia. By 1956 a new temple was erected there to house them.

The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of ethnicity and race in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in meritocracy. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size.

Women played a relatively important role in Mongol Empire and in family, for example Töregene Khatun was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire when next male Khagan was being chosen.

He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a Khitan prince, Chu'Tsai, who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply.

He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital Karakorum. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and Subutai and Jebe were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and Kievan Rus', an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.</h2><h3>Who among Genghis Khan's subjects shared similar privileges to his close family members'?</h3><p>his generals</p><p>Muqali, Jebe and Subutai</p><p>his generals</p><h3>What was the capital of the Mongol Empire?</h3><p>Karakorum</p><p>Karakorum</p><p>Karakorum</p><h3>Who was delegated command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty?</h3><p>Muqali</p><p>Muqali</p><p>Muqali,</p><h3>Which two generals raided the Caucasas and Kievan Rus' for Genghis Khan?</h3><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><p>Subutai and Jebe</p><h3>What did Genghis Khan expect from his generals alongside the autonomy he granted them?</h3><p>unwavering loyalty</p><p>unwavering loyalty</p><p>unwavering loyalty</p><h2>The Mongol military was also successful in siege warfare, cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard tactic of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced feigned retreat to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for ambush and counterattack.</h2><h3>What would Mongol armies divert in order to cut off the resources of cities they were attacking?</h3><p>rivers</p><p>rivers</p><p>rivers</p><h3>What were the cultural origins of the engineers and technology adopted by the Mongol military?</h3><p>Muslim and Chinese</p><p>Muslim and Chinese</p><p>Muslim and Chinese</p><h3>How did Mongol armies lure enemy groups out of their defensive positions?</h3><p>feigned retreat</p><p>feigned retreat</p><p>feigned retreat</p><h3>How were enemy prisoners used tactically by Mongol armies?</h3><p>driving them in front of the army</p><p>driving them in front of the army</p><p>driving them in front of the army</p><h2>Contrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer all the areas ultimately part of the Mongol Empire. At the time of his death, the Mongol Empire stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Sea of Japan. The empire's expansion continued for a generation or more after Genghis's death in 1227. Under Genghis's successor Ögedei Khan the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the Western Xia and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, and came into conflict with the imperial Song dynasty of China, starting a war that lasted until 1279 and that concluded with the Mongols gaining control of all of China. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.</h2><h3>What sea bordered Genghis Khan's empire to the east when he died?</h3><p>Sea of Japan</p><p>Sea of Japan</p><p>Caspian Sea to the Sea of Japan</p><h3>What body of water sat to the west of the Mongol Empire when Genghis Khan died?</h3><p>Caspian Sea</p><p>Caspian Sea</p><p>Caspian Sea to the Sea of Japan</p><h3>Who led the most rapid expansion of the Mongol Empire?</h3><p>Ögedei Khan</p><p>Ögedei Khan</p><p>Ögedei Khan</p><h3>What year was the conflict with the Song dynasty concluded?</h3><p>1279</p><p>1279</p><p>1279</p><h2>Genghis Khan is credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of meritocracy in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers. In Turkey, Genghis Khan is looked on as a great military leader, and it is popular for male children to carry his title as name.</h2><h3>To which trading route did Genghis Khan bring a stable political climate?</h3><p>the Silk Road</p><p>Silk Road</p><p>Silk Road</p><h3>In which Middle Eastern country is Genghis Khan's title a popular name for male children?</h3><p>Turkey</p><p>Turkey</p><p>Turkey,</p><h3>What was the Genghis Khan's characteristic approach to religious diversity?</h3><p>tolerant</p><p>tolerant</p><p>tolerant of religions</p><h3>What effect did Genghis Khan's career have on communication and trade across Asia?</h3><p>increased</p><p>expanding the horizons</p><p>increased communication and trade</p><h2>In the early 1990s the memory of Genghis Khan with the Mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the Mongolian People's Republic period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is looked upon positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as &quot;Genghis Khan's Mongolia&quot;, to themselves as &quot;Genghis Khan's children&quot;, and to Genghis Khan as the &quot;father of the Mongols&quot; especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.</h2><h3>What recent decade saw brightening of the perception of Genghis Khan in Mongolia?</h3><p>1990s</p><p>1990s</p><p>1990s</p><h3>What is the key accomplishment of Genghis Khan that modern Mongolians celebrate?</h3><p>uniting warring tribes</p><p>uniting warring tribes</p><p>uniting warring tribes</p><h3>How do Mongolians sometime describe their relationship to Genghis Khan?</h3><p>Genghis Khan's children</p><p>Genghis Khan's children</p><p>father of the Mongols</p><h3>What do some Mongolians feel non-Mongolian historians exaggerate about Genghis Khan?</h3><p>his brutality</p><p>butchery</p><p>his butchery</p><h3>What is the general perception of non-Mongolian histories of Genghis Khan by Mongolians themselves?</h3><p>unfairly biased</p><p>unfairly biased</p><p>his positive role is underrated</p><h2>In Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness are endorsed on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. &quot;Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,&quot; Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. &quot;Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,&quot; Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.</h2><h3>What is the Mongolian name of the first Mongolian laws codified in writing?</h3><p>Ikh Zasag</p><p>Ikh Zasag (</p><p>Ikh Zasag</p><h3>What did Mongolian President Tsakhiagian Elbegdorj note was significantly punished by Genghis Khan's laws?</h3><p>corruption and bribery</p><p>corruption and bribery</p><p>corruption and bribery</p><h3>Which Mongolian president lauded Genghis Khan on the 850th anniversary of the conqueror's birth?</h3><p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj</p><p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj</p><p>Elbegdorj</p><h3>What innovation in Mongolian language is credited to Genghis Khan?</h3><p>traditional Mongolian script</p><p>traditional Mongolian script</p><p>traditional Mongolian script</p><h2>There are conflicting views of Genghis Khan in the People's Republic of China with some viewing him positively in the Inner Mongolia region where there are a monument and buildings about him and where there is a considerable number of Mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million, almost twice the population of Mongolia. While Genghis Khan never conquered all of China, his grandson Kublai Khan completed that conquest and established the Yuan dynasty that is often credited with re-uniting China. There has been much artwork and literature praising Genghis as a great military leader and political genius. The years of the Mongol-established Yuan dynasty left an indelible imprint on Chinese political and social structures for subsequent generations with literature during the Jin dynasty relatively fewer. In general the legacy of Genghis Khan and his successors, who completed the conquest of China after 65 years of struggle, remains a mixed topic.[citation needed]</h2><h3>Where in China is Genghis Khan most favorably viewed today?</h3><p>Inner Mongolia region</p><p>Inner Mongolia region</p><p>Inner Mongolia region</p><h3>What is the population of the Inner Mongolia region of China?</h3><p>5 million</p><p>around 5 million</p><p>around 5 million</p><h3>Which descendant of Genghis Khan is remembered as having reunified China?</h3><p>Kublai Khan</p><p>Kublai Khan</p><p>Kublai Khan</p><h3>What Chinese dynasty did the Mongols found?</h3><p>Yuan</p><p>Yuan</p><p>Yuan dynasty</p><h3>What was Kublai Khan's relation to Genghis Khan?</h3><p>grandson</p><p>grandson</p><p>grandson</p><h2>In the Middle East, and particularly in Iran, Genghis Khan is almost universally condemned as a destructive and genocidal warlord who caused enormous damage and destruction to the population of these areas.

According to the works of the Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, the Mongols killed more than 70,000 people in Merv and more than 190,000 in Nishapur. In 1237 Batu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan, launched an invasion into Kievan Rus'.

However, it seems that if they had meant to call Genghis tenggis they could have said, and written, &quot;Tenggis Khan&quot;, which they did not.)
