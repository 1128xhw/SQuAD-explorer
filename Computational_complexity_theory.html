<html><body><div><h1>Computational_complexity_theory</h1><h2>Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.</h2><h3>What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?</h3><p>Computational complexity theory</p><p>Computational complexity theory</p><p>Computational complexity theory</p><h3>By what main attribute are computational problems classified utilizing computational complexity theory? </h3><p>inherent difficulty</p><p>their inherent difficulty</p><p>inherent difficulty</p><h3>What is the term for a task that generally lends itself to being solved by a computer?</h3><p>computational problems</p><p>A computational problem</p><p>computational problem</p><h2>A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.</h2><h3>What measure of a computational problem broadly defines the inherent difficulty of the solution?</h3><p>if its solution requires significant resources</p><p>its solution requires significant resources</p><p>if its solution requires significant resources</p><h3>What method is used to intuitively assess or quantify the amount of resources required to solve a computational problem?</h3><p>mathematical models of computation</p><p>mathematical models of computation</p><p>mathematical models of computation</p><h3>What are two basic primary resources used to guage complexity?</h3><p>time and storage</p><p>time and storage</p><p>time and storage</p><h3>What unit is measured to determine circuit complexity?</h3><p>number of gates in a circuit</p><p>number of gates in a circuit</p><p>number of gates</p><h3>What practical role does defining the complexity of problems play in everyday computing?</h3><p>determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do</p><p>what computers can and cannot do</p><p>determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do</p><h2>Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, it tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.</h2><h3>What two fields of theoretical computer science closely mirror computational complexity theory?</h3><p>analysis of algorithms and computability theory</p><p>analysis of algorithms and computability theory</p><p>analysis of algorithms and computability theory</p><h3>What field of computer science analyzes the resource requirements of a specific algorithm isolated unto itself within a given problem?</h3><p>analysis of algorithms</p><p>analysis of algorithms</p><p>analysis of algorithms</p><h3>What field of computer science analyzes all possible algorithms in aggregate to determine the resource requirements needed to solve to a given problem?  </h3><p>computational complexity theory</p><p>computational complexity theory</p><p>computational complexity theory</p><h3>What field of computer science is primarily concerned with determining the likelihood of whether or not a problem can ultimately be solved using algorithms?</h3><p>computability theory</p><p>computability theory</p><p>computability theory</p><h2>A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g. 15) and the solution is &quot;yes&quot; if the number is prime and &quot;no&quot; otherwise (in this case &quot;no&quot;). Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.</h2><h3>What is the name given to the input string of a computational problem?</h3><p>problem instance</p><p>a problem instance</p><p>problem instance</p><h3>In computational complexity theory, what is the term given to describe the baseline abstract question needing to be solved? </h3><p>the problem</p><p>a problem</p><p>problem</p><h3>Is a problem instance typically characterized as abstract or concrete?</h3><p>concrete</p><p>concrete</p><p>abstract</p><h3>What is another name for any given measure of input associated with a problem?</h3><p>instances</p><p>the instance</p><p>instance</p><h3>What is the general term used to describe the output to any given input in a problem instance?</h3><p>solution</p><p>the solution</p><p>solution</p><h2>To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.</h2><h3>By how many kilometers does the traveling salesman problem seek to classify a route between the 15 largest cities in Germany?</h3><p>2000</p><p>2000</p><p>2000</p><h3>What is one example of an instance that the quantitative answer to the traveling salesman problem fails to answer?</h3><p>round trip through all sites in Milan</p><p>asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km</p><p>a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km</p><h3>What does computational complexity theory most specifically seek to answer? </h3><p>computational problems</p><p>computational problems</p><p>computational problems</p><h2>When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.</h2><h3>In a computational problem, what can be described as a string over an alphabet?</h3><p>problem instance</p><p>a problem instance</p><p>problem instance</p><h3>What is the name of the alphabet is most commonly used in a problem instance?</h3><p>binary alphabet</p><p>binary</p><p>binary</p><h3>What is another term for the string of a problem instance?</h3><p>bitstrings</p><p>bitstrings</p><p>bitstrings</p><h3>In the encoding of mathematical objects, what is the way in which integers are commonly expressed?</h3><p>binary notation</p><p>binary notation</p><p>binary notation</p><h3>What is one way in which graphs can be encoded? </h3><p>adjacency matrices</p><p>directly via their adjacency matrices</p><h2>Decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an algorithm, whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes, the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.</h2><h3>What kind of problems are one of the main topics studied in computational complexity theory?</h3><p>Decision problems</p><p>Decision problems</p><p>Decision</p><h3>What are the two simple word responses to a decision problem?</h3><p>yes or no</p><p>yes or no</p><p>yes or no</p><h3>What are the two integer responses to a decision problem?</h3><p>1 or 0</p><p>1 or 0</p><p>1 or 0</p><h3>What will the output be for a member of the language of a decision problem?</h3><p>yes</p><p>yes</p><p>yes</p><h3>What answer denotes that an algorithm has accepted an input string?</h3><p>yes</p><p>yes</p><p>yes</p><h2>An example of a decision problem is the following.

However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a, b, c) such that the relation a × b = c holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.</h2><h3>How can function problems typically be restated?</h3><p>decision problems</p><p>as decision problems</p><p>as decision problems</p><h3>If two integers are multiplied and output a value, what is this expression set called?</h3><p>set of triples</p><p>triple</p><p>the set of triples (a, b, c) such that the relation a × b = c holds</p><h2>To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices?</h2><h3>What is a commonly used measurement used to determine the complexity of a computational problem?</h3><p>how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem</p><p>time</p><p>time</p><h3>What is one variable on which the running time may be contingent?</h3><p>the instance</p><p>the instance</p><p>the size of the instance</p><h3>How is the time needed to obtain the solution to a problem calculated?</h3><p>as a function of the size of the instance</p><p>as a function of the size of the instance</p><p>a function of the size of the instance</p><h3>In what unit is the size of the input measured?</h3><p>bits</p><p>bits</p><p>bits</p><h3>Complexity theory seeks to define the relationship between the scale of algorithms with respect to what other variable?</h3><p>an increase in the input size</p><p>input size</p><p>input size</p><h2>If the input size is n, the time taken can be expressed as a function of n. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n. If T(n) is a polynomial in n, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm.

It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.</h2><h3>What is the term for a mathematical model that theoretically represents a general computing machine?</h3><p>A Turing machine</p><p>A Turing machine</p><p>Turing machine</p><h3>It is generally assumed that a Turing machine can solve anything capable of also being solved using what?</h3><p>an algorithm</p><p>an algorithm</p><p>an algorithm</p><h3>What is the most commonplace model utilized in complexity theory?</h3><p>the Turing machine</p><p>the Turing machine</p><p>Turing machine</p><h3>What does a Turing machine handle on a strip of tape?</h3><p>symbols</p><p>symbols</p><p>symbols</p><h2>A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see non-deterministic algorithm.</h2><h3>What is generally considered to be the most basic iteration of a Turing machine?</h3><p>A deterministic Turing machine</p><p>deterministic</p><p>deterministic Turing machine</p><h3>What fixed set of factors determine the actions of a deterministic Turing machine</h3><p>rules</p><p>rules</p><p>a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions</p><h3>What is the term used to identify a deterministic Turing machine that has additional random bits?</h3><p>A probabilistic Turing machine</p><p>probabilistic</p><p>probabilistic Turing machine</p><h3>What type of Turing machine is capable of multiple actions and extends into a variety of computational paths?</h3><p>A non-deterministic Turing machine</p><p>non-deterministic</p><p>non-deterministic Turing machine</p><h3>What is the term given to algorithms that utilize random bits?</h3><p>randomized algorithms</p><p>randomized algorithms</p><p>randomized algorithms</p><h2>Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, quantum Turing machines, symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines.

They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.</h2><h3>What is an example of a measurement within a complexity class that would create a bigger set of problems if the bounds were relaxed?</h3><p>computation time</p><p>computation time</p><p>computation time</p><h3>In what expression can one expect to find DTIME(n)</h3><p>DTIME(n2)</p><p>DTIME(n2)</p><p>DTIME(n2)</p><h3>What theorems are responsible for determining questions of time and space requirements?</h3><p>time and space hierarchy theorems</p><p>time and space hierarchy theorems</p><p>time and space hierarchy theorems</p><h3>Resources are constrained by hierarchy theorems to produce what?</h3><p>a proper hierarchy on the classes defined</p><p>a proper hierarchy on the classes</p><p>a proper hierarchy</p><h3>What kind of statement is made in the effort of establishing the time and space requirements needed to enhance the ultimate number of problems solved?</h3><p>quantitative statements</p><p>quantitative</p><p>quantitative</p><h2>The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes.

A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, X is no more difficult than Y, and we say that X reduces to Y. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.</h2><h3>What concept is frequently used to define complexity classes?</h3><p>reduction</p><p>a reduction</p><p>reduction</p><h3>Reduction essentially takes one problem and converts into what?</h3><p>another problem</p><p>another problem</p><p>another problem</p><h3>According to reduction, if X and Y can be solved by the same algorithm then X performs what function in relationship to Y?</h3><p>reduces</p><p>reduces</p><p>X reduces to Y</p><h3>What are two examples of different types of reduction?</h3><p>Karp reductions and Levin reductions</p><p>Cook reductions, Karp reductions</p><h3>Polynomial time reductions are an example of what?</h3><p>the bound on the complexity of reductions</p><p>types of reductions</p><p>the bound on the complexity of reductions</p><h2>The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.</h2><h3>What is the most frequently employed type of reduction?</h3><p>polynomial-time reduction</p><p>polynomial-time</p><p>polynomial-time reduction</p><h3>What equates to a squared integer according to polynomial time reduction?</h3><p>multiplying two integers</p><p>multiplying two integers</p><p>multiplying two integers</p><h3>What measurement of time is used in polynomial time reduction?</h3><p>polynomial time</p><p>polynomial</p><p>polynomial time</p><h3>What would need to remain constant in a multiplication algorithm to produce the same outcome whether multiplying or squaring two integers?  </h3><p>input</p><p>input</p><p>input</p><h3>According to polynomial time reduction squaring can ultimately be logically reduced to what?</h3><p>multiplication</p><p>multiplication</p><p>multiplication</p><h2>This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.</h2><h3>The complexity of problems often depends on what?</h3><p>the type of reduction being used</p><p>the type of reduction being used</p><h3>What would create a conflict between a problem X and problem C within the context of reduction? </h3><p>if every problem in C can be reduced to X</p><p>problem in C is harder than X</p><h3>An algorithm for X which reduces to C would us to do what?</h3><p>solve any problem in C</p><p>solve any problem in C</p><p>solve any problem in C</p><h3>A problem set that that is hard for the expression NP can also be stated how?</h3><p>NP-hard</p><p>NP-hard</p><p>NP-hard problems</p><h2>If a problem X is in C and hard for C, then X is said to be complete for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P = NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP.</h2><h3>The hardest problems in NP can be analogously written as what class of problems?</h3><p>NP-complete</p><p>NP-complete</p><p>NP-complete</p><h3>NP complete problems contain the lowest likelihood of being located in what problem class?</h3><p>NP</p><p>P</p><p>P</p><h3>If P = NP is unsolved, and reduction is applied to a known NP-complete problem vis a vis Π2 to  Π1, what conclusion can be drawn for Π1?</h3><p>there is no known polynomial-time solution</p><p>no known polynomial-time solution</p><p>there is no known polynomial-time solution</p><h3>If polynomial time can be utilized within an NP-complete problem, what does the imply P is equal to?</h3><p>NP</p><p>NP</p><p>NP</p><h2>The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm.

No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) to factor an n-bit integer. However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time.

In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. In fact, the Cobham–Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 × 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n15, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.</h2><h3>Problems capable of theoretical solutions but consuming unreasonable time in practical application are known as what?</h3><p>intractable problems</p><p>intractable problems</p><p>intractable</p><p>intractable</p><h3>Intractable problems lacking polynomial time solutions necessarily negate the practical efficacy of what type of algorithm?</h3><p>exponential-time algorithms</p><p>exponential-time</p><p>exponential-time algorithms</p><p>exponential-time algorithms</p><h3>If NP is not equal to P, viewed through this lens, what type of problems can also be considered intractable?</h3><p>NP-complete problems</p><p>NP-complete</p><p>NP-complete</p><p>NP-complete</p><h2>What intractability means in practice is open to debate.
