<html><body><div><h1>Pharmacy</h1><h2>The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries. However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: φαρμακεία) derives from pharmakon (φάρμακον), meaning &quot;drug&quot;, &quot;medicine&quot; (or &quot;poison&quot;).[n 1]</h2><h3>What word is the word pharmacy taken from?</h3><p>its root word pharma</p><p>pharma</p><p>pharma</p><p>pharma</p><h3>What goods were sold in a pharma?</h3><p>ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines</p><p>ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines</p><p>ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines</p><p>medicines</p><h3>What did the Greek root pharmakos imply?</h3><p>sorcery or even poison</p><p>sorcery or even poison</p><p>sorcery</p><p>sorcery</p><h3>How would the word apothecary be viewed by contemporary English speakers?</h3><p>outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent</p><p>outdated</p><p>outdated</p><p>outdated</p><h3>What else was used by pharmas?</h3><p>many other herbs not listed</p><p>many other herbs</p><p>other herbs not listed</p><p>other herbs</p><h2>Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be small-business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual.</h2><h3>What type of professionals are pharmacists?</h3><p>healthcare professionals</p><p>healthcare</p><p>healthcare professionals with specialised education</p><h3>What types of health outcomes do pharmacists aim for with their patients?</h3><p>optimal health outcomes</p><p>optimal</p><p>optimal health outcomes</p><h3>What type of treatment are pharmacists important for?</h3><p>optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual</p><p>optimisation of a drug treatment</p><p>optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual</p><h3>What other role do many pharmacists play?</h3><p>small-business proprietors</p><p>small-business proprietors</p><p>small-business proprietors</p><h3>What types of preparation do pharmacists have?</h3><p>specialised education and training</p><p>specialised education and training</p><p>specialised education and training</p><h2>A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register. The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.</h2><h3>Who oversees a Pharmacy Technician in the UK?</h3><p>other senior pharmacy technicians</p><p>senior pharmacy technicians</p><p>other senior pharmacy technicians</p><h3>With what body must a pharmacy technician register?</h3><p>the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register</p><p>General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)</p><p>General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register</p><h3>What is a main duty of the GPhC?</h3><p>regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians</p><p>governing body for pharmacy health care professionals</p><p>regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians</p><h3>What type of professional is a Pharmacy Technician considered to be?</h3><p>health care professional</p><p>pharmacy health care</p><p>health care professional</p><h3>What types of responsibilities might a pharmacy technician have?</h3><p>manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice</p><p>manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas</p><p>manage the pharmacy department</p><h2>In Ancient Greece, Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants. He wrote several treatises on the topic. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation De Materia Medica (Concerning medical substances) was used a basis for many medieval texts, and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age. The title coined the term materia medica.</h2><h3>What is Pedanius Dioscorides known for?</h3><p>writing a five volume book in his native Greek</p><p>writing a five volume book</p><p>five volume book in his native Greek</p><h3>What is the name of the Latin translation of Dioscorides' book?</h3><p>De Materia Medica</p><p>De Materia Medica</p><p>De Materia Medica</p><h3>What term resulted from Dioscorides' book?</h3><p>materia medica</p><p>materia medica</p><p>materia medica</p><h3>Who was a man studying medicinal applicants of plants in Ancient Greece?</h3><p>Diocles of Carystus</p><p>Diocles of Carystus</p><p>Diocles of Carystus</p><h3>Who added to Dioscorides' book in the Islamic Golden Age?</h3><p>many middle eastern scientists</p><p>middle eastern scientists</p><p>many middle eastern scientists</p><h2>In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538–710) and the early Nara period (710–794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists—and even pharmacist assistants—were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.</h2><h3>How were the men who did tasks like those of today's pharmacists viewed in Japan in the Asuka and Nara periods?</h3><p>highly respected</p><p>highly respected</p><p>highly respected</p><h3>In which two codes were the roles of pharmacists codified?</h3><p>the Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code (718)</p><p>Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code</p><p>Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code</p><h3>What put a hierarchical structure in place?</h3><p>the pre-Heian Imperial court</p><p>Taihō Code</p><p>pre-Heian Imperial court</p><h3>What stature did pharmacists have in the pre-Heian Imperial court?</h3><p>status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists</p><p>Ranked positions</p><p>status superior to all others in health-related fields</p><h3>Where did the pharmacist stand in relation to the Emperor's personal physicians?</h3><p>ranked above</p><p>ranked above</p><p>ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor</p><h2>The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed]</h2><h3>Developments in which scientists influenced the creation of pharmacology in medieval Islam?</h3><p>botany and chemistry</p><p>botany and chemistry</p><p>advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry</p><h3>Who was influential in promoting the use of chemical compounds as medicines?</h3><p>Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi</p><p>Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi</p><p>Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi</p><h3>Who authored the Liber servitoris?</h3><p>Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi</p><p>Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi</p><p>Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi</p><h3>Who wrote about the distillation of drinking water from sea water?</h3><p>Al-Muwaffaq</p><p>Al-Muwaffaq</p><p>Al-Muwaffaq</p><h3>Which two compounds did Al-Muwaffaq differentiate between?</h3><p>sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate</p><p>sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate</p><p>sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate</p><h2>In Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422.

Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients.

Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy. For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine, neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.</h2><h3>Where do pharmacists acquire more preparation following pharmacy school?</h3><p>a pharmacy practice residency</p><p>pharmacy practice residency</p><p>pharmacy practice residency</p><h3>What do clinical pharmacists specialize in?</h3><p>various disciplines of pharmacy</p><p>various disciplines of pharmacy</p><p>various disciplines of pharmacy</p><h3>What is one issue that adds to the complexity of a pharmacist's job?</h3><p>effectiveness of treatment regimens</p><p>effectiveness of treatment regimens</p><p>effectiveness of treatment regimens</p><h3>Which pharmacists are likely to seek additional education following pharmacy school?</h3><p>pharmacists practicing in hospitals</p><p>pharmacists practicing in hospitals</p><p>clinical pharmacists</p><h2>Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications given intravenously. This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.</h2><h3>Where are many hospital pharmacies located?</h3><p>within the premises of the hospital</p><p>premises of the hospital</p><p>within the premises of the hospital</p><h3>In what form are most hospital medications?</h3><p>unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine</p><p>unit-dose</p><p>unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine</p><h3>What types of pharmacy functions have begun to be outsourced?</h3><p>high risk preparations and some other compounding functions</p><p>high risk preparations and some other compounding functions</p><p>high risk preparations and some other compounding functions</p><h3>What is one factor that increases the importance of the pharmacy performing at a high level?</h3><p>The high cost of medications and drug-related technology</p><p>high cost of medications</p><p>high cost of medications and drug-related technology</p><h3>What are some advantages of hospital pharmacies?</h3><p>Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications</p><p>more specialized medications</p><p>stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications</p><h2>Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.

Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings. Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings.

The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take.

In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs. It is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.</h2><h3>What is the fastest growing area in the pharmaceutical industry?</h3><p>specialty pharmacies</p><p>specialty pharmacies</p><p>specialty pharmacies</p><h3>How many drugs approved by the FDA in 2013 were specialty drugs?</h3><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications</p><h3>What types of diseases are specialty drugs often used against?</h3><p>cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis</p><p>chronic and complex disease states</p><p>chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis</p><h3>What types of medications do specialty pharmacies stock?</h3><p>novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed</p><p>novel medications</p><p>novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed</p><h3>Besides drugs, what else do specialty pharmacies provide?</h3><p>lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs</p><p>lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies</p><p>lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs</p><h2>In most jurisdictions (such as the United States), pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians. These jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public, and that pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them &quot;kickback&quot; payments. However, the American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere. 7 to 10 percent of American physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own.</h2><h3>How are pharmacists regulated in most jurisdictions?</h3><p>separately from physicians</p><p>separately from physicians</p><p>separately from physicians</p><h3>Who do most jurisdictions say can give scheduled drugs to the public?</h3><p>only pharmacists</p><p>only pharmacists</p><p>only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public</p><h3>What body has stated that physicians can also dispense drugs under specific conditions?</h3><p>the American Medical Association (AMA)</p><p>American Medical Association</p><p>American Medical Association (AMA)</p><h3>What is the estimate of how many physicians give out drugs on their own?</h3><p>7 to 10 percent</p><p>7 to 10 percent</p><p>7 to 10 percent of American physicians</p><h3>What are pharmacists forbidden to do?</h3><p>form business partnerships with physicians or give them &quot;kickback&quot; payments</p><p>form business partnerships with physicians</p><p>pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them &quot;kickback&quot; payments</p><h2>In some rural areas in the United Kingdom, there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices. The law requires that the GP practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified, minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometres) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy. This law also exists in Austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away, or where none is registered in the city.</h2><h3>What is another country that permits physicians to give out drugs from within their practice?</h3><p>Austria</p><p>Austria</p><p>Austria</p><h3>Where are some physicians permitted to prescribe and give out medications within their practices?</h3><p>In some rural areas in the United Kingdom</p><p>rural areas in the United Kingdom</p><p>prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices</p><h3>What is the minimum distance between a patient's home and the nearest pharmacy that allows a physician to give out medication?</h3><p>1.6 kilometres</p><p>1.6 kilometres</p><p>1.6 kilometres</p><h3>What is the minimum distance between a patient's home and the nearest pharmacy that allows a physician in Austria to give out medicine?</h3><p>more than 4 kilometers</p><p>4 kilometers</p><p>more than 4 kilometers</p><h2>The reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers. Otherwise, the physician has a financial self-interest in &quot;diagnosing&quot; as many conditions as possible, and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient. Such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects. This system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments.[citation needed]</h2><h3>Why is majority rule used?</h3><p>the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers</p><p>high risk of a conflict of interest</p><p>high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers</p><h3>Why might a physician diagnose a large number of conditions?</h3><p>because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient</p><p>sell more medications to the patient</p><p>sell more medications to the patient</p><h3>What do rules about conflict of interest involving doctors diagnosing patients resemble?</h3><p>the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments.</p><p>checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments</p><p>similarity to the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments</p><h3>How else might a physician take advantage of self-interest?</h3><p>exaggerating their seriousness</p><p>avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects</p><p>because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient</p><h3>Where might the doctor's self-interest be at odds with the patient's self-interest?</h3><p>in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects</p><p>obtaining cost-effective medication</p><p>the physician has a financial self-interest in &quot;diagnosing&quot; as many conditions as possible</p><h2>In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills. In particular, Medication Therapy Management (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients. Such services include the thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual. The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.</h2><h3>What will be the importance of the pharmacist in coming decades?</h3><p>expected to become more integral within the health care system</p><p>patient care skills</p><p>pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system</p><h3>What responsibilities are pharmacists believed to be taking on more in the future?</h3><p>increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills</p><p>patient care skills</p><p>pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills</p><h3>What is included in Medication Therapy Management?</h3><p>clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients</p><p>clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients</p><p>the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients</p><h3>What are examples of clinical services that pharmacists can provide?</h3><p>thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual</p><p>thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.</p><p>the thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual</p><h3>What are outcomes expected with Medication Therapy Management?</h3><p>a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system</p><p>increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs</p><p>a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system</p><h2>This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of &quot;senior care pharmacy.&quot;</h2><h3>Which provinces in Canada limit the rights of pharmacists in prescribing?</h3><p>Alberta and British Columbia</p><p>Alberta and British Columbia</p><p>Alberta and British Columbia</p><h3>Who pays Australian pharmacists for doing Home Medicines Reviews?</h3><p>the Australian Government</p><p>Australian Government</p><p>the Australian Government</p><h3>What are pharmacists in the United Kingdom being increasingly paid for?</h3><p>medicine use reviews</p><p>medicine use reviews</p><p>medicine use reviews</p><h3>What fields have increased in influence on pharmacy in the United States?</h3><p>pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy</p><p>pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy</p><p>pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy</p><h3>What degree is now mandatory in the U.S. in order to be a licensed pharmacist?</h3><p>Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.

The show globe was also used until the early 20th century. Pharmacy organizations often use other symbols, such as the Bowl of Hygieia which is often used in the Netherlands, conical measures, and caduceuses in their logos. Other symbols are common in different countries: the green Greek cross in France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India, the increasingly rare Gaper in the Netherlands, and a red stylized letter A in Germany and Austria (from Apotheke, the German word for pharmacy, from the same Greek root as the English word 'apothecary').</h2><h3>What are the two symbols that signify pharmacy in English-speaking countries?</h3><p>the mortar and pestle and the ℞ (recipere) character</p><p>mortar and pestle and the ℞ (recipere) character</p><p>the mortar and pestle and the ℞ (recipere) character</p><h3>What symbol was employed until early in the 20th century?</h3><p>The show globe</p><p>show globe</p><p>show globe</p><h3>What country uses the Bowl of Hygieia as a symbol of pharmacy?</h3><p>the Netherlands</p><p>the Netherlands</p><p>the Netherlands</p><h3>What countries use a red stylized A to signify pharmacy?</h3><p>Germany and Austria</p><p>Germany and Austria</p><p>Germany and Austria</p><h3>Which countries use the green Greek cross as a symbol of pharmacy?</h3><p>France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India</p><p>France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India</p><p>France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India</p></div></body></html>
