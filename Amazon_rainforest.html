<html><body><div><h1>Amazon_rainforest</h1><h2>The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amazônica or Amazônia; Spanish: Selva Amazónica, Amazonía or usually Amazonia; French: Forêt amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain &quot;Amazonas&quot; in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.</h2><h3>Which name is also used to describe the Amazon rainforest in English?</h3><p>also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle,</p><p>Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle</p><p>Amazonia</p><h3>How many square kilometers of rainforest is covered in the basin?</h3><p>5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.</p><p>5,500,000</p><p>5,500,000</p><h3>How many nations control this region in total?</h3><p>This region includes territory belonging to nine nations.</p><p>nine</p><p>nine</p><h3>How many nations contain &quot;Amazonas&quot; in their names?</h3><p>States or departments in four nations contain &quot;Amazonas&quot; in their names.</p><p>four</p><p>four</p><h3>What percentage does the Amazon represents in rainforests on the planet?</h3><p>The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests</p><p>over half</p><h3>What is the Dutch word for the Amazon rainforest?</h3><p>Amazoneregenwoud</p><p>Amazoneregenwoud</p><p>Amazoneregenwoud</p><h3>What rainforest covers the majority of the Amazon basin in South America?</h3><p>The Amazon rainforest</p><p>Amazon rainforest</p><p>The Amazon</p><h3>In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?</h3><p>Brazil</p><p>Brazil</p><p>Brazil</p><h3>The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?</h3><p>over half</p><p>over half</p><p>over half</p><h3>How many species of trees can be found in the Amazon rainforest?</h3><p>16,000</p><p>16,000</p><p>16,000</p><h3>What kind of forest is the Amazon rainforest?</h3><p>moist broadleaf forest</p><p>moist broadleaf forest</p><p>tropical</p><h3>How many square kilometers is the Amazon Basin?</h3><p>7,000,000 square kilometres (2,70</p><p>7,000,000</p><p>7,000,000 square kilometres</p><h3>How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?</h3><p>nine nations</p><p>nine</p><p>nine</p><h3>Which nation contains the majority of the amazon forest?</h3><p>Brazil</p><p>Brazil</p><p>Brazil</p><h3>What is the estimate for the amount of tree species in the amazon tropical rain forest?</h3><p>16,000 species</p><p>16,000</p><p>16,000</p><h2>Following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. From 66–34 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45°. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.</h2><h3>Which type of climate may have allowed the rainforest to spread across the continent?</h3><p>the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.</p><p>wetter</p><p>wetter</p><h3>What has allowed for the Savanna region to expand into the tropics?</h3><p>Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.</p><p>Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years</p><p>Climate fluctuations</p><h3>During what time did the rainforest spanned a narrow band? </h3><p>During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band.</p><p>Oligocene</p><p>Oligocene</p><h3>When did it retract to a inland formation?</h3><p>It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum.</p><p>Middle Miocene</p><p>at the last glacial maximum</p><h3>Did the rainforest managed to thrive during the glacial periods? </h3><p>However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.</p><p>still managed to thrive</p><h3> What may have caused rainforests to grow across South America?</h3><p>the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate</p><p>extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate</p><p>extinction of the dinosaurs</p><h3>How many degrees south did the Amazon rainforest reach from 66-34 Mya?</h3><p>45</p><p>45°</p><p>45°</p><h3>What has caused savanna regions to grow into the South American tropics in the last 34 million years?</h3><p>Climate fluctuations</p><p>Climate fluctuations</p><p>Climate fluctuations</p><h3>During which period in history was the Amazon rainforest a narrow band of forest?</h3><p>Oligocene</p><p>Oligocene</p><p>Oligocene</p><h3>What did the Amazon rainforest do during the Middle Miocene?</h3><p>It expanded</p><p>expanded</p><p>expanded</p><h3>What extinction event might have created some conditions allowing the expansion of the amazon rainforest?</h3><p>Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</p><p>dinosaurs</p><p>dinosaurs</p><h3>Beginning how many years ago did the amazon rainforest extend 45 degrees south?</h3><p>66–34 Mya</p><p>66–34</p><h3>After the Oligocene period, under what period did the amazon rainforest begin to expand?</h3><p>Middle Miocene</p><p>Middle Miocene</p><p>Middle Miocene</p><h3>The amazon rainforest became a mostly inland forest around which global event?</h3><p>last glacial maximum</p><p>last glacial maximum</p><p>last glacial maximum</p><h3>Savannah areas expanded over the last how many years?</h3><p>34 million years</p><p>34 million</p><p>34 million</p><h2>During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch.

Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.</h2><h3>What does LGM stands for?</h3><p>Last Glacial Maximum</p><p>Last Glacial Maximum</p><p>Last Glacial Maximum</p><h3>What did

was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.</h2><h3>What is the name of the book written by Archeologist Betty Meggers?</h3><p>Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise.</p><h3>What is the maximum square miles did Betty Meggers claim that can be sustained in the rainforest? </h3><p>0.52/sq mi</p><p>0.52</p><p>0.52/sq mi</p><h3>What would be needed to host a larger population?</h3><p>agriculture</p><p>agriculture</p><p>agriculture</p><h3>Which findings suggested that the region was densely populated? </h3><p>anthropological</p><p>anthropological</p><p>recent anthropological</p><h3>How many people may have lived in the Amazon region during AD 1500?</h3><p>5 million</p><p>5 million</p><p>5 million</p><h3>What feature of the Amazon made people believe it couldn't have many inhabitants?</h3><p>the poor soil</p><p>poor soil</p><p>poor soil.</p><h3>What well-known archeologist believed the Amazon didn't have many inhabitants?</h3><p>Betty Meggers</p><p>Betty Meggers</p><p>Betty Meggers</p><h3>How many inhabitants did Betty Meggers believe could occupy each square kilometre of the Amazon?</h3><p>0.2</p><p>0.2</p><p>0.2</p><h3>In what book did Betty Meggers describe the idea of the Amazon being sparsely populated?</h3><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><h3>Which archaeologist proposed the idea that the Amazon rainforest couldn't sustain large populations? </h3><p>Betty Meggers</p><p>Betty Meggers</p><p>Betty Meggers</p><h3>Which book discussed the theory about low populations in the Amazon rainforest?</h3><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><p>Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise</p><h3>What was the theorized maximum population density per square kilometre for the Amazon rainforest?</h3><p>0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre</p><p>0.2 inhabitants</p><p>0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre</p><h3>In 1500 AD how many people were believed to have lived in the Amazon region?</h3><p>5 million people</p><p>5 million</p><p>Some 5 million</p><h3>In the 1980s what was the population of the amazon region?</h3><p>200,000.</p><p>less than 200,000</p><p>less than 200,000</p><h2>The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox. Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0–1250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre.

In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida.

The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.</h2><h3>What is the process of removing trees from a forest known as?</h3><p>Deforestation</p><p>Deforestation</p><p>Deforestation</p><h3>Acessing the Amazon rainforest was restricted before what era?</h3><p>the early 1960s</p><p>early 1960s</p><p>1960s</p><h3>What method was used to clear forest for crop cultivation in the amazon forest?</h3><p>slash and burn method</p><p>slash and burn</p><p>slash and burn</p><h3>What are two factors that made it difficult for colonists to the Amazon forest to survive?</h3><p>loss of soil fertility and weed invasion</p><p>loss of soil fertility and weed invasion</p><p>soil fertility and weed invasion</p><h3>What is notable about the Amazon forest when it is seen from space?</h3><p>areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye</p><p>areas cleared of forest</p><p>areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye</p><h2>Between 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres (160,000 to 227,000 sq mi), with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle. Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.</h2><h3>How many square kilometres of the Amazon forest was lost by 1991?</h3><p>415,000</p><p>415,000 to 587,000</p><p>415,000</p><h3>In the year 2000 how many square kilometres of the Amazon forest had been lost?</h3><p>587,000</p><p>587,000</p><p>587,000</p><h3>What is most of the cleared land in the Amazon region used for?</h3><p>pasture for cattle</p><p>pasture for cattle</p><p>pasture for cattle</p><h3>Where is Brazil ranked globally in soybean production?</h3><p>second-largest global producer</p><p>second</p><p>second-largest</p><h3>What percentage of the land cleared in the Amazon is used for growing livestock?</h3><p>91%</p><p>91</p><p>91%</p><h2>The needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the Amazon.
