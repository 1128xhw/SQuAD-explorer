<html><body><div><h1>Super_Bowl_50</h1><h2>Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the &quot;golden anniversary&quot; with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as &quot;Super Bowl L&quot;), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.</h2><h3>Which NFL team represented the AFC at Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><h3>Which NFL team represented the NFC at Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>Carolina Panthers</p><p>Carolina Panthers</p><p>Carolina Panthers</p><h3>Where did Super Bowl 50 take place?</h3><p>Santa Clara, California</p><p>Levi's Stadium</p><p>Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California.</p><h3>Which NFL team won Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><h3>What color was used to emphasize the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl?</h3><p>gold</p><p>gold</p><p>gold</p><h3>What was the theme of Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>&quot;golden anniversary&quot;</p><p>gold-themed</p><p>&quot;golden anniversary</p><h3>What day was the game played on?</h3><p>February 7, 2016</p><p>February 7</p><p>February 7, 2016</p><h3>What is the AFC short for?</h3><p>American Football Conference</p><p>American Football Conference</p><p>American Football Conference</p><h3>What was the theme of Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>&quot;golden anniversary&quot;</p><p>gold-themed</p><p>gold</p><h3>What does AFC stand for?</h3><p>American Football Conference</p><p>American Football Conference</p><p>American Football Conference</p><h3>What day was the Super Bowl played on?</h3><p>February 7, 2016</p><p>February 7</p><p>February 7, 2016</p><h3>Who won Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><h3>What venue did Super Bowl 50 take place in?</h3><p>Levi's Stadium</p><p>Levi's Stadium</p><p>Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara</p><h3>What city did Super Bowl 50 take place in?</h3><p>Santa Clara</p><p>Santa Clara</p><p>Santa Clara</p><h3>If Roman numerals were used, what would Super Bowl 50 have been called?</h3><p>Super Bowl L</p><p>L</p><p>Super Bowl L</p><h3>Super Bowl 50 decided the NFL champion for what season?</h3><p>2015</p><p>the 2015 season</p><p>2015</p><h3>What year did the Denver Broncos secure a Super Bowl title for the third time?</h3><p>2015</p><p>2016</p><p>2015</p><h3>What city did Super Bowl 50 take place in?</h3><p>Santa Clara</p><p>Santa Clara</p><p>Santa Clara</p><h3>What stadium did Super Bowl 50 take place in?</h3><p>Levi's Stadium</p><p>Levi's Stadium</p><p>Levi's Stadium</p><h3>What was the final score of Super Bowl 50? </h3><p>24–10</p><p>24–10</p><p>24–10</p><h3>What month, day and year did Super Bowl 50 take place? </h3><p>February 7, 2016</p><p>February 7, 2016</p><p>February 7, 2016</p><h3>What year was Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>2015</p><p>2016</p><p>2016</p><h3>What team was the AFC champion?</h3><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><h3>What team was the NFC champion?</h3><p>Carolina Panthers</p><p>Carolina Panthers</p><p>Carolina Panthers</p><h3>Who won Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><h3>Super Bowl 50 determined the NFL champion for what season?</h3><p>2015</p><p>the 2015 season</p><p>2015</p><h3>Which team won Super Bowl 50.</h3><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><h3>Where was Super Bowl 50 held?</h3><p>Santa Clara, California.</p><p>Levi's Stadium</p><p>Levi's Stadium</p><h3>The name of the NFL championship game is?</h3><p>Super Bowl</p><p>Super Bowl</p><p>Super Bowl</p><h3>What 2015 NFL team one the AFC playoff?</h3><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><p>Denver Broncos</p><h2>The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP).

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.</h2><h3>Who is the head coach of the Broncos?</h3><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Kubiak</p><h3>Who played quarterback for the Broncos after Peyton Manning was benched?</h3><p>Brock Osweiler</p><p>Brock Osweiler</p><p>Osweiler</p><h3>Who did Peyton Manning play for as a rookie?</h3><p>Indianapolis Colts</p><p>the Indianapolis Colts</p><p>Colts</p><h3>Who did the Broncos play in the last week of the regular season?</h3><p>San Diego Chargers</p><p>San Diego Chargers</p><p>Chargers</p><h3>Who is Denver's defensive coordinator?</h3><p>Wade Phillips</p><p>Wade Phillips</p><p>Phillips</p><h3>How many years was John Fox the head coach of the Denver Broncos?</h3><p>four</p><p>four</p><p>four</p><h3>What is the name of the Bronco's head coach, who was hired after John Fox? </h3><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Kubiak</p><h3>What was the first team Peyton Manning began playing for?</h3><p>Indianapolis Colts</p><p>the Indianapolis Colts</p><p>1998</p><h3>How old was Peyton Manning in 2015?</h3><p>39</p><p>39</p><p>39</p><h3>In the 10th week of the 2015 season, what injury was Peyton Manning dealing with?</h3><p>plantar fasciitis</p><p>a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis</p><h3>When John Fox left as head coach for the Broncos, who replaced him?</h3><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Kubiak</p><h3>Who was the quarterback for the Broncos 2015 season?</h3><p>Peyton Manning</p><p>Peyton Manning</p><p>Manning</p><h3>What injury did Manning suffer the summer before the season started?</h3><p>a plantar fasciitis injury</p><p>a plantar fasciitis injury</p><p>plantar fasciitis</p><h3>How old was Manning at the beginning of the 2015 season?</h3><p>39</p><p>39</p><p>39</p><h3>How many games did the Broncos lose during their regular 2015 season?</h3><p>four</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><h3>What coach left the Broncos after the season prior to Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>John Fox</p><p>John Fox</p><p>Fox</p><h3>According to game stats, which Super Bowl 50 quarterback had his worst year since his first season as a player in the NFL?</h3><p>Peyton Manning</p><p>Peyton Manning</p><p>Manning</p><h3>Who was the Denver head coach for Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Gary Kubiak</p><p>Kubiak</p><h3>What foot was injured on Manning that sidelined him in week 10?</h3><p>left foot.</p><p>left</p><p>left</p><h3>Who was the defensive coordinator for the Broncos in 2015?</h3><p>Wade Phillips</p><p>Wade Phillips</p><p>Phillips</p><h2>Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.

The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.</h2><h3>When did the NFL announce the suspension of using Roman numerals to brand the Super Bowl?</h3><p>June 4, 2014</p><p>On June 4, 2014</p><p>2014</p><h3>What was the first Super Bowl branded with Roman numerals?</h3><p>Super Bowl V</p><p>Super Bowl V</p><p>V</p><h3>Who is the NFL's vice president of brand and creative?</h3><p>Jaime Weston</p><p>Jaime Weston</p><p>Weston</p><h3>What was the first Super Bowl to use the standardized logo template?</h3><p>Super Bowl XLV</p><p>Super Bowl XLV</p><p>V</p><h3>Who is the trophy featured on the logo named for?</h3><p>Vince Lombardi</p><p>Vince Lombardi Trophy</p><p>Lombardi</p><h3>In what year was it declared that no Roman numerals would be used in the name of the 50th Super Bowl?</h3><p>2014</p><p>2014</p><p>2014</p><h3>Which Super Bowl, after the 50th one, will begin have Roman numerals in the title again?</h3><p>Super Bowl LI</p><p>LI</p><p>LI</p><h3>If Roman numerals were used in the naming of the 50th Super Bowl, which one would have been used?</h3><p>L</p><p>L</p><p>L</p><h3>What color are the numbers in the Super Bowl 50 logo? </h3><p>gold</p><p>gold</p><p>gold</p><h3>When did the NFL announce that it would not use Roman numbers to designate the Super Bowl number?</h3><p>June 4, 2014</p><p>On June 4, 2014</p><p>2014</p><h3>Rather than Roman numerals, what did the NFL decide to use?</h3><p>Arabic numerals</p><p>Arabic numerals</p><p>Arabic</p><h3>What is the Roman numeral for 50?</h3><p>L.</p><p>L</p><p>L</p><h3>Normally silver, what color was used for the number 50?</h3><p>gold</p><p>gold</p><p>gold</p><h3>When will Roman numerals be used again to denote the Super Bowl number?</h3><p>Super Bowl LI.</p><p>Super Bowl LI</p><p>Super Bowl LI</p><h3>What type of numeral did the latest Super Bowl use to designate the game number?</h3><p>Arabic</p><p>Arabic numerals</p><p>Arabic</p><h3>What is the Roman numeral going to be for Super Bowl 51?</h3><p>LI.</p><p>LI</p><p>LI</p><h2>Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the &quot;Golden Super Bowl&quot;; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL's properties and painted on fields, the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos.

Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line.

After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession.</h2><h3>Who was on the receiving end of a 45-yard pass from Cam Newton?</h3><p>Ted Ginn Jr.</p><p>Ted Ginn Jr</p><p>Ted Ginn Jr</p><h3>Who missed a field goal for the Panthers?</h3><p>Graham Gano</p><p>Graham Gano</p><p>Gano</p><h3>How many yards was the missed field goal?</h3><p>44</p><p>44</p><p>44</p><h3>What kicker was successful on a 33-yard field goal?</h3><p>McManus</p><p>McManus</p><p>McManus</p><h3>Who picked off Cam Newton and subsequently fumbled the ball?</h3><p>T.

A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10.

On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it, Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism. Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives, but failed to get a first down on each one.</h2><h3>On what yard line did Carolina begin with 4:51 left in the game?</h3><p>24</p><p>their own 24</p><p>24</p><h3>Who fumbled the ball on 3rd-and-9?</h3><p>Newton</p><p>Newton</p><p>Newton</p><h3>What Panther defender was called for holding on third down?</h3><p>Josh Norman</p><p>Josh Norman</p><p>Norman</p><h3>What player punched the ball in from the 2?</h3><p>Anderson</p><p>Anderson</p><p>Anderson</p><h3>Who was the receiver on the successful 2-point conversion?</h3><p>Bennie Fowler</p><p>Bennie Fowler</p><p>Fowler</p><h3>Who stripped the ball from Newton on a 3rd and nine?</h3><p>Miller</p><p>Miller</p><p>Miller</p><h3>Who recovered the strip ball?</h3><p>wards</p><p>Ward</p><p>Ward</p><h3>Which player was criticized for not jumping into the pile to recover the ball?</h3><p>Newton</p><p>Newton</p><p>Newton</p><h3>Which Panthers player got a penalty, which gave the Broncos a new set of downs?</h3><p>Josh Norman</p><p>Josh Norman</p><p>Norman</p><h3>How much time was left in the game when Denver took the score to 24-10?</h3><p>3:08</p><p>3:08</p><p>3:08</p><h3>What was the time on the clock when Carolina got the ball to their 24-yard line in the fourth quarter?</h3><p>4:51</p><p>4:51</p><p>4:51</p><h3>What was the last name of the player who took the ball away from Newton late in the fourth quarter?</h3><p>Miller</p><p>Miller</p><p>Miller</p><h3>What is the last name of the player who finally recovered the ball Newton lost in the fourth quarter?</h3><p>wards</p><p>Ward</p><p>Ward</p><h3>How many plays was Denver kept out of the end zone after getting the ball from Newton?</h3><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><h3>What is the last name of the player who scored a 2-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter?</h3><p>Anderson</p><p>Anderson</p><p>Anderson</p><h2>Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception and zero touchdowns.

Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team. The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. The Broncos' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks. Jordan Norwood's 61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down, while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15. The two teams' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low. Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams, while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player.</h2><h3>How many total yards did Denver gain?</h3><p>194</p><p>194</p><p>194</p><h3>How many first downs did Denver have?</h3><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><h3>What team had 244 yards in Super Bowl XXXV?</h3><p>Baltimore Ravens</p><p>the Baltimore Ravens</p><p>Ravens</p><h3>Who returned a punt for 61 yards, setting a new Super Bowl record?</h3><p>Jordan Norwood</p><p>Jordan Norwood</p><p>Norwood</p><h3>Who is the only quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two teams?</h3><p>Manning</p><p>Manning</p><p>Manning</p><h3>How many yards did Denver have for Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>194</p><p>194</p><p>194</p><h3>How many first downs did Denver have for Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><h3>Who did the Broncos tie with the most sacks in a Super Bowl?</h3><p>Chicago Bears</p><p>the Chicago Bears</p><p>Bears</p><h3>Which team did Gary Kubiak play for when he was in the Super Bowl?</h3><p>Broncos</p><p>Denver</p><p>Denver</p><h3>How many first downs did the Panthers have in Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><h3>How many first downs did the Broncos have in Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><h3>What team had the lowest downs and yards ever in the Super Bowl as of Super Bowl 50?</h3><p>The Broncos</p><p>Denver</p><p>Denver</p><h3>What team di the Broncos tie a Super Bowl record for in sacks?</h3><p>Chicago Bears</p><p>the Chicago Bears</p><p>Bears</p><h3>How many teams has Manning won the Super Bowl with?</h3><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p></div></body></html>
