Their most distinctive feature is the ‘combs’ – groups of cilia which they use for swimming – they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia. Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size. Like cnidarians, their bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration. Increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong

and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. In favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day. Only 100–150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla (&quot;little tentacles&quot;) that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much can Ctenophores eat in one day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer

class="col-md-6"><pre>Most species are hermaphrodites—a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong

may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains. One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sea were Ctenophores accidently introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> the Black Sea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Black Sea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Black Sea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What specific type of Ctenophore was introduced into the Black Sea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Mnemiopsis</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Mnemiopsis</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Mnemiopsis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What promoted the growrth of Mnemiposis in the Black Sea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> over-fishing and long-term environmental changes</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> over-fishing and long-term environmental changes</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> long-term environmental changes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Beroe eat?

The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the &quot;cydippids&quot; are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction happen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> 66 million years ago</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> 515 million years ago</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> 66 million years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Evidence indicates that Cydippids are not what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> &quot;cydippids&quot; are not monophyletic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old are the fossils found that represent ctenophhores ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> 515 million years</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> 66 million years ago</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> 515 million years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the fossils that were found to represent ctenphores missing that current ctenphora have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> tentacles</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> tentacles</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> tentacles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Fossils found that were believed to be ctenophores were how old?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> 515 million years</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> 66 million years</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> 515 million years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event happened 66 million years ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Cypiddids are not what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do current ctenophores have that fossils found did not have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> tentacles</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> tentacles</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> tentacles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals).

The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth (the &quot;oral pole&quot;) to the opposite end (the &quot;aboral pole&quot;), and are spaced more or less evenly around the body, although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth. The &quot;combs&quot; (also called &quot;ctenes&quot; or &quot;comb plates&quot;) run across each row, and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia, up to 2 millimeters (0.079 in). Unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function. These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth, although they can also reverse direction. Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing, unlike jellyfish. When trying to escape predators, one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior, by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the eight comb rows on the outer surface called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> swimming-plates</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> swimming-plates</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> swimming-plates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Combs are called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> also called &quot;ctenes&quot; or &quot;comb plates</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> &quot;ctenes&quot; or &quot;comb plates&quot;</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> ctenes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the 9 +3 pattern of cilia thought to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> supporting function</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> suspected to have a supporting function</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> a supporting function</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What direction do ctenophore swim?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> in the direction in which the mouth is pointing,</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> the direction in which the mouth is pointing</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> direction in which the mouth is pointing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Cilia can g ow up too what length?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> 2 millimeters (0.079 in)</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> 2 millimeters</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> 2 millimeters</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities.

The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the tentacles of cydipped ctenophores are usually fringed with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> tentilla</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> tentilla</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> tentilla</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are colloblasts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes the tentilla of euplokamis different from other cysippids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> they contain striated muscle,</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> they contain striated muscle</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> they contain striated muscle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many types of movements do euplokamis tentilla have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> three types of movement</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> three</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the euplokamis use the three types of movement for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> capturing prey</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> capturing prey</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> capturing prey</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced evenly round the body.

Velamen parallelum, which is typically less than 20 centimeters (0.66 ft) long, can move much faster in what has been described as a &quot;darting motion&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which species are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> The Cestida</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Cestida</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Cestida</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the largest ctenophore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Cestum veneris</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Cestum veneris</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> up to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) long</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are cestida called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> belt animals</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> belt animals</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> &quot;belt animals&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do cestids swim?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows.</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> undulating their bodies</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which species moves by a darting motion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Velamen parallelum</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Velamen parallelum</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Velamen parallelum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction, with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface.

If food is plentiful, they can eat 10 times their own weight per day. While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in size from the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as &quot;webs&quot;, some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled &quot;cydippid&quot; Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are ctenophores predators, vegetarian or parasitic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Almost all ctenophores are predators</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> predators</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> predators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Haeckelia prey mostly on what animal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> jellyfish</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> jellyfish</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> jellyfish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens to the jellyfish nematocysts when they are eaten by the haeckelia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the bolinopsis generally eat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the two-tentacled cydippid that feedsentirely on salps called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Lampea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Lampea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Lampea</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ctenophores used to be regarded as &quot;dead ends&quot; in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals. It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea. The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was it thought that  ctenophores were a poor diet for other animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> low ratio of organic matter to salt and water</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the oncorhynchus also called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> chum salmon</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> chum salmon</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> chum salmon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do beroids typically eat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> ctenophores</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> other ctenophores</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> other ctenophores</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where have herbivorous fishes been seen feeding on gelatinous zooplankton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> the Red Sea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> the Red Sea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> blooms in the Red Sea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Turtles and jellyfish can eat large quantities of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> ctenophores,</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> ctenophores</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> ctenophores</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Mnemiopsis leidyi</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi introduced into The Black Sea and the Sea of Azov?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> via the ballast tanks of ships</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> via the ballast tanks of ships</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> the ballast tanks of ships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the population of mnemiopsis in The black Sea and the Sea of Azov brought under control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata,</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi introduced into The Black Sea and the Sea of Azov?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> in the late 1980s</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> the late 1980s</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> late 1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does cooling of the local environment affect the mnemiopsis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> significantly slowed the animal's metabolism</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> slowed the animal's metabolism</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> significantly slowed the animal's metabolism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue.

Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes.

They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary &quot;aunt&quot; of ctenophores, and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old were the fossils found in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> 515 million years</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> about 515 million years</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> 515 million years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of fossils were found in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil Stromatoveris</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Stromatoveris</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> sessile frond-like</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which genus is considered the &quot;aunt&quot; of ctenophores?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Stromatoveris</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Stromatoveris</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Stromatoveris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Stromatoveris is similair to which genus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Vendobionta</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> ctenophores</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Vendobionta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Vendobionta lived during which period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Ediacaran period</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Ediacaran period</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Ediacaran period</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead. Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Recent studies believe  that ctenophores are the sister lineage to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> all other animals</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Bilateria</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Bilateria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some researchers believe is the earliest-diverging animal phylum is?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Porifera</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Porifera</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Porifera</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which genus of ctenophores does not have cydipped-like larvae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> beroids</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> beroids</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> beroids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A molecular phylogeny analysis confirmed that cydippid are not what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> monophyletic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Cretaceous-Paleogen extinction occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> 65.5 million years ago</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> 65.5 million years ago</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> 65.5 million years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did a morphologically analysis in 1985 that concluded cydippids are not monophyletic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1:</i><span class="answer"> Richard Harbison</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2:</i><span class="answer"> Richard Harbison</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3:</i><span class="answer"> Richard Harbison</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
