<html><body><div><h1>Private_school</h1><h2>Private schools, also known as independent schools, non-governmental, or nonstate schools, are not administered by local, state or national governments; thus, they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition, rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public (government) funding; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship, which makes the cost cheaper, depending on a talent the student may have (e.g. sport scholarship, art scholarship, academic scholarship), financial need, or tax credit scholarships that might be available.</h2><h3>Along with non-governmental and nonstate schools, what is another name for private schools?</h3><p>independent</p><p>independent schools</p><p>independent schools</p><h3>Along with sport and art, what is a type of talent scholarship?</h3><p>academic</p><p>academic</p><p>academic</p><h3>Rather than taxation, what are private schools largely funded by?</h3><p>tuition</p><p>charging their students tuition</p><p>tuition</p><h3>What right do private schools have that public schools don't?</h3><p>to select their students</p><p>select their students</p><p>select their students</p><h2>In the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including Australia and Canada, the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions. Private education in North America covers the whole gamut of educational activity, ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions. Annual tuition fees at K-12 schools range from nothing at so called 'tuition-free' schools to more than $45,000 at several New England preparatory schools.</h2><h3>What is the yearly cost of some notable prep schools in New England?</h3><p>$45,000</p><p>more than $45,000</p><p>$45,000</p><h3>What are private schools that charge no tuition called?</h3><p>'tuition-free</p><p>tuition-free</p><p>tuition-free</p><h3>Along with Canada and the United Kingdom, what country generally doesn't refer to universities as private schools?</h3><p>Australia</p><p>Australia</p><p>Australia</p><h3>What region does use the term 'private schools' to refer to universities?</h3><p>North America</p><p>North America</p><p>North America</p><h2>The secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 (year twelve is known as lower sixth) and year 13 (upper sixth). This category includes university-preparatory schools or &quot;prep schools&quot;, boarding schools and day schools. Tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors, including the location of the school, the willingness of parents to pay, peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment. High tuition, schools claim, is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments, including a low student to teacher ratio, small class sizes and services, such as libraries, science laboratories and computers. Some private schools are boarding schools and many military academies are privately owned or operated as well.</h2><h3>What is another term for year 12 of education?</h3><p>lower sixth</p><p>lower sixth</p><p>lower sixth</p><h3>What is another term used for year 13?</h3><p>upper sixth</p><p>upper sixth</p><p>upper sixth</p><h3>What is another term for university-preparatory schools?</h3><p>prep schools</p><p>prep schools</p><p>prep schools</p><h3>Along with location, endowment and the willingness of parents to pay, what factor influences private school tuition?</h3><p>peer tuitions</p><p>peer tuitions</p><p>peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment</p><h3>Who receives higher salaries at private schools that charge higher tuition?</h3><p>teachers</p><p>teachers</p><p>best teachers</p><h2>Religiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private schools. Some such schools teach religious education, together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faith's beliefs and traditions in the students who attend. Others use the denomination as more of a general label to describe on what the founders based their belief, while still maintaining a fine distinction between academics and religion. They include parochial schools, a term which is often used to denote Roman Catholic schools. Other religious groups represented in the K-12 private education sector include Protestants, Jews, Muslims and the Orthodox Christians.</h2><h3>What religion's schools does the term 'parochial schools' generally refer to?</h3><p>Roman Catholic</p><p>Roman Catholic</p><h3>Along with Muslims, Jews and Protestant Christians, what religious group notably operates private schools?</h3><p>Orthodox Christians</p><p>Roman Catholic</p><p>Orthodox Christians</p><h3>What type of education is sometimes present at religious schools in addition to the secular curriculum?</h3><p>religious</p><p>religious</p><p>the usual academic subjects</p><h2>Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons: prestige and the social status of the 'old school tie'; better quality physical infrastructure and more facilities (e.g. playing fields, swimming pools, etc.), higher-paid teachers; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education. Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools. Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer. Private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.[citation needed]</h2><h3>What power is available to Australian private schools but generally not present in public schools?</h3><p>expulsion</p><p>expulsion</p><p>offer a higher quality of education</p><h3>What is an example of an article of uniform clothing typically present in Australian private schools?</h3><p>blazer</p><p>blazer</p><p>blazer</p><h3>What is the comparison in price between Australian private schools versus public?</h3><p>more expensive</p><p>more expensive</p><p>more expensive</p><h2>Although most are non-aligned, some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large, long-established religious foundations, such as the Anglican Church, Uniting Church and Presbyterian Church, but in most cases, they do not insist on their students’ religious allegiance. These schools are typically viewed as 'elite schools'. Many of the 'grammar schools' also fall in this category. They are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style, some Catholic schools fall into this category as well, e.g. St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, St Gregory's College, Campbelltown, St Aloysius' College (Sydney) and St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, as well as Loreto Kirribilli, Monte Sant Angelo Mercy College, St Ursula's College and Loreto Normanhurst for girls.</h2><h3>Along with the Anglican Church and Uniting Church, what religious denomination operates private schools in Australia?</h3><p>Presbyterian</p><p>Presbyterian Church</p><p>Presbyterian Church</p><h3>What denomination operates St Joseph's College?</h3><p>Catholic</p><p>Catholic</p><p>Catholic</p><h3>Where is St Aloysius' College located?</h3><p>Sydney</p><p>Sydney</p><p>Sydney</p><h3>Who attends Loreto Normanhurst?</h3><p>girls</p><p>girls</p><p>girls</p><h2>The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency. It is also not possible to abolish these rights. This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future. Still, they are less common than in many other countries. Overall, between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1% to 7.8% (including rise from 0.5% to 6.1% in the former GDR). Percent of students in private high schools reached 11.1%.</h2><h3>What article of the Grundgesetz grants the right to make private schools?</h3><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><h3>The prospect of what event compelled the protection of German private schools?</h3><p>second Gleichschaltung</p><p>a second Gleichschaltung</p><p>a second Gleichschaltung</p><h3>What percentage of German students attended private schools in 2008?</h3><p>7.8</p><p>7.8%</p><p>7.8</p><h3>What was the percentage of Germans attending private high schools in 2008?</h3><p>11.1</p><p>11.1%</p><p>11.1</p><h3>In 1992, what percentage of East German students attended private schools?</h3><p>0.5</p><p>0.5%</p><p>6.1</p><h2>Ersatzschulen are ordinary primary or secondary schools, which are run by private individuals, private organizations or religious groups. These schools offer the same types of diplomas as public schools. Ersatzschulen lack the freedom to operate completely outside of government regulation. Teachers at Ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools, an Ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz, also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents (the so-called Sonderungsverbot). Therefore, most Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships, compared to most other Western European countries. However, it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees, which is why all German Ersatzschulen are additionally financed with public funds. The percentages of public money could reach 100% of the personnel expenditures. Nevertheless, Private Schools became insolvent in the past in Germany.</h2><h3>What is the German term for segregating students based on their parents' wealth?</h3><p>Sonderungsverbot</p><p>Sonderungsverbot</p><p>Sonderungsverbot</p><h3>What do Germans call private schools?</h3><p>Ersatzschulen</p><p>Ersatzschulen</p><p>Ersatzschulen</p><h3>How does the level of tuition in German private schools compare to private schools in other Western European countries?</h3><p>very low</p><p>very low</p><p>very low tuition fees</p><h2>Ergänzungsschulen are secondary or post-secondary (non-tertiary) schools, which are run by private individuals, private organizations or rarely, religious groups and offer a type of education which is not available at public schools.

So, in a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school. For the purpose of this definition, only receipt of financial aid is considered, not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate. It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution. The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector. Among other things, this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates. Prominent Examination Boards that are present in multiple states are the CBSE and the CISCE, NENBSE</h2><h3>What is the term for an Indian private school?</h3><p>independent</p><p>independent schools</p><p>independent schools</p><h3>Along with the CISCE and NENBSE, what is a notable Examination Board in multiple Indian states?</h3><p>CBSE</p><p>CBSE</p><p>CBSE</p><h3>How many Examination Boards exist in India?</h3><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><h3>What body in India provides policy directions to schools?</h3><p>union government</p><p>the union government</p><p>union government</p><h2>Legally, only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in India. They will have to satisfy a number of infrastructure and human resource related criteria to get Recognition (a form of license) from the government. Critics of this system point out that this leads to corruption by school inspectors who check compliance and to fewer schools in a country that has the largest adult illiterate population in the world. While official data does not capture the real extent of private schooling in the country, various studies have reported unpopularity of government schools and an increasing number of private schools. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which evaluates learning levels in rural India, has been reporting poorer academic achievement in government schools than in private schools. A key difference between the government and private schools is that the medium of education in private schools is English while it is the local language in government schools.</h2><h3>Along with trusts, what other non-profits are allowed to run schools in India?</h3><p>societies</p><p>societies</p><p>societies</p><h3>What country has the most illiterate adults in the world?</h3><p>India</p><p>India</p><p>India</p><h3>What is the full name of the ASER?</h3><p>Annual Status of Education Report</p><p>Annual Status of Education Report</p><p>Annual Status of Education Report</p><h3>What is the purpose of the ASER?</h3><p>evaluates learning levels in rural India</p><p>evaluates learning levels in rural India</p><p>evaluates learning levels in rural India</p><h3>In private schools, what language are classes taught in?</h3><p>English</p><p>English</p><p>English</p><h2>In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phríobháideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State. If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year. The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order, i.e., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc.</h2><h3>What is the Irish term for private schools?</h3><p>scoil phríobháideach</p><p>scoil phríobháideach</p><p>scoil phríobháideach</p><h3>How do private schools in Ireland differ from most?</h3><p>teacher's salaries are paid by the State</p><p>a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State</p><p>certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State</p><h3>What is the typical annual cost for an Irish private school?</h3><p>€5,000</p><p>€5,000</p><p>€5,000</p><h3>Along with the Congregation of Christian Brothers, what is a notable religious group that runs fee-paying schools in Ireland?</h3><p>Society of Jesus</p><p>the Society of Jesus</p><p>Society of Jesus</p><h3>What might the fees to attend an Irish boarding school rise to?</h3><p>€25,000 per year</p><p>€25,000</p><p>€25,000 per year</p><h2>After Malaysia's independence in 1957, the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system.

The ones that accept government funds are called 'aided' schools. The private 'un-aided' schools are fully funded by private parties. The standard and the quality of education is quite high. Technically, these would be categorized as private schools, but many of them have the name &quot;Public School&quot; appended to them, e.g., the Galaxy Public School in Kathmandu. Most of the middle-class families send their children to such schools, which might be in their own city or far off, like boarding schools. The medium of education is English, but as a compulsory subject, Nepali and/or the state's official language is also taught.

Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge &quot;attendance dues&quot; for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets.</h2><h3>How many private schools existed in New Zealand in April 2014?</h3><p>88</p><p>88</p><p>88</p><h3>In April 2014, how many New Zealand students attended private schools?</h3><p>28,000</p><p>28,000</p><p>28,000</p><h3>What percentage of New Zealand students attended private schools in April 2014?</h3><p>3.7</p><p>3.7%</p><p>3.7</p><h3>What religion's schools were integrated into New Zealand public schools between 1979 and 1984?</h3><p>Catholic</p><p>Catholic</p><p>Catholic</p><h3>What city, along with Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch, is one of the largest in New Zealand?</h3><p>Auckland</p><p>Auckland</p><p>Auckland</p><h2>Private schools are often Anglican, such as King's College and Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland, St Paul's Collegiate School in Hamilton, St Peter's School in Cambridge, Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington, and Christ's College and St Margaret's College in Christchurch; or Presbyterian, such as Saint Kentigern College and St Cuthbert's College in Auckland, Scots College and Queen Margaret College in Wellington, and St Andrew's College and Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Christchurch.

Private schools have proven to be efficient in resource utilization. Per unit costs in private schools are generally lower when compared to public schools. This situation is more evident at the tertiary level. Government regulations have given private education more flexibility and autonomy in recent years, notably by lifting the moratorium on applications for new courses, new schools and conversions, by liberalizing tuition fee policy for private schools, by replacing values education for third and fourth years with English, mathematics and natural science at the option of the school, and by issuing the revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools in August 1992.</h2><h3>What percentage of Filipino primary school students are in private schools?</h3><p>7.5</p><p>7.5%</p><p>7.5</p><h3>In the Philippines, what percentage of secondary school students attend private schools?</h3><p>32</p><p>32%</p><p>32</p><h3>What percentage of Filipino tertiary education takes place in private schools?</h3><p>80</p><p>80%</p><p>80</p><h3>In what month and year was the revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools released?</h3><p>August 1992</p><p>August 1992</p><p>August 1992</p><h3>Along with English and mathematics, what subject replaced values education for fourth year students?</h3><p>natural science</p><p>natural science</p><p>English, mathematics and natural science</p><h2>The Education Service Contracting scheme of the government provides financial assistance for tuition and other school fees of students turned away from public high schools because of enrollment overflows.

According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level.[citation needed] Many independent schools are single-sex (though this is becoming less common).

Some of the most relevant Supreme Court case law on this is as follows: Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); Pierce v.

The leading schools such as the Groton School had substantial endowments running to hundreds of millions of dollars supplemented by fundraising drives. Boarding schools with a reputation for quality in the United States have a student body drawn from throughout the country, indeed the globe, and a list of applicants which far exceeds their capacity.</h2><h3>About how much did a New York City day school cost annually in 2012?</h3><p>$40,000</p><p>$40,000</p><p>$40,000</p><h3>What would a parent have to pay to send their child to a boarding school in 2012?</h3><p>$50,000</p><p>$50,000</p><p>$50,000</p><h3>What notable private school has an endowment of several hundred million dollars?</h3><p>Groton School</p><p>Groton School</p><p>Groton School</p><h3>In addition to endowments and tuition, how do boarding schools cover their operating costs?</h3><p>fundraising</p><p>fundraising drives</p><p>fundraising drives</p></div></body></html>
