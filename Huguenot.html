<html><body><div><h1>Huguenot</h1><h2>Huguenot numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562, concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France, about one-eighth the number of French Catholics. As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.</h2><h3>Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?</h3><p>the southern and central parts of France</p><p>southern and central parts of France,</p><p>about one-eighth</p><h3>What was the proportion of Huguenots to Catholics at their peak?</h3><p>about one-eighth the number</p><p>about one-eighth</p><p>about one-eighth</p><h3>When were the Wars of Religion fought?</h3><p>from 1562 to 1598</p><p>1562 to 1598</p><p>562 to 1598</p><h3>What treaty ended the Wars of Religion?</h3><p>the Edict of Nantes</p><p>Edict of Nantes</p><p>the Edict of Nantes</p><h3>What did this agreement do?</h3><p>granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy</p><p>granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy</p><p>granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy</p><h2>A term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in &quot;a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy&quot;). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the &quot;Confederate Party&quot;, so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]</h2><h3>The term Huguenot was originally meant to confer?</h3><p>derision</p><p>derision</p><p>derision</p><h3>What Swiss city was the center of the Calvinist movement?</h3><p>Geneva</p><p>Geneva</p><p>Geneva</p><h3>The term may be related to what politician from Switzerland?</h3><p>Besançon Hugues</p><p>Besançon Hugues</p><p>Besançon Hugues</p><h3>What name was given to the plot to usurp power from the French House of Guise?</h3><p>Amboise plot</p><p>Amboise</p><p>the Amboise plot</p><h3>When did this attempt take place?</h3><p>1560</p><p>1560</p><p>1560</p><h2>The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France. The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the Protestant Reformation finally arrived. Around 1294, a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest, Guyard de Moulin. A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by Jean de Rély, was printed in Paris in 1487.</h2><h3>What helped spread Protestantism in France?</h3><p>availability of the Bible in vernacular languages</p><p>the Bible in vernacular languages</p><p>The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages</p><h3>When did the first French language bible appear?</h3><p>Around 1294</p><p>1294</p><p>Around 1294</p><h3>Who translated this version of the scriptures?</h3><p>Guyard de Moulin</p><p>Guyard de Moulin</p><p>Guyard de Moulin</p><h3>An illustrated, paraphrased version of this appeared when?</h3><p>1487</p><p>1487</p><p>1487</p><h3>Jean De Rely's illustrated French-language scriptures were first published in what city?</h3><p>Paris</p><p>Paris</p><p>Paris</p><h2>Montpellier was among the most important of the 66 &quot;villes de sûreté&quot; that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots. The city's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots. Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622. Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city's fortifications. A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party. Even before the Edict of Alès (1629), Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more.[citation needed]</h2><h3>What were the towns granted to the Huguenots in 1598 collectively called?</h3><p>villes de sûreté</p><p>&quot;villes de sûreté&quot;</p><p>villes de sûreté</p><h3>What was the most important of these cities or towns?</h3><p>Montpellier</p><p>Montpellier</p><p>Montpellier</p><h3>What proclamation officially ended limited Huguenot autonomy?</h3><p>Edict of Alès</p><p>Edict of Alès</p><p>Edict of Alès</p><h3>France laid siege to Montpellier in what year?</h3><p>1622</p><p>1622</p><p>1622</p><h3>When was this proclamation issued?</h3><p>1629</p><p>1629</p><p>1629</p><h2>Individual Huguenots settled at the Cape of Good Hope from as early as 1671 with the arrival of François Villion (Viljoen). The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however Maria de la Queillerie, wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck (and daughter of a Walloon church minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town. The couple left for the Far East ten years later. On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope. The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.</h2><h3>Where did the first Huguenot colonists settle?</h3><p>at the Cape of Good Hope</p><p>Cape of Good Hope</p><p>the Cape of Good Hope</p><h3>What modern city is located on the original Huguenot colony?</h3><p>Cape Town</p><p>Cape Town</p><p>Cape Town</p><h3>Who was the first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope?</h3><p>Maria de la Queillerie</p><p>Maria de la Queillerie</p><p>Maria de la Queillerie</p><h3>What trading company helped settle Huguenots near the Cape?</h3><p>Dutch East India Company</p><p>Dutch East India Company</p><p>Dutch East India Company</p><h3>The number of new Huguenot colonists declined after what year?</h3><p>1700</p><p>1700</p><p>1700</p><h2>Barred by the government from settling in New France, Huguenots led by Jessé de Forest, sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including Nova Scotia. A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick.</h2><h3>When did Huguenots colonize in North America?</h3><p>1624</p><p>1624</p><p>1624</p><h3>Who led the North American Huguenot colonial expedition?</h3><p>Jessé de Forest</p><p>Jessé de Forest</p><p>Jessé de Forest</p><h3>What was the name of the first Huguenot church in the New World?</h3><p>L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam</p><p>L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam</p><p>L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam)</p><h3>By what name is that first Huguenot church known today?</h3><p>L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit</p><p>L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit</p><p>L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit</p><h3>The Huguenots were the first Europeans to live in what modern New York borough?</h3><p>Brooklyn</p><p>Brooklyn</p><p>Brooklyn</p><h2>In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.</h2><h3>Where in South Carolina did Huguenot nobility settle?</h3><p>the Charleston Orange district</p><p>Charleston Orange district</p><p>Charleston Orange district</p><h3>From whom did the Huguenots in South Carolina purchase land from?</h3><p>the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger</p><p>Edmund Bellinger</p><p>Edmund Bellinger</p><h3>Charleston settler Elie Prioleau was from what French town?</h3><p>Pons</p><p>Pons in France</p><p>Pons</p><h3>When did the Huguenots secure the right to own land in the Baronies?</h3><p>1697</p><p>1697</p><p>1697</p><h3>What southern city did the Huguenots settle near?</h3><p>Charleston, South Carolina</p><p>Charleston</p><p>Charleston, South Carolina</p><h2>Stadtholder William III of Orange, who later became King of England, emerged as the strongest opponent of king Louis XIV after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672. William formed the League of Augsburg as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state. Consequently, many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist Dutch Republic, which led the opposition to Louis XIV, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there.</h2><h3>Who was Louis XIV's main rival?</h3><p>William III of Orange</p><p>Stadtholder William III of Orange</p><p>Stadtholder William III of Orange</p><h3>William would eventually gain what throne?</h3><p>King of England</p><p>King of England</p><p>King of England</p><h3>What coalition rose up to oppose Louis XIV's France?</h3><p>League of Augsburg</p><p>League of Augsburg</p><p>League of Augsburg</p><h3>With what European country did the Huguenots feel kinship for emigration to?</h3><p>Dutch Republic</p><p>Dutch Republic</p><p>Dutch Republic</p><h3>When did France and the Dutch fight in the 17th century?</h3><p>1672</p><p>1672</p><p>1672</p><h2>Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat. They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France, and forced the Huguenots to convert. While nearly three-quarters eventually were killed  or submitted, roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France by the early 18th century[citation needed].</h2><h3>What proclamation abolished protestantism in France?</h3><p>Edict of Fontainebleau</p><p>Edict of Fontainebleau</p><p>the Edict of Fontainebleau</p><h3>When was this edict declared?</h3><p>1685</p><p>1685</p><p>1685</p><h3>Which French kind issued this declaration?</h3><p>Louis XIV</p><p>Louis XIV</p><p>Louis XIV</p><h3>How many Huguenots fled France by the 1700s?</h3><p>500,000</p><p>500,000</p><p>roughly 500,000</p><h2>The Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots. Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship. The height of this persecution was the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed, although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern France.

A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629. revolted against royal authority. The uprising occurred a decade following the death of Henry IV, a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism, who had protected Protestants through the Edict of Nantes. His successor Louis XIII, under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de' Medici, became more intolerant of Protestantism. The Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power. The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French Crown.[citation needed]</h2><h3>When did these rebellions take place?</h3><p>between 1621 and 1629</p><p>between 1621 and 1629</p><p>between 1621 and 1629</p><h3>Where did these uprisings take place?</h3><p>southwestern France</p><p>southwestern France</p><p>mainly in southwestern France</p><h3>What King and former Huguenot looked out for the welfare of the group?</h3><p>Henry IV</p><p>Henry IV</p><p>Henry IV</p><h3>Which successor to Henry resumed persecution of the Huguenots?</h3><p>Louis XIII</p><p>Louis XIII</p><p>Louis XIII</p><h3>What were the civil wars caused by the Huguenots called?</h3><p>Huguenot rebellions</p><p>Huguenot rebellions</p><p>the Huguenot rebellions</p><h2>Approximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2% of its population. Most are concentrated in Alsace in northeast France and the Cévennes mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day.[citation needed] A diaspora of French Australians still considers itself Huguenot, even after centuries of exile. Long integrated into Australian society, it is encouraged by the Huguenot Society of Australia to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage, aided by the Society's genealogical research services.</h2><h3>How many protestants live in France today?</h3><p>one million</p><p>Approximately one million</p><p>Approximately one million</p><h3>What percentage of France's population is protestant today?</h3><p>2%</p><p>2%</p><p>2%</p><h3>What northern province in France has a large protestant population?</h3><p>Alsace</p><p>Alsace</p><p>Alsace</p><h3>What is the southern region where protestants are concentrated?</h3><p>Cévennes</p><p>Cévennes</p><p>Cévennes mountain region</p><h3>What country currently has a group who call themselves Huguenots?</h3><p>Australia</p><p>Australia</p><p>Australia</p><h2>Huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country, but rather, formed three societies or congregations; one in the city of New York, another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named New Rochelle, and a third further upstate in New Paltz. The &quot;Huguenot Street Historic District&quot; in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains the oldest street in the United States of America.

Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Cévennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Lozère. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.

It was in this place in Tours that the prétendus réformés (&quot;these supposedly 'reformed'&quot;) habitually gathered at night, both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing psalms. Such explanations have been traced to the contemporary, Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560), who in De l'Estat de France offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by The Cape Monthly:</h2><h3>Where was the Gate of King Hugo?</h3><p>Tours</p><p>Tours</p><p>Tours</p><h3>By what other name was the Gate known?</h3><p>Huguon</p><p>Huguon</p><p>Huguon</p><h3>Who allegedly haunted the gate?</h3><p>the ghost of le roi Huguet</p><p>ghost of le roi Huguet</p><p>the ghost of le roi Huguet</p><h3>By what name were the &quot;supposedly reformed&quot; known?</h3><p>prétendus réformés</p><p>prétendus réformés</p><p>prétendus réformés</p><h3>What time of day did these reformed supposedly gather to engage in Huguenot rituals?</h3><p>night</p><p>night</p><p>at night</p><h2>Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where weavers' windows survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers. The Weavers, a half-timbered house by the river, was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Others refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the City. They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.</h2><h3>Where did Huguenots and Walloons settle in England?</h3><p>Canterbury</p><p>Canterbury</p><p>Canterbury</p><h3>What house was the site of a weaving school in Canterbury?</h3><p>The Weavers</p><p>The Weavers</p><p>The Weavers</p><h3>What social construct did Huguenot refugees in Canterbury practice?</h3><p>economic separation</p><p>economic separation</p><p>worked as weavers</p><h3>What other English towns were sites of Huguenot settlement?</h3><p>Kent, particularly Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone</p><p>Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone</p><p>Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone</p><h3>What is located on the site of The Weaving House currently?</h3><p>a restaurant</p><p>restaurant</p><p>a restaurant</p><h2>A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries. Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use, and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there. Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in Cork City; and D'Olier Street in Dublin, named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland. A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696, and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town. At the time, they constituted the majority of the townspeople.</h2><h3>French Church Street is in what Irish town?</h3><p>Cork City</p><p>Cork City</p><p>Cork City</p><h3>What Irish cities had Huguenot mayors in the 1600s and 1700s?</h3><p>Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford</p><p>Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford</p><p>Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford</p><h3>Where is D'Olier Street?</h3><p>Dublin</p><p>Dublin</p><p>Dublin</p><h3>D'Olier Street is named after whom?</h3><p>a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland</p><p>High Sheriff</p><p>a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland</p><h3>The French church in Portarlington was built when?</h3><p>1696</p><p>1696</p><p>1696</p><h2>The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as many Huguenots had occupied important places in society. The kingdom did not fully recover for years. The French crown's refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in New France may help to explain that colony's slow rate of population growth compared to that of the neighbouring British colonies, which opened settlement to religious dissenters. By the time of the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War), a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies, and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759-60.</h2><h3>What is the common term for the loss of key members of French society to Huguenot emigration?</h3><p>brain drain</p><p>brain drain</p><p>brain drain</p><h3>What was the name of France's primary colony in the New World?</h3><p>New France</p><p>New France</p><p>New France</p><h3>What persons were not allowed to settle in New France?</h3><p>non-Catholics</p><p>non-Catholics</p><p>non-Catholics</p><h3>The French and Indian War was the New World aspect of what European conflict?</h3><p>Seven Years' War</p><p>Seven Years' War</p><p>Seven Years' War</p><h3>When did the British defeat New France?</h3><p>1759-60</p><p>1759-60</p><p>1759-60</p><h2>The pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter-century. The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, having succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV, and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism, issued the Edict of Nantes. The Edict reaffirmed Catholicism as the state religion of France, but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains.

Four thousand emigrated to the North American colonies, where they settled in New York and Virginia, especially.

A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day Rio de Janeiro, and settled in a small island. A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence.

Although 19th century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry, this is contentious. The only reference to immigrant lacemakers in this period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover, and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire. The implication that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a &quot;combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground&quot;, is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe.</h2><h3>What industry was centered in Bedfordshire?</h3><p>lace</p><p>lace</p><p>British lace</p><h3>What style of lace is erroneously believed by some to have Huguenot influence?</h3><p>'Bucks Point'</p><p>Bucks Point</p><p>Bucks Point</p><h3>What reference is there to Huguenot lacemakers in the 19th century?</h3><p>twenty-five widows who settled in Dover</p><p>twenty-five widows who settled in Dover</p><p>twenty-five widows who settled in Dover</p><h3>When did Mechlin lace develop?</h3><p>first half of the eighteenth century</p><p>first half of the eighteenth century</p><p>first half of the eighteenth century</p><h2>In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt.

They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07. Many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence.

Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged Cévennes region in the south. In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the Camisards who were Huguenots rioted against the Catholic Church in the region, burning churches and killing clergy.

The effort was the first at any permanent European settlement in the present-day continental United States, but survived only a short time. A September 1565 French naval attack against the new Spanish colony at St. Augustine failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the Spanish encampment at Fort Matanzas. Hundreds of French soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez.

In 1562, naval officer Jean Ribault led an expedition that explored Florida and the present-day Southeastern U.S., and founded the outpost of Charlesfort on Parris Island, South Carolina. The Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned. In 1564, Ribault's former lieutenant René Goulaine de Laudonnière launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. War at home again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled. In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to La Florida, and sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, who established the settlement of St. Augustine near Fort Caroline.

Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbors. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honor, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.</h2><h3>In what English colony were Huguenot settlers promised land?</h3><p>Virginia</p><p>Virginia</p><p>Virginia</p><h3>In what area of this British colony were Huguenot land grants?</h3><p>Lower Norfolk County</p><p>Lower Norfolk County</p><p>Lower Norfolk County</p><h3>What town was actually granted to the Huguenots on arrival?</h3><p>Manakin Town</p><p>Manakin Town</p><p>Manakin Town</p><h3>How many settlers original settled in Manakintown?</h3><p>390</p><p>390</p><p>390</p><h3>When were these settlers naturalized as English colonists?</h3><p>12 May 1705</p><p>1705</p><p>12 May 1705</p><h2>Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the Dutch Revolt (1568–1609). The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the &quot;Apologie&quot; of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies. They settled at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and New Netherland in North America.</h2><h3>When was the Dutch Revolt?</h3><p>1568–1609</p><p>1568–1609</p><p>1568–1609</p><h3>Who did the Dutch fight in the Dutch Revolt?</h3><p>Spain</p><p>Spain</p><p>Spain</p><h3>What Dutch document condemned the Spanish Inquisition?</h3><p>&quot;Apologie&quot;</p><p>Apologie&quot; of William the Silent</p><p>Apologie</p><h3>What leader led the Dutch Revolt and wrote Apologie?</h3><p>William the Silent</p><p>Pierre L'Oyseleur</p><p>William the Silent</p><h3>What was the Dutch leader's religious affiliation?</h3><p>Calvinist</p><p>Calvinist</p><p>Walloon</p><h2>Both before and after the 1708 passage of the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act, an estimated 50,000 Protestant Walloons and Huguenots fled to England, with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere.

During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence.

Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron Saint Nicolas, similar to the Dutch Sint Nicolaas (Sinterklaas) feast.</h2><h3>Who was a prominent Huguenot in Holland?</h3><p>Pierre Bayle</p><p>Pierre Bayle</p><p>Pierre Bayle</p><h3>Where did he begin teaching?</h3><p>Rotterdam</p><p>Rotterdam</p><p>Rotterdam</p><h3>What books did Bayle publish?</h3><p>Historical and Critical Dictionary</p><p>Historical and Critical Dictionary</p><p>Historical and Critical Dictionary</p><h3>These books became a foundational text for what library?</h3><p>US Library of Congress</p><p>US Library of Congress</p><p>US Library of Congress</p><h3>Who is the patron saint of the Huguenots?</h3><p>Saint Nicolas</p><p>Saint Nicolas</p><p>Saint Nicolas</p><h2>The French Protestant Church of London was established by Royal Charter in 1550. It is now located at Soho Square. Huguenot refugees flocked to Shoreditch, London. They established a major weaving industry in and around Spitalfields (see Petticoat Lane and the Tenterground) in East London. In Wandsworth, their gardening skills benefited the Battersea market gardens. The Old Truman Brewery, then known as the Black Eagle Brewery, was founded in 1724. The flight of Huguenot refugees from Tours, France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built.[citation needed] Some of these immigrants moved to Norwich, which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers. The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.</h2><h3>What early Huguenot Church was established in England?</h3><p>The French Protestant Church of London</p><p>The French Protestant Church of London</p><p>The French Protestant Church of London</p><h3>When was the charter for this church signed?</h3><p>1550</p><p>1550</p><p>1550</p><h3>What is the present-day location of this church?</h3><p>Soho Square</p><p>Soho Square</p><p>Soho Square</p><h3>What London neighborhood attracted Huguenot refugees?</h3><p>Shoreditch</p><p>Shoreditch</p><p>Shoreditch</p><h3>When was the Old Truman Brewery founded?</h3><p>1724</p><p>1724</p><p>1724</p><h2>Around 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in Brandenburg-Prussia, where they were granted special privileges (Edict of Potsdam) and churches in which to worship (such as the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde) by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia. The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich). Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of Baden, Franconia (Principality of Bayreuth, Principality of Ansbach), Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, Duchy of Württemberg, in the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, in the Palatinate and Palatinate-Zweibrücken, in the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt), in modern-day Saarland; and 1,500 found refuge in Hamburg, Bremen and Lower Saxony. Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Celle.</h2><h3>What protestant religions made Northern European counties safe for Huguenot immigration?</h3><p>Lutheran and Reformed</p><p>Lutheran and Reformed</p><p>Lutheran and Reformed</p><h3>Which areas of Northern Europe practiced those religions?</h3><p>Germany and Scandinavia</p><p>Germany and Scandinavia</p><p>Germany and Scandinavia</p><h3>What proclamation gave Huguenots special privileges in Brandenburg?</h3><p>Edict of Potsdam</p><p>Edict of Potsdam</p><p>Edict of Potsdam</p><h3>What dual titles did Frederick William hold?</h3><p>Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia</p><p>Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia</p><p>Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia</p><h3>What military impact did Huguenot immigration have on Frederick's army?</h3><p>Huguenots furnished two new regiments</p><p>two new regiments</p><p>furnished two new regiments of his army</p><h2>Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, invited Huguenots to settle in his realms, and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia.
