<html><body><div><h1>Islamism</h1><h2>Islamism, also known as Political Islam (Arabic: إسلام سياسي‎ islām siyāsī), is an Islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt &quot;to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life.&quot; Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a. The different Islamist movements have been described as &quot;oscillating between two poles&quot;: at one end is a strategy of Islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion; at the other &quot;reformist&quot; pole Islamists work to Islamize society gradually &quot;from the bottom up&quot;. The movements have &quot;arguably altered the Middle East more than any trend since the modern states gained independence&quot;, redefining &quot;politics and even borders&quot; according to one journalist (Robin Wright).</h2><h3>What is an Islamic revival movement?</h3><p>Islamism</p><p>Islamism</p><p>Islamism</p><h3>What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?</h3><p>all spheres of life.</p><p>all spheres of life</p><p>all spheres</p><h3>What goal does Islamism have when it comes to society and government?</h3><p>reordering</p><p>reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a</p><p>reordering</p><h3>What have the two different Islamist movements been described as oscillating between?</h3><p>poles</p><p>two poles</p><p>poles</p><h3>One strategy of Islamization is to seize power by what methods?</h3><p>revolution or invasion</p><p>revolution or invasion</p><p>revolution</p><h2>Moderate and reformist Islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the Tunisian Ennahda Movement. Jamaat-e-Islami of Pakistan is basically a socio-political and democratic Vanguard party but has also gained political influence through military coup d'état in past. The Islamist groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine participate in democratic and political process as well as armed attacks, seeking to abolish the state of Israel. Radical Islamist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and groups such as the Taliban, entirely reject democracy, often declaring as kuffar those Muslims who support it (see takfirism), as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis.</h2><h3>What process do moderate and reformist Islamists work within the boundaries of?</h3><p>democratic</p><p>democratic process</p><p>democratic</p><h3>Where does Hamas originate?</h3><p>Palestine</p><p>Palestine</p><p>Palestine</p><h3>What is the goal of Islamist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas?</h3><p>abolish the state of Israel</p><p>abolish the state of Israel</p><p>abolish the state of Israel</p><h3>What do radical Islamist organizations reject entirely?</h3><p>democracy</p><p>democracy</p><p>democracy</p><h3>On what basis do the radical Islamist organizations conduct their attacks?</h3><p>religious</p><p>religious</p><p>religious</p><h2>Another major division within Islamism is between what Graham E. Fuller has described as the fundamentalist &quot;guardians of the tradition&quot; (Salafis, such as those in the Wahhabi movement) and the &quot;vanguard of change and Islamic reform&quot; centered around the Muslim Brotherhood. Olivier Roy argues that &quot;Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century&quot; when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on &quot;sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions,&quot; and rejection of Shia Islam. Following the Arab Spring, Roy has described Islamism as &quot;increasingly interdependent&quot; with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world, such that &quot;neither can now survive without the other.&quot; While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy. At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.</h2><h3>What exists between fundamentalist Islamism and reformist Islamism?</h3><p>major division</p><p>major division</p><p>division</p><h3>What did Olivier Roy state underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century?</h3><p>Sunni pan-Islamism</p><p>Sunni pan-Islamism</p><p>Sunni pan-Islamism</p><h3>What did the Salafi movement put emphasis on?</h3><p>sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions,</p><p>sharia</p><p>sharia</p><h3>What has Islamism been increasingly interdependent with following the Arab Spring?</h3><p>democracy</p><p>democracy</p><p>democracy</p><h3>Why do Islamists need democratic elections?</h3><p>to maintain their legitimacy</p><p>to maintain their legitimacy</p><p>to maintain their legitimacy</p><h2>Islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for Islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect Islam, while the contrary idea that Islam is, or can be, apolitical is an error. Scholars and observers who do not believe that Islam is merely a political ideology include Fred Halliday, John Esposito and Muslim intellectuals like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi. Hayri Abaza argues the failure to distinguish between Islam and Islamism leads many in the West to support illiberal Islamic regimes, to the detriment of progressive moderates who seek to separate religion from politics.</h2><h3>What type of role that Islamism seeks makes it a somewhat controversial concept?</h3><p>political</p><p>political</p><p>political</p><h3>What do supporters of Islamism believe their views reflect?</h3><p>Islam</p><p>Islam</p><p>Islam</p><h3>The idea that Islam can be apolitical isn't able to be embraced by whom?</h3><p>its supporters</p><p>Scholars and observers</p><p>Islamism</p><h3>What does the inability to separate Islam from Islamism lead many in the West to support?</h3><p>illiberal Islamic regimes</p><p>illiberal Islamic regimes</p><p>illiberal Islamic regimes</p><h3>What do progressive moderates of Islam seek to separate?</h3><p>religion from politics</p><p>religion from politics</p><p>religion from politics</p><h2>Islamists have asked the question, &quot;If Islam is a way of life, how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal, social, political, economic, and political spheres of life are not Muslims, but Islamists and believe in Islamism, not [just] Islam?&quot; Similarly, a writer for the International Crisis Group maintains that &quot;the conception of 'political Islam'&quot; is a creation of Americans to explain the Iranian Islamic Revolution and apolitical Islam was a historical fluke of the &quot;short-lived era of the heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970&quot;, and it is quietist/non-political Islam, not Islamism, that requires explanation.</h2><h3>What term do Islamists think should be applied to them?</h3><p>Muslims</p><p>Muslims</p><h3>What does a writer for the International Crisis Group think the concept of political Islam is a creation of?</h3><p>Americans</p><p>Americans</p><p>Americans</p><h3>What was apolitical Islam?</h3><p>a historical fluke</p><p>political Islam</p><p>historical fluke</p><h3>When was the heyday of secular Arab nationalism?</h3><p>between 1945 and 1970</p><p>between 1945 and 1970</p><p>between 1945 and 1970</p><h3>What, rather than Islamism, requires explanation?</h3><p>non-political Islam</p><p>quietist/non-political Islam</p><p>quietist/non-political Islam</p><h2>During the 1970s and sometimes later, Western and pro-Western governments often supported sometimes fledgling Islamists and Islamist groups that later came to be seen as dangerous enemies. Islamists were considered by Western governments bulwarks against—what were thought to be at the time—more dangerous leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/opposition, which Islamists were correctly seen as opposing. The US spent billions of dollars to aid the mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan enemies of the Soviet Union, and non-Afghan veterans of the war returned home with their prestige, &quot;experience, ideology, and weapons&quot;, and had considerable impact.</h2><h3>What did some of the Islamist groups supported by the West later become to be seen as?</h3><p>dangerous enemies</p><p>dangerous enemies</p><p>dangerous enemies</p><h3>When did Western governments support fledgling Islamists?</h3><p>During the 1970s</p><p>the 1970s</p><p>1970s</p><h3>What did the non-Afghan veterans returning home have in addition to their prestige?</h3><p>considerable impact</p><p>experience, ideology, and weapons</p><p>experience, ideology, and weapons</p><h3>Who did the US provide aid to, to fight against the Soviet Union?</h3><p>the mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan</p><p>mujahideen</p><p>mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan</p><h3>Western governments considered Islamists to be the lesser of two evils when compared to whom?</h3><p>leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/opposition</p><p>leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/opposition</p><p>communist</p><h3>What did the non-Afghan veterans returning home have in addition to their prestige?</h3><p>considerable impact</p><p>experience, ideology, and weapons</p><p>experience, ideology, and weapons</p><h2>Egyptian President Anwar Sadat – whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment (infitah); transferring Egypt's allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States; and making peace with Israel – released Islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists. His &quot;encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement&quot; was said to have been &quot;imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed.&quot;  This &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot; between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975 but not before Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions. Sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in Egypt in the 1990s. The French government has also been reported to have promoted Islamist preachers &quot;in the hope of channeling Muslim energies into zones of piety and charity.&quot;</h2><h3>Who is the President of Egypt?</h3><p>Anwar Sadat</p><p>Anwar Sadat</p><p>Anwar Sadat</p><h3>What relationship with Israel is Sadat for?</h3><p>peace</p><p>peace</p><h3>What was Sadat seeking by releasing Islamists from prison?</h3><p>political support</p><p>making peace with Israel</p><p>political support</p><h3>When did the so called gentlemen's agreement between Sadat and the Islamists break down?</h3><p>1975</p><p>1975</p><p>1975</p><h3>How was Sadat rewarded by the Islamists for his attempts to bring Egypt into modern times and civilization?</h3><p>assassinated</p><p>Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions</p><p>assassinated</p><h2>The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only &quot;always oppose&quot; infidels &quot;in every way,&quot; but &quot;hate them for their religion ... for Allah's sake,&quot; that democracy &quot;is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century,&quot; that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels, etc. While this effort has by no means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.</h2><h3>What type of interpretation of Islam does Salafism promote?</h3><p>conservative</p><p>strict, conservative</p><p>strict, conservative</p><h3>What does Salafism in its harshest form encourage its followers to view the religion of others with?</h3><p>hate</p><p>hate them for their religion</p><p>hate them for their religion</p><h3>Salafism posits that democracy is responsible for what type of horrible events of the 20th century?</h3><p>wars</p><p>horrible wars</p><p>all the horrible wars</p><h3>Conservative Islam classifies Muslims who follow Shia interpretation as what?</h3><p>infidels</p><p>infidels</p><p>infidels</p><h3>What interpretation of Islam is, for many of the adherents, the &quot;gold standard&quot; of their religion?</h3><p>Saudi</p><p>the Saudi-interpretation</p><p>Saudi</p><h2>Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, &quot;are well known for providing shelters, educational assistance, free or low cost medical clinics, housing assistance to students from out of town, student advisory groups, facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands, legal assistance, sports facilities, and women's groups.&quot; All this compares very favourably against incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric.</h2><h3>What type of movement is the Muslim Brotherhood?</h3><p>Islamist</p><p>Islamist</p><p>Islamist</p><h3>The Muslim Brotherhood's competence compares well against what type of local governments?</h3><p>incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful</p><p>incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful governments</p><p>incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful</p><h3>What type of assistance to out of town students is the Muslim Brotherhood known for?</h3><p>housing</p><p>shelters, educational assistance, free or low cost medical clinics, housing assistance</p><p>shelters, educational assistance, free or low cost medical clinics, housing assistance</p><h3>What are incompetent government's commitment to social justice limited to?</h3><p>rhetoric</p><p>rhetoric</p><p>rhetoric</p><h3>Why has the Muslim Brotherhood facilitated inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies?</h3><p>avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands</p><p>to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands</p><p>avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands</p><h2>While studying law and philosophy in England and Germany, Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the All India Muslim League. He came back to Lahore in 1908. While dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry, Iqbal had remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in World War I and remained in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as Muhammad Ali Johar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a critic of the mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress. Iqbal's seven English lectures were published by Oxford University press in 1934 in a book titled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.</h2><h3>What was Iqbal studying in England and Germany?</h3><p>law and philosophy</p><p>law and philosophy</p><p>law and philosophy</p><h3>What organization did Iqbal join in London?</h3><p>the All India Muslim League</p><p>All India Muslim League</p><p>All India Muslim League</p><h3>Who was Iqbal a critic of?</h3><p>the mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress</p><p>mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress</p><p>mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress</p><h3>What year did Iqbal return to Lahore?</h3><p>1908</p><p>1908</p><p>1908</p><h3>What book was Iqbal's seven English lectures published as?</h3><p>The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam</p><p>The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam</p><p>The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam</p><h2>Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, Palestine and Syria, he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences. Sir Muhammad Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in Allahabad as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his Allahabad Address on 29 December 1930, Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India. This address later inspired the Pakistan movement.</h2><h3>What did Iqbal fear would weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society?</h3><p>secularism and secular nationalism</p><p>secularism and secular nationalism</p><p>secularism</p><h3>Iqbal worried that India's mostly Hindu population would do what to Muslim heritage and culture?</h3><p>crowd out</p><p>crowd out Muslim heritage</p><p>crowd out</p><h3>When Iqbal promoted ideas of greater Islamic political unity, what did he encourage ending?</h3><p>nationalist differences</p><p>nationalist differences</p><p>nationalist differences</p><h3>When was Iqbal elected president of the Muslim League?</h3><p>1930</p><p>1930</p><p>1930</p><h3>What did Iqbal's Allahabad address inspire?</h3><p>Pakistan movement</p><p>the Pakistan movement</p><p>Pakistan movement</p><h2>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the Islamic revival in India, and then after independence from Britain, in Pakistan. Trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about Islam and Islamic law. Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972. However, Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising. His extremely influential books (translated into many languages) placed Islam in a modern context, and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer Islamists such as al-Faruqi, whose &quot;Islamization of Knowledge&quot; carried forward some of Maududi's key principles.</h2><h3>Who was an important figure in the twentieth-century Islamic revival in India?</h3><p>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi</p><p>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi</p><p>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi</p><h3>Maududi was trained as a lawyer, but chose what professional for himself instead?</h3><p>journalism</p><p>journalism</p><p>journalism</p><h3>When did Maududi found the Jamaat-e-Islami party?</h3><p>1941</p><p>1941</p><p>1941</p><h3>Where did Maududi exert the most impact?</h3><p>through his writing</p><p>writing</p><p>writing</p><h3>Where did Maududi's books place Islam?</h3><p>in a modern context</p><p>a modern context</p><p>modern context</p><h3>Who was an important early figure in the Islamic revival in India?</h3><p>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi</p><p>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi</p><p>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi</p><h3>Though trained as a lawyer, what profession did Maududi pursue instead?</h3><p>journalism</p><p>journalism</p><p>journalism</p><h3>Where did Maududi exert the most impact?</h3><p>through his writing</p><p>writing</p><p>writing</p><h3>Where did Maududi's books place Islam?</h3><p>a modern context</p><p>a modern context</p><p>modern context</p><h2>Maududi also believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia, and Islam required the establishment of an Islamic state. This state should be a &quot;theo-democracy,&quot; based on the principles of: tawhid (unity of God), risala (prophethood) and khilafa (caliphate). Although Maududi talked about Islamic revolution, by &quot;revolution&quot; he meant not the violence or populist policies of the Iranian Revolution, but the gradual changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah.</h2><h3>What did Maududi believe Muslim society could not be Islamic in the absence of?</h3><p>Sharia</p><p>Sharia</p><p>Sharia</p><h3>Maududi believed that Islam needed what to be established?</h3><p>an Islamic state</p><p>an Islamic state</p><p>an Islamic state</p><h3>What is the English translation of tawhid?</h3><p>unity of God</p><p>unity of God</p><p>unity of God</p><h3>What type of revolution did Maududi advocate?</h3><p>gradual</p><p>Islamic revolution</p><p>gradual</p><h3>By what method did Maududi want to change the hearts and minds of individuals?</h3><p>an educational process</p><p>an educational process or da'wah</p><p>educational process or da'wah</p><h2>Roughly contemporaneous with Maududi was the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Ismailiyah, Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al Banna. His was arguably the first, largest and most influential modern Islamic political/religious organization. Under the motto &quot;the Qur'an is our constitution,&quot; it sought Islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools, mosques, and workshops. Like Maududi, Al Banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on Shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion, and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the Muslim world.</h2><h3>When was the Muslim Brotherhood founded?</h3><p>1928</p><p>1928</p><p>1928</p><h3>Where was the Muslim Brotherhood founded?</h3><p>Ismailiyah, Egypt</p><p>Ismailiyah, Egypt</p><p>Egypt</p><h3>Who founded the Muslim Brotherhood?</h3><p>Hassan al Banna</p><p>Hassan al Banna</p><p>Hassan al Banna</p><h3>The motto of the Muslim Brotherhood specifies what as being their constitution?</h3><p>the Qur'an</p><p>the Qur'an</p><p>Qur'an</p><h3>What influence did Al Banna wish to eliminate from the Muslim world?</h3><p>imperialist</p><p>imperialist influence</p><p>imperialist</p><h2>Some elements of the Brotherhood, though perhaps against orders, did engage in violence against the government, and its founder Al-Banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of Egypt's premier Mahmud Fami Naqrashi three months earlier.

For many years it was described as &quot;semi-legal&quot; and was the only opposition group in Egypt able to field candidates during elections. In the Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012, the political parties identified as &quot;Islamist&quot; (the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Salafi Al-Nour Party and liberal Islamist Al-Wasat Party) won 75% of the total seats.

The defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries, was blamed on the secular Arab nationalism of the ruling regimes. A steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular, socialist and nationalist politics ensued. Ba'athism, Arab socialism, and Arab nationalism suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic Islamist movements inspired by Maududi and Sayyid Qutb gained ground.</h2><h3>What was the defeat of the Arab troops at the hand of the Israeli troops during the Six-Day War?</h3><p>quick and decisive</p><p>quick and decisive defeat</p><p>quick and decisive</p><h3>The defeat of the Arab troops in the Six-Day War constituted what for the Arab Muslim world?</h3><p>a pivotal event</p><p>a pivotal event in the Arab Muslim world</p><p>pivotal event</p><h3>Secular Arab nationalism was blamed for both the defeat of Arab troops as well as what type of stagnation?</h3><p>economic</p><p>economic stagnation</p><p>economic</p><h3>What happened to the credibility of secular politics as a result of the Six-Day War?</h3><p>A steep and steady decline</p><p>A steep and steady decline</p><p>steep and steady decline</p><h3>What gained ground when Arab nationalism suffered?</h3><p>anti-democratic Islamist movements</p><p>anti-democratic Islamist movements inspired by Maududi and Sayyid Qutb</p><p>anti-democratic Islamist movements</p><h2>The views of Ali Shariati, ideologue of the Iranian Revolution, had resemblance with Mohammad Iqbal, ideological father of the State of Pakistan, but Khomeini's beliefs is perceived to be placed somewhere between beliefs of Sunni Islamic thinkers like Mawdudi and Qutb. He believed that complete imitation of the Prophet Mohammad and his successors such as Ali for restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam, that many secular, Westernizing Muslims were actually agents of the West serving Western interests, and that the acts such as &quot;plundering&quot; of Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by the Western governments.</h2><h3>Mohammad Iqbal was what type of father to the State of Pakistan?</h3><p>ideological</p><p>ideological</p><p>ideological</p><h3>Who was the ideologue of the Iranian Revolution?</h3><p>Ali Shariati</p><p>Ali Shariati</p><p>Ali Shariati</p><h3>Where does Khomeini's beliefs fall as compared to Mawdudi and Qutb?</h3><p>somewhere between</p><p>between</p><p>somewhere between</p><h3>Who was it essential to Islam to imitate?</h3><p>the Prophet Mohammad</p><p>Prophet Mohammad and his successors</p><p>Prophet Mohammad</p><h3>What long term agenda was the acts of plundering Muslim lands by the West?</h3><p>conspiracy</p><p>Westernizing Muslims</p><p>conspiracy</p><h2>The Islamic Republic has also maintained its hold on power in Iran in spite of US economic sanctions, and has created or assisted like-minded Shia terrorist groups in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Jordan (SCIRI) and Lebanon (Hezbollah) (two Muslim countries that also have large Shiite populations).

The conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims (mujahideen) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith. Leading this pan-Islamic effort was Palestinian sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam.

Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid. But when Saddam, secularist and Ba'athist dictator of neighboring Iraq, attacked Saudi Arabia (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy.

Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced. One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in Egypt, a bloody civil war in Algeria and Osama bin Laden's terror attacks climaxing in the 9/11 attack.</h2><h3>Who did the attacks resonate most with?</h3><p>conservative Muslims</p><p>Muslims</p><p>conservative Muslims</p><h3>What did Saudi Arabia try to repress to compensate for its loss of stature? </h3><p>domestic Islamists</p><p>domestic Islamists</p><p>domestic Islamists</p><h3>Where did American troops remain stationed after Saddam's defeat?</h3><p>in the kingdom</p><p>in the kingdom</p><p>the kingdom</p><h3>Where did a bloody civil war break out?</h3><p>Algeria</p><p>Algeria</p><p>Algeria</p><h3>Who masterminded many terror attacks?</h3><p>Osama bin Laden</p><p>Osama bin Laden</p><p>Osama bin Laden</p><h2>While Qutb's ideas became increasingly radical during his imprisonment prior to his execution in 1966, the leadership of the Brotherhood, led by Hasan al-Hudaybi, remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism.

Unlike earlier anti-colonial movements the extremist group directed its attacks against what it believed were &quot;apostate&quot; leaders of Muslim states, leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies. Its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag, in which he states:</h2><h3>Who took up the path of violence?</h3><p>Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization</p><p>the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization</p><p>Egyptian Islamic Jihad</p><h3>When did the Egyptian Islamic Jihad assassinate Anwar Sadat?</h3><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><h3>Which leaders did the Islamic extremists attack?</h3><p>apostate</p><p>&quot;apostate&quot; leaders of Muslim states,</p><p>apostate</p><h3>What sin were the leaders the extremists attacked guilty of?</h3><p>promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies</p><p>held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies</p><p>secular leanings</p><h3>Who wrote a pamphlet outlining the radical ideas of the extremists?</h3><p>Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag</p><p>Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag</p><p>Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag</p><h2>Another of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group).

Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful, and the major jihadi group, Jamaa Islamiya (or al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya), renounced violence in 2003.

As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS (&quot;zeal&quot;), devoted to Jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada. The Brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab.</h2><h3>Until 1987, what stance did the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine take towards Israel?</h3><p>quiescent</p><p>quiescent</p><p>quiescent</p><h3>What organization is devoted to Jihad against Israel?</h3><p>HAMAS</p><p>HAMAS</p><p>HAMAS</p><h3>What did the Hamas charter uncompromisingly encourage?</h3><p>destruction of Israel</p><p>the destruction of Israel</p><p>destruction of Israel</p><h3>The Brotherhood's members are against consuming what beverage?</h3><p>alcohol</p><p>alcohol</p><p>alcohol</p><h3>Where does HAMAS want to establish an Islamic state?</h3><p>Palestine</p><p>Palestine</p><p>Palestine</p><h2>Hamas has continued to be a major player in Palestine.

His National Islamic Front first gained influence when strongman General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979. Turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia.

Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men.

Zia-ul-Haq was much more committed to Islamism, and &quot;Islamization&quot; or implementation of Islamic law, became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and Islamism became his &quot;official state ideology&quot;. Zia ul Haq was an admirer of Mawdudi and Mawdudi's party Jamaat-e-Islami became the &quot;regime's ideological and political arm&quot;. In Pakistan this Islamization from above was &quot;probably&quot; more complete &quot;than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan,&quot; but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing &quot;symbols&quot; rather than substance, and using Islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power. Unlike neighboring Iran, Zia-ul-Haq's policies were intended to &quot;avoid revolutionary excess&quot;, and not to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies.

In 2014, the group proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide. As of March 2015[update], it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria, and has nominal control over small areas of Libya, Nigeria and Afghanistan.
