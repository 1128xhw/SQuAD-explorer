<html><body><div><h1>American_Broadcasting_Company</h1><h2>The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) (stylized in its logo as abc since 1957) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Disney–ABC Television Group, a subsidiary of Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. The network is headquartered on Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street in Manhattan, with additional major offices and production facilities in New York City, Los Angeles and Burbank, California.</h2><h3>What company owns the American Broadcasting Company?</h3><p>The Walt Disney Company</p><p>Disney–ABC Television Group</p><p>Disney–ABC Television Group</p><h3>In what year did ABC stylize it's logo as abc?</h3><p>1957</p><p>1957</p><p>1957</p><h3>In what borough of New York City is ABC headquartered?</h3><p>Manhattan</p><p>Manhattan</p><p>Manhattan</p><h3>On what streets is the ABC headquarters located</h3><p>Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street</p><p>Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street</p><p>Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street</p><h3>Disney-ABC Television Group is a subsidiary of what division of the Walt Disney Company?</h3><p>Disney Media Networks</p><p>Disney Media Networks</p><p>Disney Media Networks</p><h2>ABC originally launched on October 12, 1943 as a radio network, separated from and serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80% interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's parent merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company.</h2><h3>When did ABC first start?</h3><p>October 12, 1943</p><p>October 12, 1943</p><p>October 12, 1943</p><h3>What kind of network was ABC when it first began?</h3><p>radio network</p><p>radio</p><p>radio network</p><h3>When did ABC first get in to television broadcasts?</h3><p>1948</p><p>1948</p><p>1948</p><h3>In the 1980s, what cable sports channel did ABC purchase?</h3><p>ESPN</p><p>ESPN</p><p>ESPN</p><h3>What company did the ABC network's parent company merge with in the 1980s?</h3><p>Capital Cities Communications</p><p>Capital Cities Communications</p><p>Capital Cities Communications</p><h2>The television network has eight owned-and-operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Most Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity to the Canada–United States border) or through a cable, satellite or IPTV provider, although most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that allow pay television providers to replace an American station's signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue.

The last was owned by electronics manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which owned two radio networks that each ran different varieties of programming, NBC Blue and NBC Red. The NBC Blue Network was created in 1927 for the primary purpose of testing new programs on markets of lesser importance than those served by NBC Red, which served the major cities, and to test drama series.</h2><h3>What company owned NBC in the 1930s?</h3><p>Radio Corporation of America</p><p>Radio Corporation of America (RCA)</p><p>Radio Corporation of America</p><h3>What two radio networks did RCA own?</h3><p>NBC Blue and NBC Red</p><p>NBC Blue and NBC Red</p><p>NBC Blue and NBC Red</p><h3>What kind of markets did NBC Red serve?</h3><p>major cities</p><p>major cities</p><p>major cities</p><h3>What kind of programs did NBC Red test?</h3><p>drama series</p><p>drama series</p><p>drama series</p><h3>Which NBC radio network was tasked with testing new programs?</h3><p>NBC Blue</p><p>NBC Blue Network</p><p>NBC Blue Network</p><h2>In 1934, Mutual filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS. In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.</h2><h3>What company filed a complaint with the FCC in 1934 concerning problems establishing new stations?</h3><p>Mutual</p><p>Mutual</p><p>Mutual filed</p><h3>In what year did the FCC begin an investigation in to the operation of radio networks in America</h3><p>1938</p><p>1938</p><p>1938</p><h3>In what year did the FCC publish it's report?</h3><p>1940</p><p>1940</p><p>1940</p><h3>What was the main radio network in the 1940s in America?</h3><p>NBC Red Network</p><p>NBC Red Network</p><p>NBC Red Network</p><h3>What radio network was RCA using to eliminate competition in 1940?</h3><p>NBC Blue</p><p>NBC Blue</p><p>NBC Blue</p><h2>Once Mutual's appeals against the FCC were rejected, RCA decided to sell NBC Blue in 1941, and gave the mandate to do so to Mark Woods. RCA converted the NBC Blue Network into an independent subsidiary, formally divorcing the operations of NBC Red and NBC Blue on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either &quot;Blue&quot; or &quot;Blue Network&quot;. The newly separated NBC Red and NBC Blue divided their respective corporate assets. Between 1942 and 1943, Woods offered to sell the entire NBC Blue Network, a package that included leases on landlines, three pending television licenses (WJZ-TV in New York City, KGO-TV in San Francisco and WENR-TV in Chicago), 60 affiliates, four operations facilities (in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.), contracts with actors, and the brand associated with the Blue Network. Investment firm Dillon, Read &amp; Co. (which was later acquired by the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1997) offered $7.5 million to purchase the network, but the offer was rejected by Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.</h2><h3>To whom did RCA mandate the sale of NBC blue to in 1941?</h3><p>Mark Woods</p><p>Mark Woods</p><p>Mark Woods</p><h3>What network was converted into an independent subsidiary by RCA in 1942?</h3><p>NBC Blue Network</p><p>NBC Blue Network</p><p>NBC Blue Network</p><h3>What investment firm offered to buy the NBC Blue network from Mark Woods?</h3><p>Dillon, Read &amp; Co.</p><p>Dillon, Read &amp; Co</p><p>Dillon, Read &amp; Co.</p><h3>Who was RCA president in 1942?</h3><p>David Sarnoff</p><p>David Sarnoff</p><p>David Sarnoff</p><h3>How much money did Dillon, Read &amp; Co offer Mark Woods for NBC Blue?</h3><p>$7.5 million</p><p>$7.5 million</p><p>$7.5 million</p><h2>Edward John Noble, the owner of Life Savers candy, drugstore chain Rexall and New York City radio station WMCA, purchased the network for $8 million. Due to FCC ownership rules, the transaction, which was to include the purchase of three RCA stations by Noble, would require him to resell his station with the FCC's approval. The Commission authorized the transaction on October 12, 1943. Soon afterward, the Blue Network was purchased by the new company Noble founded, the American Broadcasting System. Noble subsequently acquired the rights to the &quot;American Broadcasting Company&quot; name from George B. Storer in 1944; its parent company adopted the corporate name American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. Woods retained his position as president and CEO of ABC until December 1949, and was subsequently promoted to vice-chairman of the board before leaving ABC altogether on June 30, 1951.</h2><h3>What candy company did Edward John Noble own?</h3><p>Life Savers candy</p><p>Life Savers</p><p>Life Savers</p><h3>When was the sale of NBC Blue to Edward John Noble authorized?</h3><p>October 12, 1943</p><p>October 12, 1943</p><p>October 12, 1943</p><h3>Who did Noble acquire the rights to the American Broadcasting Company name from?</h3><p>George B.

The network also became known for such suspenseful dramas as Sherlock Holmes, Gang Busters and Counterspy, as well as several mid-afternoon youth-oriented programs. However, ABC made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming, with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of NBC and CBS, adopting the use of the Magnetophon tape recorder, brought to the U.S. from Nazi Germany after its conquest, to pre-record its programming. With the help of the Magnetophon, ABC was able to provide its stars with greater freedom in terms of time, and also attract several big names, such as Bing Crosby at a time when NBC and CBS did not allow pre-taped shows.</h2><h3>What new technology allowed ABC to pre-record its shows?</h3><p>Magnetophon tape recorder</p><p>Magnetophon</p><p>Magnetophon tape recorder</p><h3>ABC aired symphony performances by what conductor?</h3><p>Paul Whiteman</p><p>Paul Whiteman</p><p>Paul Whiteman</p><h3>What network was known for dramas such as Sherlock Holmes?</h3><p>ABC</p><p>ABC</p><p>NBC Blue</p><h3>Who was a big star that ABC was able to attract because of Magnetophon technology?</h3><p>Bing Crosby</p><p>Bing Crosby</p><p>Bing Crosby</p><h3>ABC continued NBC Blue's tradition of what?</h3><p>public service</p><p>public service</p><p>public service</p><h2>A second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks (which included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney and Jetix; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000). In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group. However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced that it would discontinue ABC1 citing to the channel's inability to attain sustainable viewership. With ABC1's shutdown that October, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.</h2><h3>How much did Disney sell it's stake in Eurosport for in 2000?</h3><p>$155 million</p><p>$155 million</p><p>$155 million</p><h3>What network was launched by ABC in 2004?</h3><p>ABC1</p><p>ABC1</p><p>ABC1</p><h3>When was ABC1 discontinued because of low viewership?</h3><p>September 8, 2007</p><p>September 8, 2007</p><p>September 8, 2007</p><h3>What developmental network was discontinued after the shutdown of ABC1?</h3><p>ABC International</p><p>ABC International</p><p>ABC International</p><h3>What country is ABC broadcast in, in contrast to Disney's other channels?</h3><p>United States</p><p>United States</p><p>United States</p><h2>The idea was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels, and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC. The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries; many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.</h2><h3>When did ABC Films begin selling programs to other networks?</h3><p>1959</p><p>1959</p><p>1959</p><h3>What ended the need for ABC to maintain interests in other countries?</h3><p>satellite television</p><p>The arrival of satellite television</p><p>satellite television</p><h3>Where were ABC's international networks mainly situated in the 1970s?</h3><p>Japan and Latin America</p><p>Japan and Latin America</p><p>Japan and Latin America</p><h3>Why was ABC forced to sell its interests in international networks in the 70s?</h3><p>legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties</p><p>legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties</p><p>governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation</p><h2>The first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network date back to the 1950s, after Leonard Goldenson, following the United Paramount Theatres model, tried to use on ABC the same strategies he had made in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market. Leonard Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953; CBS and NBC were unable to cover the coronation live due to respective issues with technical problems and flight delays. NBC's plane landed in Latin America[where?], leading ABC to learn of subsidiaries in that region. Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering Central America. Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s, acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the Mainichi Broadcasting System in 1951 and Nihon Educational Television in 1957. Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in Beirut in the mid-1960s.</h2><h3>What was the first international event broadcast by ABC?</h3><p>coronation of Queen Elizabeth II</p><p>the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II</p><p>the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II</p><h3>What country did ABC expand in to in the mid-1960s?</h3><p>Beirut</p><p>Beirut</p><p>Beirut</p><h3>What Japanese network did ABC purchase a stake in in 1951?</h3><p>Mainichi Broadcasting System</p><p>Mainichi Broadcasting System</p><p>Mainichi Broadcasting System</p><h3>Why was NBC unable to broadcast the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II?</h3><p>flight delays</p><p>technical problems and flight delays</p><p>technical problems and flight delays</p><h3>Why was CBS unable to broadcast the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II?</h3><p>technical problems</p><p>technical problems and flight delays</p><p>technical problems and flight delays</p><h2>ABC currently holds the broadcast rights to the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards (which are rotated across all four major networks on a year-to-year basis), American Music Awards, Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade, Tournament of Roses Parade, Country Music Association Awards and the CMA Music Festival. Since 2000, ABC has also owned the television rights to most of the Peanuts television specials, having acquired the broadcast rights from CBS, which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of A Charlie Brown Christmas (other Peanuts specials broadcast annually by ABC, including A Charlie Brown Christmas, include It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving).</h2><h3>What television specials did ABC acquire the rights to in 2000?</h3><p>Peanuts</p><p>Peanuts</p><p>Peanuts</p><h3>Which awards show has its rights rotated among the four major networks on a yearly basis?</h3><p>Emmy Awards</p><p>Emmy Awards</p><p>Emmy Awards</p><h3>When did a Charlie Brown Christmas debut?</h3><p>1965</p><p>1965</p><p>1965</p><h3>What movie awards show does ABC currently hold the rights to?</h3><p>the Academy Awards</p><p>Academy Awards</p><p>Academy Awards, Emmy Awards</p><h3>What Peanuts special is Halloween-themed?</h3><p>It's the Great Pumpkin</p><p>It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</p><p>It's the Great Pumpkin</p><h2>Since 1974, ABC has generally aired Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on New Year's Eve (hosted first by its creator Dick Clark, and later by his successor Ryan Seacrest); the only exception was in 1999, when ABC put it on a one-year hiatus to provide coverage of the international millennium festivities, though Clark's traditional countdown from Times Square was still featured within the coverage. ABC has also aired the Miss America pageant from 1954 to 1956, 1997 to 2005 (with the television rights being assumed by cable channel TLC in 2006, when the pageant moved from its longtime homebase in Atlantic City to Las Vegas, before returning to Atlantic City in 2013) and since 2011.

ABC also broadcasts the morning news program Good Morning America and has done so since 1975, though that program is not considered to be part of the ABC Daytime block. In addition to the long-running All My Children (1970–2011) and One Life to Live (1968–2012), notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include Ryan's Hope, Dark Shadows, Loving, The City and Port Charles. ABC also aired the last nine years of the Procter &amp; Gamble-produced soap The Edge of Night, following its cancellation by CBS in 1975. ABC Daytime has also aired a number of game shows, including The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, Let's Make a Deal, Password, Split Second, The $10,000/$20,000 Pyramid, Family Feud, The Better Sex, Trivia Trap, All-Star Blitz and Hot Streak.</h2><h3>What series is the longest running program in ABC history?</h3><p>General Hospital</p><p>General Hospital</p><p>General Hospital</p><h3>When did Good Morning America begin airing?</h3><p>1975</p><p>1975</p><p>1975</p><h3>Which Proctor and Gamble produced soap opera did ABC air?</h3><p>The Edge of Night</p><p>The Edge of Night</p><p>The Edge of Night</p><h3>What are ABC's current daytime talk shows?</h3><p>The View and The Chew</p><p>The View and The Chew</p><p>The View and The Chew</p><h3>When did General Hospital begin airing?</h3><p>1963</p><p>1963</p><p>1963</p><h2>Sports programming is also provided on some weekend afternoons at any time from 12:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Pacific) and, during college football season, during prime time on Saturday nights as part of the Saturday Night Football package. Due to the erratic and (outside of college football season) highly inconsistent scheduling of sports programming on weekend afternoons since ESPN took over responsibilities for ABC's sports division in 2006, ABC carries the ESPN Sports Saturday block on Saturday late afternoons (featuring various ESPN-produced documentaries), and on Sundays either encores of primetime reality series, cancelled series being burned off that had no room on the primetime schedule, occasional theatrical films which were acquired by the network in the early to mid-2000s that no longer have a primetime slot to air in or more recently, figure skating and gymnastics specials supplied by Disson Skating, when no sports telecasts are scheduled, usually airing between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. During the summer, ABC airs ESPN-produced highlight compilation programs for The Open Championship golf and The Wimbledon tennis tournaments to provide some presence for both events on American broadcast television. ABC also carries various X Games weekend events not broadcast by ESPN. ABC airs NBA games on Sundays, normally starting in January as &quot;NBA Sunday Showcase&quot; during the regular season, and shows Christmas Day games, regularly between 2–7 PM ET, and NBA playoff games during the weekends, and exclusive rights to the NBA Finals.</h2><h3>ABC carries weekend events for what extreme sports competition?</h3><p>X Games</p><p>X Games</p><p>X Games</p><h3>When did ESPN take over responsibility for ABC's sports division?</h3><p>2006</p><p>2006</p><p>2006</p><h3>When is sports programming provided by ABC on Saturday afternoons?</h3><p>12:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time</p><p>late afternoons</p><p>Saturday Night Football</p><h3>For what league does ABC broadcast games on Christmas day?</h3><p>NBA</p><p>NBA</p><p>NBA</p><h3>During summers, for what tournaments does ABC air highlight programs?</h3><p>The Open Championship golf and The Wimbledon tennis tournaments</p><p>The Open Championship golf and The Wimbledon</p><p>The Wimbledon</p><h2>While its radio network was undergoing reconstruction, ABC found it difficult to avoid falling behind on the new medium of television. To ensure a space, in 1947, ABC submitted five applications for television station licenses, one for each market where it owned and operated a radio station (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit). These applications all requested for the stations to broadcast on VHF channel 7, as Frank Marx, then ABC's vice-president of engineering, thought that the low-band VHF frequencies (corresponding to channels 2 through 6) would be requisitioned from broadcasting use and reallocated for the U.S. Army.</h2><h3>Who was ABC's vice-president of engineering?</h3><p>Frank Marx</p><p>Frank Marx</p><p>Frank Marx</p><h3>Which channels did Frank Marx think would be requisitioned by the U.S. Army?</h3><p>channels 2 through 6</p><p>2 through 6</p><p>low-band VHF</p><h3>In what year did ABC submit licenses for 5 television stations?</h3><p>1947</p><p>1947</p><p>1947</p><h3>Which channel did the 5 applications request for broadcast?</h3><p>VHF channel 7</p><p>channel 7</p><p>channel 7</p><h2>In the fall of 1949, ABC found itself in the position of an outsider, with less coverage than two of its competing networks, CBS and NBC, even though it was on par with them in some major cities and had a headstart over its third rival at the time, the DuMont Television Network. Before the freeze ended in 1952, there were only 108 existing television stations in the United States; a few major cities (such as Boston) had only two television stations, many other cities (such as Pittsburgh and St. Louis) had only one, and still many others (such as Denver and Portland) did not yet have any television service. The result was a strange period where television flourished in certain areas and network radio remained the main source of broadcast entertainment and news in others.</h2><h3>In 1952, how many television stations were there in the United States?</h3><p>108</p><p>108</p><p>108</p><h3>How many stations did Boston have in 1952?</h3><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><h3>Who was ABC's third major rival in 1949?</h3><p>DuMont Television Network</p><p>DuMont Television Network</p><p>DuMont Television Network</p><h3>In 1949, ABC had less coverage than what competing networks?</h3><p>CBS and NBC</p><p>CBS and NBC</p><p>CBS and NBC</p><h2>At the end of 1949, movie theater operator United Paramount Theatres (UPT) was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to become an independent entity, separating itself from Paramount Pictures. For its part, ABC was on the verge of bankruptcy, with only five owned-and-operated stations and nine full-time affiliates. Its revenues, which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners/viewers, failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations. In 1951, a rumor even mentioned that the network would be sold to CBS. In 1951, Noble held a 58% ownership stake in ABC, giving him $5 million with which to prevent ABC from going bankrupt; as banks refused further credit, that amount was obtained through a loan from the Prudential Insurance Company of America.</h2><h3>In 1949, UPT was forced to become an independent entity by whom?</h3><p>U.S. Supreme Court</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court</p><p>United Paramount Theatres (UPT)</p><h3>Who was UPT forced to separate themselves from in 1949?</h3><p>Paramount Pictures</p><p>Paramount Pictures</p><p>Paramount Pictures</p><h3>How many affiliates did ABC have in 1949?</h3><p>nine</p><p>nine</p><p>nine</p><h3>In 1951, rumors claimed that ABC might be sold to what network?</h3><p>CBS</p><p>CBS</p><p>CBS</p><h3>Noble acquired a loan from what entity to keep ABC solvent in 1951?</h3><p>Prudential Insurance Company of America</p><p>Prudential Insurance Company of America</p><p>Prudential Insurance Company of America.</p><h2>Leonard Goldenson, the president of UPT (which sought to diversify itself at the time), approached Noble in 1951 on a proposal for UPT to purchase ABC. Noble received other offers, including one from CBS founder William S. Paley; however, a merger with CBS would have forced that network to sell its New York City and Los Angeles stations at the very least. Goldenson and Noble reached a tentative agreement in the late spring of 1951 in which UPT would acquire ABC and turn it into a subsidiary of the company that would retain autonomy in its management. On June 6, 1951, the tentative agreement was approved by UPT's board of directors. However, the transaction had to be approved by the FCC because of the presence of television networks and the recent separation between Paramount and UPT. Insofar as Paramount Pictures was already a shareholder in the DuMont Television Network, the FCC conducted a series of hearings to ensure whether Paramount was truly separated from United Paramount Theatres, and whether it was violating antitrust laws.</h2><h3>Who was the president of UPT in 1951?</h3><p>Leonard Goldenson</p><p>Leonard Goldenson</p><p>Leonard Goldenson</p><h3>Who was the founder of CBS?</h3><p>William S.

One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network. On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares. The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan, owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities. To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million, while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV. The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV. Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network.</h2><h3>When was the FCC's sixth report and order released?</h3><p>1952</p><p>1952</p><p>1952</p><h3>When did the FCC approve UPT's purchase of ABC?</h3><p>February 9, 1953</p><p>February 9, 1953</p><p>February 9, 1953</p><h3>When UPT bough ABC, what was the merged company called?</h3><p>American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc</p><p>American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc.</p><p>American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc</p><h3>Where was American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc headquartered after the merger?</h3><p>the Paramount Building</p><p>Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan</p><p>Paramount Building</p><h2>The network's flagship owned-and-operated station, WJZ-TV in New York City (later re-called WABC-TV), signed on the air on August 10, 1948, with its first broadcast running for two hours that evening. ABC's other owned-and-operated stations launched over the course of the next 13 months: WENR-TV in Chicago signed on the air on September 17, while WXYZ-TV in Detroit went on the air on October 9, 1948. In October 1948, as a result of an influx of television station license applications that it had issued as well as a study it undertook on the use of the VHF spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the FCC implemented a freeze on new station applications. However, KGO-TV in San Francisco, which had received its license prior to the freeze, made its debut on May 5, 1949. On May 7, 1949, Billboard revealed that ABC had proposed an investment of $6.25 million, of which it would spend $2.5 million to convert 20 acres (80,937 m2) of land in Hollywood into what would become The Prospect Studios, and construct a transmitter on Mount Wilson, in anticipation of the launch of KECA-TV, which was scheduled to begin operations on August 1 (but would not actually sign on until September 16).</h2><h3>When did WJZ-TV in NYC begin broadcasting?</h3><p>August 10, 1948</p><p>August 10, 1948</p><p>August 10, 1948</p><h3>When did the FCC freeze incoming applications for new stations?</h3><p>October 1948</p><p>October 1948</p><p>October 1948</p><h3>Where did ABC construct it's transmitter for its affiliate station in San Francisco?</h3><p>Mount Wilson</p><p>Mount Wilson</p><p>August 1</p><h3>ABC bought 20 acres of land in Hollwood in 1949 that would become what studio?</h3><p>The Prospect Studios</p><p>The Prospect Studios</p><p>The Prospect Studios</p><h2>The 1960s would be marked by the rise of family-oriented series in an attempt by ABC to counterprogram its established competitors, but the decade was also marked by the network's gradual transition to color. On September 30, 1960, ABC premiered The Flintstones, another example of counterprogramming; although the animated series from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was filmed in color from the beginning, it was initially broadcast in black-and-white, as ABC had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time. The Flintstones allowed ABC to present a novelty, that of prime-time animated programming, but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the Disney partnership by carrying family-oriented programming from other producers.</h2><h3>When did ABC premier the Flintstones?</h3><p>September 30, 1960</p><p>September 30, 1960</p><p>September 30, 1960</p><h3>What decade marked ABC's transition to color programming?</h3><p>1960s</p><p>1960s</p><p>1960s</p><h3>Who were the creators of the Flintstones?</h3><p>William Hanna and Joseph Barbera</p><p>William Hanna and Joseph Barbera</p><p>William Hanna and Joseph Barbera</p><h3>When did ABC begin making family-oriented series?</h3><p>1960s</p><p>1960s</p><h2>In 1959, Walt Disney Productions, having improved its financial situation, had purchased ABC's shares in the Disneyland theme park for $7.5 million and initiated discussions to renew ABC's television contract for Walt Disney Presents, which was due to expire in 1961. Walt Disney was approached by NBC to produce color broadcasts of his anthology series (which would be renamed Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color). Goldenson said ABC could not counter the offer, because the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in the format. As a result, ABC and Disney's first television collaboration ended in 1961 (the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985, when the anthology series returned to the network for a three-season run as the Disney Sunday Movie until it lost the rights to NBC again in 1988; the Disney anthology series would return to ABC in 1996, following the company's purchase of the future Capital Cities/ABC, as The Wonderful World of Disney).</h2><h3>When did Walt Disney Productions purchase ABC's shares in the Disneyland theme park?</h3><p>1959</p><p>1959</p><p>1959</p><h3>What network approached Walt Disney about producing color broadcasts of his anthology series?</h3><p>NBC</p><p>NBC</p><p>NBC</p><h3>When did ABC and Disney's television relationship lapse?</h3><p>1961</p><p>1961</p><p>1961</p><h3>In what year did ABC resume its television relationship with Disney?</h3><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><h2>In 2000, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called &quot;the dot&quot;, in which comic book character Little Dot prompted visitors to &quot;download the dot&quot;, a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner. The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001–02 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.</h2><h3>In 2000, ABC started an internet based campaign focused on what?</h3><p>circle logo</p><p>circle logo</p><p>circle logo</p><h3>Who was hired to produce ABC's 2001-02 identity?</h3><p>Troika Design Group</p><p>Troika Design Group</p><p>Troika Design Group</p><h3>What colors was the 2001 ABC logo?</h3><p>black-and-yellow</p><p>black-and-yellow</p><p>black-and-yellow</p><h3>What is the nickname for ABC's logo from the 2000 campaign?</h3><p>the dot</p><p>&quot;the dot&quot;</p><p>the dot</p><h2>In 1998, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white &quot;ABC Circle&quot; logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup). A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's &quot;We Love TV&quot; image campaign introduced that year, creating an audio signature on par with the NBC chimes, CBS' various three-note soundmarks (including the current version used since 2000) and the Fox Fanfare. The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter (though variants of it used since the 1998–99 season remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs). In the fall of 2015, ABC is stopped with its 1998–2002 four-note jingles for promotions and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs over seventeen years, now it have a different and adventure-type music (with the drums of the network's four-note signature in the ending).

Ten years later, in 1993, the &quot;ABC Circle&quot; logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle. The ABC logo first appeared as a on-screen bug in the 1993–94 season, appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, before appearing throughout programs (except during commercial breaks) beginning in the 1995–96 season; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011–12 season.</h2><h3>In which season did the ABC logo first appear as an on-screen bug?</h3><p>1993–94 season</p><p>1993–94</p><p>1993–94</p><h3>When did the logo bug begin appearing throughout the entire program for ABC shows?</h3><p>1995–96 season</p><p>1995–96</p><p>2011–12</p><h3>In what year was the 40th anniversary of ABC's founding?</h3><p>1983</p><p>1983</p><p>1983</p><h3>What slogan accompanied the 40th anniversary logo for ABC?</h3><p>That Special Feeling</p><p>That Special Feeling</p><p>That Special Feeling</p><h2>The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network in which based the logo's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon and glittering dotted lines.

The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet.

However, during the 2004–05 season, the network experienced unexpected success with new series such as Desperate Housewives, Lost and Grey's Anatomy as well as reality series Dancing with the Stars, which helped ABC rise to second place, jumping ahead of CBS, but behind a surging Fox. On April 21, 2004, Disney announced a restructuring of its Disney Media Networks division with Anne Sweeney being named president of ABC parent Disney–ABC Television Group, and ESPN president George Bodenheimer becoming co-CEO of the division with Sweeney, as well as president of ABC Sports.

In addition to the ABC network, the Disney acquisition integrated ABC's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations; its 80% interest in ESPN, ownership interests in The History Channel, A&amp;E Television Networks, and Lifetime Entertainment; and Capital Cities/ABC's magazine and newspaper properties into the company. As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from keeping both it and KABC-TV, Disney sold Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV to Young Broadcasting for $387 million. On April 4, Disney sold the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion. Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with Robert Iger taking his place as president and CEO. Around the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as Home Improvement and Boy Meets World, while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block. In 1998, ABC premiered the Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom Sports Night, centering on the travails of the staff of a SportsCenter-style sports news program; despite earning critical praise and multiple Emmy Awards, the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons.</h2><h3>When was the Disney and ABC merger first announced?</h3><p>July 31, 1995</p><p>July 31, 1995</p><p>On July 31, 1995</p><h3>What did Disney rename Capital City/ABC after first acquiring the company?</h3><p>ABC Inc.</p><p>ABC Inc.</p><p>ABC Inc</p><h3>Who did Disney sell the four newspapers that ABC controlled to?</h3><p>Knight Ridder</p><p>Knight Ridder</p><p>Knight Ridder</p><h3>Who took Thomas Murphy's place after the Disney acquisition of ABC?</h3><p>Robert Iger</p><p>Robert Iger</p><p>Robert Iger</p><h3>What Aaron Sorkin created show did ABC debut in 1998?</h3><p>Sports Night</p><p>Sports Night</p><p>Sports Night</p><h2>It was not until the 1965–66 season that color became the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks.

The WABC call letters were previously used by the flagship station of CBS Radio (now WCBS (AM)) until 1946.

Despite the promise of non-interference between ABC and UPT, Goldenson had to intervene in ABC's decisions because of financial problems and the FCC's long period of indecision. Goldenson added to the confusion when, in October 1954, he proposed a merger between UPT and the DuMont Television Network, which was also mired in financial trouble. As part of this merger, the network would have been renamed &quot;ABC-DuMont&quot; for five years, and DuMont would have received $5 million in cash, room on the schedule for existing DuMont programming, and guaranteed advertising time for DuMont Laboratories receivers. In addition, to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, it would have been required to sell either WABC-TV or DuMont owned-and-operated station WABD in the New York City market, as well as two other stations. The merged ABC-DuMont would have had the resources to compete with CBS and NBC.</h2><h3>Who was appointed to be ABC's president by Noble in 1950?</h3><p>Robert Kintner</p><p>Robert Kintner</p><p>Robert Kintner</p><h3>Goldenson proposed a merger between UPT and what network in October 1954?</h3><p>DuMont Television Network</p><p>DuMont Television Network</p><p>DuMont Television Network</p><h3>Under Goldenson's merger plan, what would the new entity be named?</h3><p>ABC-DuMont</p><p>ABC-DuMont</p><p>ABC-DuMont</p><h3>How much money was to go to DuMont Television Network under Goldenson's merger plan?</h3><p>$5 million in cash</p><p>$5 million in cash</p><p>$5 million</p><h2>At the same time he made attempts to help grow ABC, Goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in Hollywood, with whom he had worked when UPT was a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. ABC's merger with UPT led to the creation of relationships with Hollywood's film production studios, breaking a quarantine that had existed at that time between film and television, the latter of which had previously been more connected to radio. ABC's flagship productions at the time were The Lone Ranger, based on the radio program of the same title, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, the latter of which (at 13 seasons, running from 1952 to 1965) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in U.S. television history, until it was surpassed by The Simpsons in 2002.</h2><h3>Of what hollywood film company was UPT a subsidiary of when it merged with ABC?</h3><p>Paramount Pictures</p><p>Paramount Pictures</p><p>Paramount Pictures</p><h3>What Western was a flagship program for ABC around 1954?</h3><p>The Lone Ranger</p><p>The Lone Ranger</p><p>The Lone Ranger</p><h3>What ABC comedy had the record for the longest running comedy until being passed by the Simpsons in 2002?</h3><p>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</p><p>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</p><p>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</p><h2>Warner tried with mixed success to adapt some of its most successful films as ABC television series, and showcase these adaptations as part of the wheel series Warner Bros.

Around 1954, ABC agreed to finance Disneyland in exchange for the right to broadcast a new Sunday night program, Disneyland, which debuted on the network on October 27, 1954 as the first of many anthology television programs that Disney would broadcast over the course of the next 50 years.</h2><h3>What was Walt Disney's brother's name?</h3><p>Roy</p><p>Roy</p><p>Roy</p><h3>How much did Walt Disney want ABC to invest in Disneyland?</h3><p>$500,000</p><p>$500,000</p><p>$500,000</p><h3>In what year did ABC agree to finance Disneyland?</h3><p>1954</p><p>1954</p><p>1954</p><h3>What was the first Disney program televised on ABC as a result of the Disney-ABC agreement?</h3><p>Disneyland</p><p>Disneyland</p><p>Disneyland</p><h2>In July 1968, ABC Radio launched a special programming project for its FM stations, which was spearheaded by Allen Shaw, a former program manager at WCFL in Chicago who was approached by ABC Radio president Harold L. Neal to develop a format to compete with the new progressive rock and DJ-helmed stations. The new concept called &quot;LOVE Radio&quot;, which featured a limited selection of music genres, was launched on ABC's seven owned-and-operated FM stations in late November 1968; the concept replaced nearly all of the programming provided by these stations; however, several affiliates (such as KXYZ) retained the majority of their content. In August 1970, Shaw announced that ABC FM's music choice policy should be reviewed to allow listeners access to many styles of music.</h2><h3>Who lead the 1968 special programming for ABC Radio's FM stations?</h3><p>Allen Shaw</p><p>Allen Shaw</p><p>Allen Shaw</p><h3>Who was the ABC Radio president in 1968?</h3><p>Harold L.

The Movie of the Week broadcast feature-length dramatic films directed by such talented filmmakers as Aaron Spelling, David Wolper and Steven Spielberg (the latter of whom gained early success through the showcase for his 1971 film Duel) that were produced on an average budget of $400,000–$450,000. Hits for the television network during the late 1960s and early 1970s included The Courtship of Eddie's Father, The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family.</h2><h3>In what year did ABC launch the Movie of the Week?</h3><p>1969</p><p>1969</p><p>September 1969</p><h3>For which ABC Movie of the Week film did Steven Spielberg first gain success?</h3><p>Duel</p><p>Duel</p><p>Duel</p><h3>When did the Steven Spielberg movie Duel first debut?</h3><p>1971</p><p>1971</p><p>1971</p><h3>What was the average budget for ABC Movie of the Week films?</h3><p>$400,000–$450,000</p><p>$400,000–$450,000</p><p>$400,000–$450,000</p><h2>In the early 1970s, ABC completed its transition to color; the decade as a whole would mark a turning point for ABC, as it began to pass CBS and NBC in the ratings to become the first place network. It also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine what types of sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences. ABC's gains in audience share were greatly helped by the fact that several smaller markets had grown large enough to allow full-time affiliations from all three networks.</h2><h3>In what decade did ABC finish transitioning to color?</h3><p>early 1970s</p><p>1970s</p><p>1970s</p><h3>The 1970s allowed which network to move in to first place in the ratings?</h3><p>ABC</p><p>ABC</p><p>ABC</p><h3>What kind of data did ABC begin using in the 1970s to better target ads and programming for certain audiences?</h3><p>behavioral and demographic data</p><p>behavioral and demographic</p><p>behavioral and demographic</p><h2>In 1970, ABC debuted Monday Night Football as part of its Monday prime time schedule; the program became a hit for the network and served as the National Football League (NFL)'s premier game of the week until 2006, when Sunday Night Football, which moved to NBC that year as part of a broadcast deal that in turn saw MNF move to ESPN, took over as the league's marquee game. According to Goldenson, Monday Night Football helped earn ABC regularly score an audience share of 15%–16%; ABC Sports managed the budget for the Monday night time slot to reallocate the weekly budget for ABC's prime time schedule to just six days, as opposed to seven on competing networks. 1970 also saw the premieres of several soap operas including the long-running All My Children, which ran on the network for 41 years.</h2><h3>What football program was debuted by ABC in 1970?</h3><p>Monday Night Football</p><p>Monday Night Football</p><p>Monday Night Football</p><h3>When did Sunday Night Football premiere on NBC?</h3><p>2006</p><p>2006</p><p>2006</p><h3>When Sunday Night Football premiered, to which network did Monday Night Football move?</h3><p>ESPN</p><p>ESPN</p><p>NBC</p><h3>What kind of audience share did MNF allow ABC to attain according to Goldenson?</h3><p>15%–16%</p><p>15%–16%</p><p>15%–16%</p><h2>In 1970, the FCC voted to pass the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, a set of regulations aimed at preventing the major networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by barring them from owning any of the prime time programming that they broadcast. In 1972, the new rules resulted in the company's decision to split ABC Films into two separate companies: the existing Worldvision Enterprises, which would produce and distribute programming for U.S. syndication, and ABC Circle Films as a production unit. Worldvision was sold to a consortium of ABC executives for nearly $10 million.</h2><h3>In what year did the FCC vote for the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules?</h3><p>1970</p><p>1970</p><p>1970</p><h3>What year did the Financial Interest and Syndication rules result in ABC's decision to split ABC Films into two companies?</h3><p>1972</p><p>1972</p><p>1972</p><h3>Which new subdivision of ABC films produced programming for U.S. syndication?</h3><p>Worldvision Enterprises</p><p>Worldvision Enterprises</p><p>Worldvision Enterprises</p><h2>In April 1970, Congress passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act which banned cigarette advertising from all television and radio networks, including ABC, when it took effect on January 2, 1971. Citing limited profitability of its cinemas, ABC Great States, the Central West division of ABC Theatres, was sold to Henry Plitt in 1974. On January 17, 1972, Elton Rule was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC a few months after Goldenson reduced his role in the company after suffering a heart attack.</h2><h3>What did the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act ban?</h3><p>cigarette advertising from all television and radio networks</p><p>cigarette advertising</p><p>1970</p><h3>When did the ban on cigarette advertising take effect for television networks?</h3><p>January 2, 1971</p><p>January 2, 1971</p><p>January 2, 1971</p><h3>Who was ABC Great States sold to in 1974?</h3><p>Henry Plitt</p><p>Henry Plitt</p><p>Henry Plitt</p><h3>Who was named the president and CEO of ABC after Goldenson suffered a heart attack?</h3><p>Elton Rule</p><p>Elton Rule</p><p>Elton Rule</p><h2>In the early 1970s, Michael Eisner, who joined ABC in 1966, became the network's program development manager. He helped bring about ideas for many series including Happy Days (which originated as a segment on the anthology series Love, American Style), as well as several soap operas; however, Eisner's main credit at ABC was for developing youth-oriented programming. He was responsible for reacquiring the rights to the Looney Tunes-Merrie Melodies library, bringing the shorts back to ABC after spending several years on CBS, as well as developing The Jackson 5ive animated series and a series about the Osmonds, and greenlighting Super Friends, based on DC Comics' Justice League of America series. Eisner left ABC in 1976 to become president of Paramount Pictures (and would later become the President of ABC's eventual parent company, Disney).</h2><h3>When did Michael Eisner first join ABC?</h3><p>1966</p><p>1966</p><p>1966</p><h3>What ABC series originated as short segment on Love, American Style?</h3><p>Happy Days</p><p>Happy Days</p><p>Happy Days</p><h3>What was Michael Eisner's main credit in his time at ABC?</h3><p>youth-oriented programming</p><p>developing youth-oriented programming</p><p>developing youth-oriented programming</p><h3>What company did Eisner become president of when he left ABC in 1976?</h3><p>Paramount Pictures</p><p>Paramount Pictures</p><p>Paramount Pictures</p><h2>In the spring of 1975, Fred Pierce, the newly appointed president of ABC Television, convinced Fred Silverman to become the first president and director of programming of the independent television production subsidiary ABC Entertainment, created from the network's namesake programming division. In 1974, ABC premiered the detective series S.W.A.T. That same year, the network made the decision to compete with NBC's morning news-talk program Today. Its first attempt at such competition was AM America; however, that show's success was not straightforward. One of its affiliates, WCVB-TV premiered morning show Good Day!. First premiering in 1973 as Good Morning!, it was groundbreaking for being entirely produced on the road and broadcasting from locations outside of the Boston area. Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate WEWS-TV was producing its own morning program The Morning Exchange, which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting AM America; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a living room, and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at the top and bottom of each hour. Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers, the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, Good Morning America, which debuted on November 3, 1975.</h2><h3>Who was the President of ABC television in 1976?</h3><p>Fred Pierce</p><p>Fred Pierce</p><h3>Who was the first president and director of programming for ABC Entertainment?</h3><p>Fred Silverman</p><p>Fred Silverman</p><p>Fred Silverman</p><h3>In 1974, what detective series debuted on ABC?</h3><p>S.W.A.T</p><p>S.W.A.T.</p><p>S.W.A.T</p><h3>When did Good Morning America first debut?</h3><p>November 3, 1975</p><p>November 3, 1975</p><p>1973</p><h2>The 1970s were highlighted by several successful comedy, fantasy, action and superhero-themed series for the network including Kung Fu, The Six Million Dollar Man, Wonder Woman, Starsky &amp; Hutch, Charlie's Angels, The Bionic Woman, Fantasy Island and Battlestar Galactica. Many of these series were greenlit by Silverman, who left ABC in 1978 to become president of NBC's entertainment division. The rousing success of Happy Days also led to a successful spin-off series, Laverne &amp; Shirley, which debuted in 1976. Charlie's Angels and Three's Company (which debuted in 1977) were two prime examples of a trend among the major networks during the 1970s known as &quot;jiggle TV&quot;, featuring attractive, often buxom, women in main and guest roles.</h2><h3>What position did Fred Silverman leave ABC to take in 1978?</h3><p>president of NBC's entertainment division</p><p>president of NBC's entertainment division</p><p>president of NBC</p><h3>What spinoff of Happy Days debuted in 1976?</h3><p>Laverne &amp; Shirley</p><p>Laverne &amp; Shirley</p><p>Laverne &amp; Shirley</p><h3>What television trend are Charlies Angels and Three's Company an example of?</h3><p>jiggle TV</p><p>&quot;jiggle TV&quot;</p><p>&quot;jiggle TV&quot;</p><h2>For its part, the television network produced a few new hits during 1977: January saw the premiere of Roots, a miniseries based on an Alex Haley novel that was published the previous year; in September, The Love Boat, a comedy-drama anthology series produced by Aaron Spelling which was based around the crew of a cruise ship and featured three stories centered partly on the ship's various passengers; although critically lambasted, the series turned out to be a ratings success and lasted nine seasons. Roots went on to become one of the highest-rated programs in American television history, with unprecedented ratings for its finale. The success of Roots, Happy Days and The Love Boat allowed the network to take first place in the ratings for the first time in the 1976–77 season. On September 13, 1977, the network debuted Soap, a controversial soap opera parody which became known for being the first television series to feature an openly gay main character (played by a then-unknown Billy Crystal); it last ran on the network on April 20, 1981.</h2><h3>The Roots miniseries was based on a novel by what author?</h3><p>Alex Haley</p><p>Alex Haley</p><p>Alex Haley</p><h3>Who produced the comedy-drama The Love Boat?</h3><p>Aaron Spelling</p><p>Aaron Spelling</p><p>Aaron Spelling</p><h3>How many seasons did The Love Boat run for?</h3><p>nine seasons</p><p>nine</p><p>nine</p><h3>During which season did ABC first take the lead spot in television rating?</h3><p>1976–77 season</p><p>1976–77</p><p>1976–77</p><h3>What was the first television series to feature an openly gay character?</h3><p>Soap</p><p>Soap</p><p>Soap</p><h2>Meanwhile, ABC News, which formed as a newly separate division, sought to become a global leader in television news. In 1977, Roone Arledge was named president of the new ABC News in addition to being president of ABC Sports. That same year, ABC launched a major expansion of its office facilities in New York City. The company first constructed a new 10-story building on land previously occupied by an abandoned warehouse on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street; the facility that was built in its place is nicknamed &quot;7 Lincoln Square&quot; (although it is actually located at 149 Columbus Avenue). Meanwhile, a former parking lot, located at 30 West 67th Street, was transformed into an impressive 15-story building. Both buildings were completed in June 1979. WABC-TV moved its operations from offices at 77 West 66th Street to 149 Columbus Avenue, freeing up space for the ABC network to house some of its operations.</h2><h3>Who was named the president of ABC News in 1977?</h3><p>Roone Arledge</p><p>Roone Arledge</p><p>Roone Arledge</p><h3>Besides ABC News, what other division was Roone Arledge president of?</h3><p>ABC Sports</p><p>ABC Sports</p><p>ABC Sports</p><h3>What is the nickname for the ABC facility built at Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street?</h3><p>7 Lincoln Square</p><p>7 Lincoln Square</p><p>7 Lincoln Square</p><h3>When was 7 Lincoln Square completed?</h3><p>June 1979</p><p>June 1979</p><p>1979</p><h2>In June 1978, Arledge created the newsmagazine 20/20; after its first episode received harshly negative reviews, the program – which debuted as a summer series, before becoming a year-round program in 1979 – was immediately revamped to feature a mix of in-depth stories and interviews, with Hugh Downs appointed as its anchor (later paired alongside his former Today colleague Barbara Walters). In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, and all of its 300 employees were laid off (the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels have since been acquired by Universal Music Group).</h2><h3>When was the newsmagazine 20/20 first created?</h3><p>June 1978</p><p>June 1978</p><p>June 1978</p><h3>Who was first appointed at the anchor of 20/20?</h3><p>Hugh Downs</p><p>Hugh Downs</p><p>Hugh Downs</p><h3>Which female anchor from Today joined Hugh Downs on 20/20?</h3><p>Barbara Walters</p><p>Barbara Walters</p><p>Barbara Walters</p><h3>Who did ABC sell it's recording division to in 1979?</h3><p>MCA Inc.</p><p>MCA Inc.</p><p>MCA Inc</p><h2>In order to compete with CNN, ABC proposed a 24-hour news channel called ABC Cable News, with plans to launch the network in 1995; however, the plan would ultimately be shelved by company management. ABC would reattempt such a concept in July 2004 with the launch of ABC News Now, a 24-hour news channel distributed for viewing on the Internet and mobile phones. On August 29, 1994, ABC purchased Flint, Michigan affiliate WJRT-TV and WTVG in Toledo, Ohio (which was previously affiliated with ABC from 1958 to 1970) from SJL Broadcast Management, with the latter switching to ABC once its contract with NBC expired two months after the purchase was finalized in early 1995. Both stations were acquired as a contingency plan in the event that CBS reached an affiliation deal with WXYZ-TV (to replace WJBK, which switched to Fox as a result of that network's group affiliation agreement with New World Communications) in order to allow the network to retain some over-the-air presence in the Detroit market (the E.W. Scripps Company and ABC would reach a group affiliation deal that renewed affiliation agreements with WXYZ and WEWS, and switch four other stations, including two whose Fox affiliations were displaced by the New World deal, with the network).</h2><h3>What channel did ABC proposed to compete with cable news company CNN?</h3><p>ABC Cable News</p><p>ABC Cable News</p><p>ABC Cable News</p><h3>What news network did ABC launch in July 2004?</h3><p>ABC News Now</p><p>ABC News Now</p><p>ABC News Now</p><h3>In August 1994, which Flint, Michigan affiliate did ABC purchase?</h3><p>WJRT-TV</p><p>WJRT-TV</p><p>WJRT-TV</p><h3>In August 1994, what Toledo, Ohio affiliate did ABC purchase?</h3><p>WTVG</p><p>WTVG</p><p>WTVG</p><h2>The Writers Guild of America strike that halted production of network programs for much of the 2007–08 season affected the network in 2007–08 and 2008–09, as various ABC shows that premiered in 2007, such as Dirty Sexy Money, Pushing Daisies, Eli Stone and Samantha Who?, did not live to see a third season; other series such as Boston Legal and the U.S. version of Life on Mars suffered from low viewership, despite the former, a spin off of The Practice, being a once-highlighted breakout series when it debuted in 2005. One of the network's strike-replacement programs during that time was the game show Duel, which premiered in December 2007. The program would become a minor success for the network during its initial six-episode run, which led ABC to renew Duel as a regular series starting in April 2008. However, Duel suffered from low viewership during its run as a regular series, and ABC canceled the program after sixteen episodes. On August 15, 2008, Disney denied rumors started by Caris &amp; Co. that it would be selling the ten ABC owned-and-operated stations.</h2><h3>A strike by what entity resulted in a halt to production for network programs in the 2007-2008 season?</h3><p>Writers Guild of America</p><p>The Writers Guild of America</p><p>Writers Guild of America</p><h3>What game show debuted on ABC in 2007 as a replacement for striking programs?</h3><p>Duel</p><p>Duel</p><p>Duel</p><h3>Who started rumors in 2008 that ABC would sell its ten owned-and-operated stations?</h3><p>Caris &amp; Co.</p><p>Caris &amp; Co.</p><p>Caris &amp; Co.</p><h2>In early 2009, Disney–ABC Television Group merged ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios into a new division, ABC Entertainment Group, which would be responsible for both its production and broadcasting operations.

The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since Paramount Television acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into CBS Television Distribution, a unit of CBS Corporation. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the Ruby-Spears and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to Turner Broadcasting System in 1990.

The network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year's debuts, with only late-season premiere Happy Endings earning a second season. Meanwhile, the new lows hit by Brothers &amp; Sisters led to its cancellation, and the previous year's only drama renewal, V, also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run. Despite this and another noticeable ratings decline, ABC would manage to outrate NBC for third place by a larger margin than the previous year.</h2><h3>What was the only drama extended for a second season for the 2010-11 schedule?</h3><p>Body of Proof</p><p>Body of Proof</p><p>Body of Proof</p><h3>What was the only comedy to earn a second season for the 2010-11 schedule?</h3><p>Happy Endings</p><p>Happy Endings</p><p>Happy Endings</p><h3>What network did ABC beat out for third place in television ratings in 2010-11?</h3><p>NBC</p><p>NBC</p><p>NBC</p><h3>What drama program was canceled by ABC after a bad midseason run in 2010-11?</h3><p>V</p><p>V</p><p>Brothers &amp; Sisters</p><h2>On April 14, 2011, ABC canceled the long-running soap operas All My Children and One Life to Live after 41 and 43 years on the air, respectively (following backlash from fans, ABC sold the rights to both shows to Prospect Park, which eventually revived the soaps on Hulu for one additional season in 2013 and with both companies suing one another for allegations of interference with the process of reviving the shows, failure to pay licensing fees and issues over ABC's use of certain characters from One Live to Live on General Hospital during the transition). The talk/lifestyle show that replaced One Life to Live, The Revolution, failed to generate satisfactory ratings and was in turn canceled after only seven months. The 2011–12 season saw ABC drop to fourth place in the 18–49 demographic despite renewing a handful of new shows (including freshmen dramas Scandal, Revenge and Once Upon a Time) for second seasons.</h2><h3>What soap operas did ABC cancel in 2011?</h3><p>All My Children and One Life to Live</p><p>All My Children and One Life to Live</p><p>All My Children and One Life to Live</p><h3>Who did ABC sell the rights to All My Children and One Life to Live to?</h3><p>Prospect Park</p><p>Prospect Park</p><p>Prospect Park</p><h3>On what service were All My Children and One Life to Live revived on for one season?</h3><p>Hulu</p><p>Hulu</p><p>Hulu</p><h3>What talk show replaced One Life to Live?</h3><p>The Revolution</p><p>The Revolution</p><p>The Revolution</p><h3>2011-12 saw ABC drop to 4th in ratings among what important demographic?</h3><p>18–49 demographic</p><p>18–49</p><p>18–49</p><h2>The 2013–14 season was a slight improvement for ABC with three new hits in The Goldbergs, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Resurrection, all of which were renewed; however, that season saw the cancellations of holdovers The Neighbors (which languished in its new Friday time slot despite being bookended by Last Man Standing and Shark Tank) and Suburgatory. NBC, which had lagged behind ABC for eight years, finished the season in first place in the 18–49 demographic for the first time since 2004, and in second place in total viewership behind long-dominant CBS. ABC itself would finish the season in third place as Fox crashed to fourth in both demographics.</h2><h3>In 2013-14, NBC finished in first place in the 18-49 demographic for the first time since when?</h3><p>2004</p><p>eight years</p><p>2004</p><h3>In 2013-14, NBC finished behind what network in the ratings?</h3><p>CBS</p><p>CBS</p><p>CBS</p><h3>What Comic Book series did ABC debut in 2013-14?</h3><p>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</p><h3>What program that aired between Last Man Standing and Shark Tank was cancelled by ABC in 2013?</h3><p>The Neighbors</p><p>The Neighbors</p><p>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</p><h2>Among the few bright spots during this season were the midseason crime dramedy Castle as well as the success of two family sitcoms that anchored the network's revamped Wednesday comedy lineup, The Middle and Modern Family, the latter of which was both a critical and commercial success. Shark Tank (based on the Dragon's Den reality format) also became a midseason sleeper hit on Sundays in the spring of 2010; the following season, it became the tentpole of the network's Friday night schedule, gradually helping make ABC a strong competitor (after being paired with 20/20 and beginning with the 2012–13 season, the Tim Allen sitcom Last Man Standing) against CBS' long-dominant drama/reality lineup on that night for the first time since the &quot;TGIF&quot; lineup ended in 2000.</h2><h3>What two comedies were featured on ABC's new Wednesday comedy lineup?</h3><p>The Middle and Modern Family</p><p>The Middle and Modern Family</p><p>The Middle and Modern Family</p><h3>Shark Tank was based on what other reality show?</h3><p>Dragon's Den</p><p>Dragon's Den</p><p>Dragon's Den</p><h3>What day of the week did Shark Tank debut on?</h3><p>Sundays</p><p>Sundays</p><p>Sundays</p><h3>In 2012-13, ABC debuted a comedy Last Man Standing starring who?</h3><p>Tim Allen</p><p>Tim Allen</p><p>Tim Allen</p><h2>Daniel Burke departed from Capital Cities/ABC in February 1994, with Thomas Murphy taking over as president before ceding control to Robert Iger.

The network's finances improved and allowed it to invest in other properties and programming. In May 1960, ABC purchased Chicago radio station WLS, which had shared airtime with WENR since the 1920s. This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market. On May 9, 1960, WLS launched a new lineup consisting of ABC Radio programming. In 1960, Canadian entrepreneur John Bassett, who was trying to establish a television station in Toronto, sought the help of ABC to launch the station. Leonard Goldenson agreed to acquire a 25% interest in CFTO-TV; however, legislation by the Canadian Radio-Television Commission prohibited ABC's involvement, resulting in the company withdrawing from the project before the station's launch.</h2><h3>What radio station did ABC purchase in May 1960?</h3><p>WLS</p><p>WLS</p><p>WLS</p><h3>When did WLS launch a lineup of ABC radio programs?</h3><p>May 9, 1960</p><p>May 9, 1960</p><p>May 9, 1960</p><h3>What Canadian investor sought ABC's help in launching a station in 1960?</h3><p>John Bassett</p><p>John Bassett</p><p>John Bassett</p><h3>What project did Leonard Goldenson offer to invest in before the Canadian Radio-Television Commission ruled against ABC?</h3><p>CFTO-TV</p><p>CFTO-TV</p><p>CFTO-TV</p><h2>Always in search of new programs that would help it compete with NBC and CBS, ABC's management believed that sports could be a major catalyst in improving the network's market share. On April 29, 1961, ABC debuted Wide World of Sports, an anthology series created by Edgar Scherick through his company Sports Programs, Inc. and produced by a young Roone Arledge which featured a different sporting event each broadcast. ABC purchased Sports Programs, Inc. in exchange for shares in the company, leading it to become the future core of ABC Sports, with Arledge as the executive producer of that division's shows. Wide World of Sports, in particular, was not merely devoted to a single sport, but rather to generally all sporting events.</h2><h3>ABC debuted what sports program on April 29, 1961?</h3><p>Wide World of Sports</p><p>Wide World of Sports</p><p>Wide World of Sports</p><h3>Who created ABC's Wide World of Sports?</h3><p>Edgar Scherick</p><p>Edgar Scherick</p><p>Edgar Scherick</p><h3>Who originally produced Wide World of Sports for ABC?</h3><p>Roone Arledge</p><p>Roone Arledge</p><p>Roone Arledge</p><h3>ABC purchased which of Edgar Scherick's company?</h3><p>Sports Programs, Inc.</p><p>Sports Programs, Inc.</p><p>Sports Programs, Inc</p><h2>In 1965, the corporate entity, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, was renamed as the American Broadcasting Companies,  while its cinema division became ABC Theatres;[citation needed] its recording division was renamed ABC Records in 1966. In December of that year, the ABC television network premiered The Dating Game, a pioneer series in its genre, which was a reworking of the blind date concept in which a suitor selected one of three contestants sight unseen based on the answers to selected questions. This was followed up in July 1966 by The Newlywed Game, featuring three recently married couples who guessed the responses to their partner's questions (some of which were fairly risque). As ABC began to outgrow its facilities at 7 West 66th Street, Goldenson found a new headquarters for ABC in a 44 story building located at 1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, at the corner of 54th Street (now occupied by The Financial Times's New York office). This operation allowed for the conversion of the premises at 66th Street into production facilities for television and radio programs.</h2><h3>What was the corporate entity American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres renamed in 1965? </h3><p>American Broadcasting Companies</p><p>American Broadcasting Companies</p><p>American Broadcasting Companies</p><h3>What was the name of the blind date concept program debuted by ABC in 1966?</h3><p>The Dating Game</p><p>The Dating Game</p><p>The Dating Game</p><h3>What gameshow featuring newly married people was debuted by ABC in July 1966?</h3><p>The Newlywed Game</p><p>The Newlywed Game</p><p>The Newlywed Game</p><h3>At what address did Goldenson secure a new headquarters for ABC?</h3><p>1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan</p><p>1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan</p><p>1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan</p><h2>ABC dominated the American television landscape during the 1970s and early 1980s (by 1980, the three major networks represented 90% of all prime-time television viewership in the U.S.). Several flagship series debuted on the network during this time including Dynasty, an opulent drama from Aaron Spelling that became a hit when it premiered as a midseason series in 1981, five months before Spelling's other ABC hit Charlie's Angels ended its run. The network was also propelled during the early 1980s by the continued successes of Happy Days, Three's Company, Laverne &amp; Shirley and Fantasy Island, and gained new hits in Too Close for Comfort, Soap spinoff Benson and Happy Days spinoff Mork &amp; Mindy. In 1981, ABC (through its ABC Video Services division) launched the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS), a cable channel operated as a joint venture with the Hearst Corporation offering cultural and arts programming, which aired as a nighttime service over the channel space of Nickelodeon.</h2><h3>What percentage of prime-time TV viewership did the three big networks represent in 1980?</h3><p>90%</p><p>90%</p><p>90%</p><h3>What drama from Aaron Spelling debuted on ABC in the 80s?</h3><p>Dynasty</p><p>Dynasty</p><p>Dynasty</p><h3>What was a Happy Days spinoff that debuted in the 1980s on ABC?</h3><p>Mork &amp; Mindy</p><p>Mork &amp; Mindy</p><p>Mork &amp; Mindy</p><h3>What channel did ABC launch in 1981 that focused on cultural and arts programming?</h3><p>Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS)</p><p>Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS)</p><p>Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS)</p><h2>In 1983, ABC sold KXYZ to the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation.

In June 1984, ABC's executive committee approved the company's interest acquisition in ESPN, and ABC arranged with Getty Oil to obtain an 80% stake in the channel, while selling the remaining 20% to Nabisco. That year, ABC and Hearst reached an agreement with RCA to merge ARTS and competing arts service, The Entertainment Channel, into a single cable channel called Arts &amp; Entertainment Television (A&amp;E); the new channel subsequently leased a separate satellite transponder, ending its sharing agreement with Nickelodeon to become a 24-hour service.

Murphy delegated his position as president to Daniel B. Burke while remaining ABC's chairman and CEO. Capital Cities/ABC reported revenues of $465 million. Now at a strong second place, the network entered the 1990s with additional family-friendly hits including America's Funniest Home Videos (which has gone on to become the longest-running prime time entertainment program in the network's history), Step by Step, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Boy Meets World and Perfect Strangers spinoff Family Matters, as well as series such as Doogie Howser, M.D., Life Goes On, cult favorite Twin Peaks and The Commish. In September 1991, the network premiered Home Improvement, a sitcom starring stand-up comic Tim Allen centering on the family and work life of an accident-prone host of a cable-access home improvement show. Lasting nine seasons, its success led ABC to greenlight additional sitcom projects helmed by comedians during the 1990s including The Drew Carey Show; Brett Butler vehicle Grace Under Fire; and Ellen, which became notable for a 1997 episode which served as the coming out of series star Ellen DeGeneres (as well as her character in the series) as a lesbian.</h2><h3>Who succeeded Thomas Murphy as president in 1990?</h3><p>Daniel B.

However that year, ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC. Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band. Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.</h2><h3>How many primary affiliates did ABC have in 1954?</h3><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><h3>How many primary affiliates did CBS have in 1954?</h3><p>74</p><p>74</p><p>71</p><h3>What important legislation was passed by Congress for the television industry in 1961?</h3><p>All-Channel Receiver Act</p><p>All-Channel Receiver Act</p><p>All-Channel Receiver Act</p><h3>The All-Channel Receiver Act mandated the support of what kind of tuning?</h3><p>UHF tuning</p><p>UHF</p><p>UHF</p><h2>As a result, with the exception of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in Youngstown, Ohio, now WYTV, despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to Cleveland and Pittsburgh even decades before the city's economic collapse). According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors. However, the network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production. Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s, which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.</h2><h3>ABC had secondary status on the existing stations in what Ohio town?</h3><p>Youngstown</p><p>WKST-TV in Youngstown</p><p>Youngstown</p><h3>Relegation to secondary status for ABC resulted in viewership how much lower than their competitors, according to Goldenson?</h3><p>five times lower viewership</p><p>five times</p><p>five times</p><h3>The beginnings of digital television allowed what affiliate in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programs digitally?</h3><p>WTRF-TV</p><p>WTRF-TV</p><p>WTRF-TV</p><h3>Very small markets had to wait until what decade to support an ABC affiliate?</h3><p>1980s</p><p>1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s</p><p>1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s</p><h2>On September 3, 1958, the Disneyland anthology series was retitled Walt Disney Presents as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name. The movement in westerns, which ABC is credited for having started, represented a fifth of all primetime series on American television in January 1959, at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well. ABC requested additional productions from Disney. In late 1958, Desilu Productions pitched its detective series The Untouchables to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show, and debuted The Untouchables in April 1959. The series went on to quickly become &quot;immensely popular&quot;.</h2><h3>What was the Disneyland anthology series retitled in 1958?</h3><p>Walt Disney Presents</p><p>Walt Disney Presents</p><p>Walt Disney Presents</p><h3>What production company pitched The Untouchables to CBS in 1958?</h3><p>Desilu Productions</p><p>Desilu Productions</p><p>Desilu Productions</p><h3>Why did CBS turn down the pitch for The Untouchables?</h3><p>its use of violence</p><p>its use of violence</p><p>violence</p><h3>When did the Untouchables debut on ABC?</h3><p>April 1959</p><p>April 1959</p><p>April 1959</p><h2>Due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, ABC joined CBS and NBC in broadcasting films on Sunday nights in 1962, with the launch of the ABC Sunday Night Movie, which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white. Despite a significant increase in viewership (with its audience share having increased to 33% from the 15% share it had in 1953), ABC remained in third place; the company had a total revenue of $15.5 million, a third of the revenue pulled in by CBS at the same period. To catch up, ABC followed up The Flintstones with another animated series from Hanna-Barbera, The Jetsons, which debuted on September 23, 1962 as the first television series to be broadcast in color on the network. On April 1, 1963, ABC debuted the soap opera General Hospital, which would go on to become the television network's long-running entertainment program. That year also saw the premiere of The Fugitive (on September 17), a drama series centering on a man on the run after being accused of committing a murder he did not commit.</h2><h3>What was the title of ABC's broadcast film program that debuted on Sundays in 1962?</h3><p>ABC Sunday Night Movie</p><p>ABC Sunday Night Movie</p><p>ABC Sunday Night Movie</p><h3>What was ABC's revenue in 1962?</h3><p>$15.5 million</p><p>$15.5</p><p>$15.5 million</p><h3>What production company produced the animated series The Flintstones for ABC?</h3><p>Hanna-Barbera</p><p>Hanna-Barbera</p><p>Hanna-Barbera</p><h3>What was the first series to be televised in color on ABC?</h3><p>The Jetsons</p><p>The Jetsons</p><p>The Jetsons</p><h3>When did General Hospital first debut on ABC?</h3><p>April 1, 1963</p><p>April 1, 1963</p><p>April 1, 1963</p><h2>On December 7, 1965, Goldenson announced a merger proposal with ITT to ABC management; the two companies agreed to the deal on April 27, 1966. The FCC approved the merger on December 21, 1966; however, the previous day (December 20), Donald F. Turner, head antitrust regulator for the United States Department of Justice, expressed doubts related to such issues as the emerging cable television market, and concerns over the journalistic integrity of ABC and how it could be influenced by the overseas ownership of ITT. ITT management promised that the company would allow ABC to retain autonomy in the publishing business. The merger was suspended, and a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice in July 1967, with ITT going to trial in October 1967; the merger was officially canceled after the trial's conclusion on January 1, 1968.</h2><h3>Leonard Goldenson announced a merger proposal with what company in December 1965?</h3><p>ITT</p><p>ITT</p><p>ITT</p><h3>What anitrust regulator had doubts about the ITT and ABC merger?</h3><p>Donald F.

Murphy, chief executive officer of Capital Cities Communications, contacted Leonard Goldenson about a proposal to merge their respective companies. On March 16, 1985, ABC's executive committee accepted the merger offer, which was formally announced on March 18, 1985, with Capital Cities purchasing ABC and its related properties for $3.5 billion and $118 for each of ABC's shares as well as a guarantee of 10% (or $3) for a total of $121 per share. To finance the purchase, Capital Cities borrowed $2.1 billion from a consortium of banks, which sold certain assets that Capital Cites could not acquire or retain due to FCC ownership rules for a combined $900 million and sold off several cable television systems, which were sold to The Washington Post Company (forming the present-day Cable One). The remaining $500 million was loaned by Warren Buffett, who promised that his company Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $3 million in shares, at $172.50 apiece. Due to an FCC ban on same-market ownership of television and radio stations by a single company (although the deal would have otherwise complied with new ownership rules implemented by the FCC in January 1985, that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations), ABC and Capital Cities respectively decided to sell WXYZ-TV and Tampa independent station WFTS-TV to the E. W. Scripps Company (although Capital Cities/ABC originally intended to seek a cross-ownership waiver to retain WXYZ and Capital Cities-owned radio stations WJR and WHYT).</h2><h3>In 1984 Thomas Murphy contacted Leonard Goldenson about merging ABC with what company?</h3><p>Capital Cities Communications</p><p>Capital Cities Communications</p><p>Capital Cities Communications</p><h3>How much did Capital Cities Communications purchase ABC and its properties for?</h3><p>$3.5 billion</p><p>$3.5 billion and $118 for each of ABC's shares as well as a guarantee of 10% (or $3) for a total of $121 per share</p><p>$3.5 billion</p><h3>$500 Million was supplied for the Capital City - ABC merger by what investor?</h3><p>Warren Buffett</p><p>Warren Buffett</p><p>Warren Buffett</p><h3>Capital City and ABC sold the WXYZ-TV and WFTS-TV stations to what company?</h3><p>E.

After the ABC/Capital Cities merger was finalized on January 3, 1986, the combined company – which became known as Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. – added four television stations (WPVI-TV/Philadelphia, KTRK-TV/Houston, KFSN-TV/Fresno and WTVD/Raleigh) and several radio stations to ABC's broadcasting portfolio, and also included Fairchild Publications and four newspapers (including The Kansas City Star and Fort Worth Star-Telegram). It also initiated several changes in its management: Frederick S. Pierce was named president of ABC's broadcasting division; Michael P. Millardi became vice president of ABC Broadcasting, and president of ABC Owned Stations and ABC Video Enterprises; John B. Sias was appointed president of the ABC Television Network; Brandon Stoddard became president of ABC Entertainment (a position to which he had been appointed in November 1985); and Roone Arledge became president of ABC News and ABC Sports. In February 1986, Thomas S. Murphy, who had been serving as CEO of Capital Cities since 1964, was appointed chairman and CEO emeritus of ABC. Jim Duffy stepped down as ABC Television president for a management position at ABC Communications, a subsidiary that specialized in community service programming, including shows related to literary education.</h2><h3>When did the merger between ABC and Capital Cities gain federal approval?</h3><p>September 5, 1985</p><p>September 5, 1985</p><p>September 5, 1985</p><h3>After the merger between ABC and Capital Cities was completed, what was the resulting company known as?</h3><p>Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.</p><p>Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.</p><p>Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.</p><h3>After the Capital Cities - ABC merger, Frederick Pierce was named to what position?</h3><p>president of ABC's broadcasting division</p><p>president of ABC's broadcasting division</p><p>president</p><h3>After the merger between ABC and Capital Cities, who became the vice president of ABC broadcasting?</h3><p>Michael P.

After nearly a decade of ratings trouble, NBC had regained the ratings lead among the Big Three networks in 1984 on the success of series such as The Cosby Show, Cheers and Miami Vice. To counteract NBC, ABC decided to refocus itself on comedies and family-oriented series beginning in the mid-1980s including Mr. Belvedere, Roseanne, Who's the Boss?, Just the Ten of Us, The Wonder Years, Full House and Perfect Strangers.</h2><h3>Which sitcom ended its broadcast run for ABC in 1983?</h3><p>Laverne &amp; Shirley</p><p>Laverne &amp; Shirley</p><p>Laverne &amp; Shirley</p><h3>Which sitcom produced a spinoff for ABC after ending its run in 1984?</h3><p>Three's Company</p><p>Three's Company</p><p>Three's Company</p><h3>Which network regained the ratings lead in America in 1984?</h3><p>NBC</p><p>NBC</p><p>NBC</p><h3>What comedy for ABC ended its broadcast run in 1986?</h3><p>The Love Boat</p><p>The Love Boat</p><p>The Love Boat</p><h3>ABC began to focus on what kind of series after NBC's success in 1984?</h3><p>comedies and family-oriented series</p><p>comedies and family-oriented</p><p>comedies and family-oriented</p><h2>Following the initial success of these series, ABC revamped its Friday night schedule around family-friendly comedies in the late 1980s, culminating in the 1989 debut of the &quot;TGIF&quot; block (which promotions referenced stood for &quot;Thank Goodness It's Funny&quot;). Many of the series featured during the run of the block were produced by Miller-Boyett Productions, a Warner Bros.-based studio that briefly programmed the entire Friday lineup during the 1990–91 season (with Going Places joining Family Matters, Full House and Perfect Strangers on the &quot;TGIF&quot; schedule) and through its development deal with Paramount Television prior to 1986 (as Miller-Milkis, and later, Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions), had earlier produced Happy Days and its various spinoffs among other series for the network.</h2><h3>What comedy block debuted in 1989 for ABC?</h3><p>the &quot;TGIF&quot; block</p><p>TGIF</p><p>TGIF</p><h3>What does &quot;TGIF&quot; stand for?</h3><p>Thank Goodness It's Funny</p><p>Thank Goodness It's Funny</p><p>Thank Goodness It's Funny</p><h3>Most of the productions in the TGIF lineup were produced by what production company?</h3><p>Miller-Boyett Productions</p><p>Miller-Boyett Productions</p><p>Miller-Boyett Productions</p><h3>Miller-Boyett Productions was a studio affiliated with what company?</h3><p>Warner Bros.</p><p>Warner Bros.</p><p>Warner Bros</p><h2>In 1968, ABC took advantage of new FCC ownership regulations that allowed broadcasting companies to own a maximum of seven radio stations nationwide in order to purchase Houston radio stations KXYZ and KXYZ-FM for $1 million in shares and $1.5 million in bonds. That year, Roone Arledge was named president of ABC Sports; the company also founded ABC Pictures, a film production company which released its first picture that year, the Ralph Nelson-directed Charly. It was renamed ABC Motion Pictures in 1979; the unit was dissolved in 1985. The studio also operated two subsidiaries, Palomar Pictures International and Selmur Pictures. In July 1968, ABC continued its acquisitions in the amusement parks sector with the opening of ABC Marine World in Redwood City, California; that park was sold in 1972 and demolished in 1986, with the land that occupied the park later becoming home to the headquarters of Oracle Corporation.</h2><h3>New broadcast regulations from the FCC in 1968 allowed companies to own a maximum of how many radio stations?</h3><p>seven radio stations</p><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><h3>What was the first picture released by ABC Pictures?</h3><p>Charly</p><p>Charly</p><p>Charly</p><h3>Who was the film Charly produced by?</h3><p>Ralph Nelson</p><p>Ralph Nelson</p><p>ABC Pictures</p><h3>When was the ABC Pictures division eventually dissolved?</h3><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><h3>Where was ABC Marine World opened?</h3><p>Redwood City, California</p><p>Redwood City, California</p><p>July 1968</p><h2>It was not until the late 1950s that the ABC network became a serious contender to NBC and CBS, and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public, such as westerns and detective series. Despite an almost 500% increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958, the network only had a national reach of between 10% and 18% of the total U.S. population, as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than NBC and CBS. In 1957, ABC Entertainment president Ollie Treiz discovered that the locally produced variety show Bandstand had pulled very strong ratings in the Philadelphia market on WFIL-TV; Treiz ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national, under the revised title American Bandstand; the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to America's youth and helped make a star out of its host, Dick Clark.</h2><h3>What kind of programs can be credited for ABC's success in the late 1950s?</h3><p>westerns and detective series</p><p>westerns and detective series</p><p>westerns and detective series</p><h3>How much did advertising revenue increase for ABC between 1953 and 1958?</h3><p>500%</p><p>almost 500%</p><p>500%</p><h3>What was the national viewership reach of ABC in 1958?</h3><p>between 10% and 18%</p><p>between 10% and 18%</p><p>10% and 18%</p><h3>Who was the ABC Entertainment president in 1957?</h3><p>Ollie Treiz</p><p>Ollie Treiz</p><p>Ollie Treiz</p><h3>Who hosted the bandstand show debuted on ABC in 1957?</h3><p>Dick Clark</p><p>Dick Clark</p><p>Dick Clark</p><h2>These kinds of programs presented ABC with an image of the &quot;philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors&quot;, offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks, which helped Goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television. ABC's western series (as well as series such as the actioner Zorro) went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by NBC and CBS in the fall of 1957, and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959. To captivate the network's audiences, short 66-minute series were scheduled a half-hour before their hour-long competition. In May 1961, Life criticized the public enthusiasm and sponsorship for these types of shows at the expense of news programming and denounced an unofficial law &quot;replacing the good programs with the bad ones&quot;.</h2><h3>What was the programming philosophy pioneered by ABC and Goldenson?</h3><p>counterprogramming</p><p>counterprogramming against its competitors</p><p>&quot;philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors&quot;</p><h3>What ABC action series went up against NBC's variety shows in Fall 1957?</h3><p>Zorro</p><p>Zorro</p><p>Zorro</p><h3>What magazine criticized ABC's programming strategy in May 1961?</h3><p>Life</p><p>Life</p><p>Life</p><h3>What kind of shows were used as counterprogramming by ABC in the Fall of 1959?</h3><p>detective shows</p><p>detective</p><p>detective</p><h2>In May 2013, ABC launched &quot;WATCH ABC&quot;, a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at ABC.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; in addition to providing full-length episodes of ABC programs, the service allows live programming streams of local ABC affiliates in select markets (the first such offering by a U.S. broadcast network).

The ABC logo was also significantly redesigned as part of the transition, with a glossy &quot;ball&quot; effect that was specifically designed for HD.
