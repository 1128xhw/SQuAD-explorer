The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the &quot;10 million dollar millionaires&quot; grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a &quot;silly argument&quot; and &quot;a non-issue . . . a diversion.&quot;</h2><h3>What percentage of global assets does the richest 1% of people have?</h3><p>40%</p><p>40%</p><p>40%</p><p>40</p><h3>According to Oxfam, the 85 richest people have wealth equal to how many average people?</h3><p>about 3.5 billion people</p><p>3.5 billion</p><p>50%</p><p>3.5 billion</p><h3>In order to be considered in the top percentile, a person would need to amass how much money each year?</h3><p>$759,900</p><p>$759,900</p><p>$759,900</p><h3>What has caused Oxfam's findings to be questioned?</h3><p>the methodology used</p><p>basis of the methodology used</p><p>&quot;silly argument&quot; and &quot;a non-issue . . . a diversion.&quot;</p><p>basis of the methodology</p><h3>Why does Oxfam and Credit Suisse believe their findings are being doubted?</h3><p>a diversion</p><p>the basis of the methodology used</p><p>there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China</p><h3>What percent of the global assets in 2000 were owned by just 1% of adults?</h3><p>40%</p><p>40%</p><p>40%</p><p>40</p><h3>What do the three richest people in the world posses more of than the lowest 48 nations together?</h3><p>financial assets</p><p>financial assets</p><p>possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined.</p><p>financial assets</p><h3>How much was the combined wealth of the &quot;10 Million dollar millionaires&quot; in 2008?</h3><p>nearly $41 trillion</p><p>$41 trillion</p><p>the &quot;10 million dollar millionaires&quot; grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008</p><p>$41 trillion</p><h3>How much of the global wealth will the wealthiest 1 percent own by 2016?</h3><p>half</p><p>more than half</p><p>own more than half of the global wealth by 2016</p><p>more than half</p><h3>Why are there more poor people in the United States and Europe than China?</h3><p>greater tendency to take on debts</p><p>greater tendency to take on debts</p><p>greater tendency to take on debts</p><h2>According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans &quot;have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.&quot; According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the &quot;richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent&quot;.

Within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers. In this perspective, wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor (worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord). Thus, in a market economy, inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.</h2><h3>What philosophy of thought  addresses wealth inequality?</h3><p>Neoclassical economics</p><p>Neoclassical economics</p><p>Neoclassical economics</p><h3>What is income inequality attributed to?</h3><p>differences in value added by labor, capital and land</p><p>differences in value added by labor, capital and land</p><p>differences in value added by different classifications of workers</p><h3>What impacts distribution of wealth when evaluating labor?</h3><p>different classifications of workers</p><p>differences in value added by different classifications of workers</p><p>differences in value added by different classifications of workers</p><h3>What is the term that describes the difference between what higher paid and lower paid professionals earn?</h3><p>productivity gap</p><p>productivity gap</p><p>productivity gap</p><h3>How is income determined in a market with variously skilled workers?</h3><p>marginal value added of each economic actor</p><p>differences in value</p><p>marginal value added of each economic actor</p><h3>What did Neoclassical economics view the inequality in the distribution of income as being from?</h3><p>differences in value added by labor, capital and land</p><p>differences in value added by labor, capital and land</p><p>differences in value added by labor, capital and land</p><h3>What is distribution of income from labor due to the differences of?</h3><p>value added by different classifications of workers</p><p>value added by labor, capital and land</p><p>value added</p><h3>What does the marginal value added by an economic actor determine?</h3><p>wages and profits</p><p>wages and profits</p><p>wages and profits</p><h3>What are examples of economic actors?</h3><p>worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord</p><p>worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord</p><p>worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord</p><h3>In a market economy, what is inequality a reflection of?</h3><p>productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions</p><p>productivity gap</p><p>productivity gap</p><h2>In Marxian analysis, capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs (workers) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits. Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the &quot;reserve army of labour&quot;). This process exerts a downward pressure on wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.</h2><h3>What pushes businesses to increase pressures on workers?</h3><p>reduce costs and maximize profits</p><p>substitution of capital equipment for labor</p><p>pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits</p><h3>What impact does workers working harder have on productivity of a business?</h3><p>less workers are required</p><p>raises the productivity of each worker,</p><h3>When less workers are required, what happens to the job market?</h3><p>increasing unemployment</p><p>increasing unemployment</p><p>increasing unemployment</p><h3>What impact does higher worker productivity and leveled pay have on higher earners?</h3><p>rising levels of property income</p><p>rising levels of property income</p><p>downward pressure on wages</p><h3>What do capitalist firms substitute equipment for in a Marxian analysis?</h3><p>labor inputs</p><p>labor inputs (workers)</p><p>labor inputs</p><h3>Why do firms substitute equipment for workers?</h3><p>reduce costs and maximize profits</p><p>to reduce costs and maximize profits</p><p>raises the productivity of each worker</p><h3>What trend increases the organic composition of capital over the long term?</h3><p>substitute capital equipment</p><p>increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs</p><p>pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits</p><h3>What does the substitution of equipment for labor raise for workers?</h3><p>productivity</p><p>organic composition of capital</p><p>productivity</p><h3>What type of wages does mechanization and automation lead to?</h3><p>stagnant</p><p>stagnant wages</p><p>stagnant</p><h2>In a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, inequality is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. &quot;On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers.&quot; &quot;Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.&quot; Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.</h2><h3>What is controled by the market and economy?</h3><p>workers wages</p><p>workers wages</p><p>wages</p><h3>Under what law is value of a worker determined?</h3><p>supply and demand</p><p>law of supply and demand</p><p>supply and demand</p><h3>What happens when business underpays their workers?</h3><p>business is chronically understaffed</p><p>their business is chronically understaffed</p><p>chronically understaffed</p><h3>How do competing businesses attract workers?</h3><p>offering a higher wage</p><p>by offering a higher wage</p><p>offering a higher wage the best of their labor</p><h3>How is income inequality generally viewed by workers?</h3><p>unfair</p><p>unfair</p><p>unfair</p><h3>What controls wages in a purely capitalist mode of production?</h3><p>the market</p><p>market</p><p>market</p><h3>What do wages work in the same way as for any other good?</h3><p>prices</p><p>function of market price of skill</p><p>prices</p><h3>What can be considered as a function of market price of skill?</h3><p>wages</p><p>wages</p><p>wages</p><h3>What can concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society and abuse both workers and consumers?</h3><p>markets</p><p>markets</p><p>markets</p><h3>What type of outcomes can even stable markets lead to?</h3><p>unfair</p><p>high levels of inequality</p><p>high levels of inequality</p><h2>A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.</h2><h3>What has the tendency to increase wages in a field or job position?</h3><p>Competition amongst workers</p><p>high demand</p><p>competition between employers for employees</p><h3>When there are many workers competing for a few jobs its considered as what?</h3><p>low demand</p><p>high supply</p><p>low wage</p><h3>What is the potential earnings for a job where there are few skilled workers but many available positions?</h3><p>high wages</p><p>high wages</p><p>high wages</p><h3>What can lead to higher wages for members of labor organizations?</h3><p>collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption</p><p>collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption</p><p>collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption</p><h3>Who works to get workers higher compensation?</h3><p>Professional and labor organizations</p><p>Professional and labor organizations</p><p>Professional and labor organizations</p><h3>What does many workers willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers result in?</h3><p>low wage</p><p>competition</p><p>low wage</p><h3>What drives down wages in a job with many workers willing to work a lot?</h3><p>competition between workers</p><p>competition</p><p>competition</p><h3>Why does competition among workers drive down wages?</h3><p>expendable nature of the worker</p><p>(high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand)</p><p>the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job</p><h3>What type of wages result from jobs where there is low supply but high demand?</h3><p>high</p><p>high wages</p><p>high</p><h3>While competition between workers drives down wages for jobs with a high supply of worker, whose competition drives wages up for the inverse?</h3><p>employers</p><p>employers</p><p>employers</p><h2>On the other hand, higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level (self-employment). However, most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity. Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter (&quot;push&quot; motivations), whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations (&quot;pull&quot;) such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products, services, or underserved market needs. The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.</h2><h3>What increases with the increase of income inequality?</h3><p>entrepreneurship rates</p><p>entrepreneurship rates</p><p>entrepreneurship rates</p><h3>Survivial is at the heart of what concept for workers?</h3><p>Necessity-based entrepreneurship</p><p>Necessity-based entrepreneurship</p><p>Necessity-based entrepreneurship</p><h3>What type of motivators are food and shelter considered?</h3><p>push</p><p>&quot;push&quot; motivations</p><p>&quot;push&quot;</p><h3>What type of motivators are achievement and self determination considered?</h3><p>pull</p><p>&quot;pull&quot;</p><p>&quot;pull&quot;</p><h3>What type of entrepreneurship leads to advancements in technology?</h3><p>opportunity-based entrepreneurship</p><p>opportunity-based entrepreneurship</p><p>opportunity-based</p><h3>What increases entrepreneurship rates at the individual level?</h3><p>higher economic inequality</p><p>higher economic inequality</p><p>higher economic inequality</p><h3>What is the increased rates of self-employment based on?</h3><p>necessity</p><p>necessity rather than opportunity</p><h3>Survival needs such as income for food and shelter motivates what type of entrepreneurship? </h3><p>Necessity-based</p><p>Necessity-based entrepreneurship</p><p>Necessity-based</p><h3>What motivation is opportunity-based entrepreneurship driven by?</h3><p>achievement-oriented</p><p>achievement-oriented motivations (&quot;pull&quot;)</p><p>achievement-oriented motivations</p><h3>What type of impact does opportunity-based entrepreneurship tend to have on economic growth?</h3><p>positive</p><p>positive</p><p>more positive</p><h2>Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.</h2><h3>What is it called when the tax rate and base amount increase simultaneously?</h3><p>progressive tax</p><p>progressive tax</p><p>progressive</p><h3>What tax rate has a direct relationship with income inequality?</h3><p>top tax rate</p><p>progressive tax</p><p>top</p><h3>What can work to even the distribution of wealth?</h3><p>social spending</p><p>social spending</p><p>steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending</p><h3>What system has an impact on income inequality?</h3><p>tax system</p><p>progressive tax system</p><p>progressive tax</p><h3>In a progressive tax, what increases as the taxable base amount increases?</h3><p>the tax rate</p><p>tax rate</p><p>tax rate</p><h3>What will have a direct impact of inequality in a system that uses a progressive tax?</h3><p>level of the top tax rate</p><p>level of the top tax rate</p><p>top tax rate</p><h3>What can result in more equal distribution of income?</h3><p>steeper tax</p><p>social spending</p><p>steeper tax progressivity</p><h3>What index is an indicator of the effects of taxes applied to social spending?</h3><p>the Gini index</p><p>Gini</p><p>Gini</p><h2>An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education. Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.</h2><h3>What is key to getting the skills needed for high demand jobs?</h3><p>access to education</p><p>Education</p><p>education</p><h3>What do people with lower income have less access to?</h3><p>optional education</p><p>education</p><p>education</p><h3>What does less education lead to when working?</h3><p>lower wages</p><p>lower wages</p><p>lower wages</p><h3>Who has limited productive potential when faced with less access to education?</h3><p>poor</p><p>poor</p><p>poor</p><h3>What are those with lower incomes less likely to have in order to prepare for the future?</h3><p>savings and investment</p><p>education,</p><p>education</p><h3>What is an important factor contributing to inequality for individuals?</h3><p>access to education</p><p>access to education</p><p>access to education</p><h3>What does education in an area where there is high demand for workers tend to create?</h3><p>high wages</p><p>high wages</p><p>high wages</p><h3>What type of wages do people unable to afford an education receive?</h3><p>lower</p><p>lower wages</p><p>lower wages</p><h3>What does lack of education lead directly to?</h3><p>lower incomes</p><p>lower incomes</p><p>lower incomes</p><h3>What helps to unleash the productivity ability of the poor?</h3><p>education</p><p>education</p><p>education</p><h2>In 2014, economists with the Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the U.S.'s wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to boom-and-bust cycles. To partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth, S&amp;P recommended increasing access to education.

High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap. It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries.</h2><h3>When did the high school education movement occur?</h3><p>1910–1940</p><p>1910–1940</p><p>1910–1940</p><h3>What impact did the high school education movement have on the presence of skilled workers?</h3><p>increase</p><p>an increase</p><p>increase</p><h3>What impact did the high school education movement have on the wages of skilled workers?</h3><p>decrease</p><p>decrease in the price of skilled labor</p><p>decrease</p><h3>What impacts gender inequality in wages?</h3><p>gender inequality in education</p><p>gender inequality in education</p><p>education</p><h3>What contributed to the decreased inequality between trained and untrained workers?</h3><p>period of compression</p><p>decrease in wages</p><p>decrease in wages</p><h3>When was the mass high school education movement?</h3><p>from 1910–1940</p><p>1910–1940</p><p>1910–1940</p><h3>What did the increase in skilled workers lead to?</h3><p>a decrease in the price of skilled labor</p><p>decrease in the price of skilled labor</p><p>decrease in the price of skilled labor</p><h3>How did the education during the high school education movement differ from the subsequent high school education?</h3><p>designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work</p><p>designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work</p><p>designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work</p><h3>What is very important for the growth of the economy?</h3><p>Education</p><p>Education</p><p>Education</p><h3>What can result in creating a poverty trap?</h3><p>gender inequality in education</p><p>low economic growth</p><p>continued gender inequality in education</p><h2>John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality.

At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.</h2><h3>What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries?</h3><p>reduced wages</p><p>reduced wages</p><p>reduced wages</p><h3>What effect does trade with richer countries have on the workers in poorer countries?</h3><p>increased wages</p><p>increased wages</p><p>increased wages</p><h3>What has a bigger impact on the United States' economy more than trade?</h3><p>technological innovation</p><p>technological innovation</p><p>technological innovation</p><h3>What has replaced lower skilled workers in the United States?</h3><p>machine labor</p><p>machine labor</p><p>machine labor</p><h3>What scale does trade liberalization shift economic inequality from?</h3><p>global</p><p>global</p><p>global</p><h3>When rich countries trade with poor countries, whose wages increase?</h3><p>workers in the poor countries</p><p>low-skilled workers in the poor countries</p><p>poor</p><h3>What does Paul Krugmen think has had an observable effect on inequality in the U.S.?</h3><p>trade liberalisation</p><p>trade liberalisation</p><p>trade liberalisation</p><h3>Compared to other causes, the effect of trade on inequality in America is what?</h3><p>minor</p><p>minor</p><p>minor</p><h3>What has technological innovation and automation replaced low-skilled jobs with?</h3><p>machine labor</p><p>machine labor</p><p>machine labor</p><h2>In many countries, there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market. Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference. A U.S. Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men. The income gap in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain.</h2><h3>What is the income inequality gap between genders in Botswana?</h3><p>53%</p><p>53%</p><p>53%</p><h3>What is the gender income inequality in Bahrain?</h3><p>-40%</p><p>-40%</p><p>-40%</p><h3>What is attributed to the income inequality in the United States?</h3><p>less willing to travel or relocate</p><p>women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy</p><p>not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy</p><h3>Who does the wage gap between genders provide an advantage?</h3><p>males</p><p>males</p><p>males</p><h3>In many countries, what kind of pay gap is there?</h3><p>Gender</p><p>ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain</p><p>Gender</p><h3>Who does a gender pay gap tend to favor?</h3><p>males in the labor market</p><p>males</p><p>males</p><h3>What gender is less willing to travel or relocate for work?</h3><p>women</p><p>women</p><p>women</p><h3>Who is the author of the book, &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;?</h3><p>Thomas Sowell</p><p>Thomas Sowell</p><p>Thomas Sowell</p><h3>What does a U.S. census report state that even after other factors there still exists this between earnings of men and women?</h3><p>a difference</p><p>difference</p><p>difference in earnings</p><h2>Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development. According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth. As a country develops, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality. Eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.</h2><h3>What types of programs help to redistribute wealth?</h3><p>social welfare</p><p>social welfare</p><p>social welfare</p><h3>What is the level of inequality in underdeveloped countries?</h3><p>relatively equal</p><p>relatively equal distributions of wealth</p><p>low</p><h3>What introduces inequality to a country?</h3><p>more capital</p><p>more capital</p><p>more capital</p><h3>What leads to lower income inequality?</h3><p>redistribution mechanisms</p><p>redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs</p><p>redistribution mechanisms</p><h3>What profession does Simon Kuznets have?</h3><p>Economist</p><p>Economist</p><p>Economist</p><h3>What did Kuznets argue resulted from stages of development?</h3><p>levels of economic inequality</p><p>economic inequality</p><p>economic inequality</p><h3>What does a country acquire as it develops?</h3><p>more capital</p><p>more capital</p><p>more capital</p><h3>What do the owners of more capital end up having?</h3><p>more wealth</p><p>more wealth and income</p><p>wealth and income</p><h3>What do redistribution mechanisms lead to?</h3><p>lower levels of inequality</p><p>lower levels of inequality</p><p>lower levels of inequality</p><h2>Plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality, Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve. Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s. This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory.[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.</h2><h3>During what time period did income inequality decrease in the United States?</h3><p>1910 to 1940</p><p>1910 to 1940</p><p>1910 to 1940</p><h3>When did income inequality begin to increase in the US?</h3><p>1970s</p><p>1970s</p><p>1970s</p><h3>In what sector are jobs beginning to increase?</h3><p>service</p><p>service</p><h3>In what sector are jobs beginning to decrease?</h3><p>manufacturing</p><p>manufacturing</p><h3>Who plotted the relationships between levels of income and inequality?</h3><p>Kuznets</p><p>Kuznets</p><p>Kuznets</p><h3>What is a a developing economy's level of inequality bulging out called?</h3><p>Kuznets curve</p><p>Kuznets curve</p><p>Kuznets curve</p><h3>What has recent testing of Kuznets theory with superior data show it to be?</h3><p>very weak</p><p>very weak</p><p>very weak</p><h3>What does Kuznets' curve predict about income inequality given time?</h3><p>eventually decrease</p><p>eventually decrease</p><p>decrease</p><h3>What may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in at any given time?</h3><p>effect</p><p>in effect</p><p>effect</p><h2>Wealth concentration is a theoretical[according to whom?] process by which, under certain conditions, newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities. According to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. Over time, wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society. Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [pp. 384 Table 12.2, U.S. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return]</h2><h3>What process attributes new wealth to those that already have it?</h3><p>Wealth concentration</p><p>Wealth concentration</p><p>Wealth concentration</p><h3>According to the wealth concentration theory, what advantage do the wealthy have in accumulating new wealth?</h3><p>means to invest</p><p>the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth</p><p>means to invest in new sources of creating wealth</p><h3>What has the highest impact on wealth accumulation and the resulting income inequality?</h3><p>greater return of capital</p><p>wealth condensation</p><p>wealth condensation</p><h3>What tends to lead to more money?</h3><p>larger fortunes</p><p>wealth condensation</p><p>wealth</p><h3>Where does newly created wealth concentrate? </h3><p>the possession of already-wealthy individuals</p><p>in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities</p><p>already-wealthy individuals</p><h3>Who is best able to leverage the accumulation of wealth?</h3><p>those who already hold wealth</p><p>those who already hold wealth</p><p>those who already hold wealth</p><h3>What can significantly contribute to the continuing inequality in a society over time?</h3><p>wealth condensation</p><p>wealth condensation</p><p>wealth condensation</p><h3>Who wrote the book &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot;?</h3><p>Thomas Piketty</p><p>Thomas Piketty</p><p>Thomas Piketty</p><h3>What do larger fortunes generate?</h3><p>higher returns</p><p>higher returns</p><p>higher returns</p><h2>Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as &quot;rent-seeking&quot;. While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them. This process, known to economists as rent-seeking, brings income not from creation of wealth but from &quot;grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort&quot;</h2><h3>What forces should serve as a brake on wealth concentration?</h3><p>market</p><p>market forces</p><p>market</p><h3>What career does Joseph Stiglitz have?</h3><p>Economist</p><p>Economist</p><p>Economist</p><h3>What type of skills does the market bid up compensation for?</h3><p>rare and desired</p><p>rare and desired skills</p><p>rare and desired skills</p><h3>What is used by certain wealthy groups to obtain policies financially beneficial for them?</h3><p>political power generated by wealth</p><p>political power</p><p>political power</p><h3>Income not from the creation of wealth but by grabbing a larger share of it is know to economists by what term?</h3><p>rent-seeking</p><p>rent-seeking</p><h2>Effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems, and lower rates of social goods, a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption, and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption.

High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict.

Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality, than in countries (US and UK) and states (Mississippi and New York) with large differences in household income.</h2><h3>What nationality are researchers Richard G.

Americans live no longer on average (about 77 years in 2004) than Greeks (78 years) or New Zealanders (78), though the USA has a higher GDP per capita.

Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions. There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger. Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries, as well as studying areas within countries. Daly et al. 2001 found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality. They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) found a similar relationship worldwide.

A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced &quot;distributive efficiency&quot; within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (&quot;the additional dollar&quot;) decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.</h2><h3>What does the utilitarian principle seek for the greatest number of people?</h3><p>the greatest good</p><p>greatest good</p><p>good</p><h3>An adobe that provides less utility to one person than another is an example of reduced what?</h3><p>distributive efficiency</p><p>distributive efficiency</p><p>&quot;distributive efficiency&quot;</p><h3>A dollar spent by a poor person is likely to provide what for them?</h3><p>a great deal of utility</p><p>a great deal of utility</p><p>basic necessities</p><h3>What the marginal utility of wealth per income per person do as that person becomes richer?</h3><p>decreases</p><p>decreases</p><p>decreases</p><h3>What will a society with more equality have?</h3><p>higher aggregate utility</p><p>population-wide satisfaction and happiness</p><p>satisfaction and happiness</p><h2>Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption, rather than income should be the measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US. Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that &quot;the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality,&quot; and consumption is more important than income. According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986. The debate is summarized in &quot;The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor&quot; by journalist Thomas B. Edsall. Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality, and the CBO's study found consumption data not &quot;adequately&quot; capturing &quot;consumption by high-income households&quot; as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.</h2><h3>What do conservative researchers fell should be a measure of inequality?</h3><p>consumption</p><p>consumption</p><p>consumption</p><h3>What political leaning does the Cato Institute have?</h3><p>libertarian</p><p>libertarian</p><p>libertarian</p><h3>When was consumption inequality lower than it had been in 1986?</h3><p>2001</p><p>2001</p><p>2001</p><h3>Who wrote &quot;The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor&quot;?</h3><p>Thomas B.

Moreover, Piketty argues that the &quot;magical&quot; Kuznets curve hypothesis, with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run, cannot account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s.</h2><h3>What have studies on income inequality sometimes found evidence confirming?</h3><p>Kuznets curve hypothesis</p><p>Kuznets curve hypothesis</p><p>Kuznets curve hypothesis</p><h3>The Kuznets curve says with economic development, inequality will decrease after what?</h3><p>first increases</p><p>inequality first increases</p><p>increases</p><h3>Who challenges the notion of the Kuznets curve hypothesis?</h3><p>Thomas Piketty</p><p>Thomas Piketty</p><p>Thomas Piketty</p><h3>What's Thomas Piketty's job?</h3><p>Economist</p><p>Economist</p><p>Economist</p><h3>What does Piketty feel was the biggest factors in reducing inequality between 1914 to 1945?</h3><p>wars and &quot;violent economic and political shocks&quot;</p><p>violent economic and political shocks</p><p>wars and &quot;violent economic and political shocks&quot;</p><h2>Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high inequality have &quot;succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years&quot; but &quot;longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.&quot;</h2><h3>When were theories developed suggesting inequality may have some positive effect on economic development?</h3><p>the 1970s</p><p>1970s</p><p>1970s</p><h3>According to a 1955 review, what were savings by the wealthy thought to offset?</h3><p>reduced consumer demand</p><p>reduced consumer demand</p><p>reduced consumer demand</p><h3>What does a 2013 report on Nigeria suggest it's growth has done?</h3><p>risen with increased income inequality</p><p>risen</p><p>risen</p><h3>How long does it take for the effects to manifest as changes to economic growth?</h3><p>several years</p><p>several years</p><p>several years</p><h3>What are longer growth spells associated with?</h3><p>more equality in the income distribution</p><p>more equality</p><p>equality in the income distribution</p><h2>While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth. The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality. For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction. In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon: &quot;While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.&quot;</h2><h3>What needs to be made to ensure poorer members of society can participate in economic growth?</h3><p>special efforts</p><p>special efforts</p><p>special efforts</p><h3>What can the growth elasticity of poverty depend on?</h3><p>existing level of inequality</p><p>existing level of inequality</p><p>existing level of inequality</p><h3>What does it take a country with high inequality longer to achieve?</h3><p>reduction</p><p>halve poverty</p><p>halve poverty</p><h3>What was Ban Ki-Moon the Secretary General of?</h3><p>the United Nations</p><p>United Nations</p><p>United Nations</p><h3>What isn't economic growth sufficient for progress on?</h3><p>reducing poverty</p><p>reducing poverty</p><p>reducing poverty</p><h2>In many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system. Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements. Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building, In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land. Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency.</h2><h3>What is held outside the formal legal ownership registration system in many developing countries?</h3><p>much land and housing</p><p>land and housing</p><p>land and housing</p><h3>How is unregistered property held in informal form?</h3><p>through various associations and other arrangements</p><p>through various associations and other arrangements</p><p>through various associations</p><h3>Excessive bureaucratic red tape is one of the reasons for what type of ownership?</h3><p>extra-legal</p><p>extra-legal</p><p>extra-legal</p><h3>In some countries over how many steps can it take to build on government land?</h3><p>200</p><p>200</p><p>200</p><h3>What can it sometimes take up to 14 years to get permission to build on?</h3><p>government land</p><p>government land</p><p>government land</p><h2>A number of researchers (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.</h2><h3>What do a number of researchers think a shortage of is caused in part by income inequality?</h3><p>a shortage of affordable housing</p><p>affordable housing</p><p>affordable housing</p><h3>What decreased in number between 1984 and 1991?</h3><p>quality rental units</p><p>quality rental units</p><p>quality rental units</p><h3>Why did the demand for rentals decrease?</h3><p>demand for higher quality housing increased</p><p>demand for higher quality housing increased</p><p>demand for higher quality housing increased</p><h3>What drove increased rental prices in East New York?</h3><p>residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing</p><p>gentrification of older neighbourhoods</p><p>new residents willing to pay higher market rate</p><h3>What combined with ricing prices to make it difficult or impossible for poor people to keep pace?</h3><p>ad valorem property tax policy</p><p>ad valorem property tax policy</p><p>property tax policy</p><h2>Firstly, certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care. If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.</h2><h3>How are the certain costs which are difficult to avoid shared?</h3><p>by everyone</p><p>by everyone</p><h3>What are those with lower incomes often unable to manage?</h3><p>their finances</p><p>finances</p><p>finances</p><h3>What is the term when middle income earners aspire to obtain the same standards of living as people wealthier than themselves?</h3><p>aspirational consumption</p><p>aspirational consumption</p><p>aspirational consumption</p><h3>What is one method of achieving aspirational consumption?</h3><p>taking on debt</p><p>taking on debt</p><p>taking on debt</p><h3>When people take on debt, it leads potentially to what?</h3><p>economic instability</p><p>greater inequality and potential economic instability</p><p>greater inequality and potential economic instability</p><h2>The smaller the economic inequality, the more waste and pollution is created, resulting in many cases, in more environmental degradation. This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions. This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).[not in citation given] It should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well. If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage.</h2><h3>When economic inequality is smaller, more waste and pollution is?</h3><p>created</p><p>created</p><p>created</p><p>created</p><h3>What would be lower if there were fewer people?</h3><p>emissions per person</p><p>this multiplier</p><p>environmental degradation</p><p>environmental degradation</p><h3>What does the current high level of population have a large impact on?</h3><p>environmental degradation</p><p>this as well</p><p>environmental degradation</p><p>environmental degradation</p><h3>How could human inequality be addressed without resulting in an increase of environmental damage?</h3><p>If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level</p><p>If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level</p><p>population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level</p><p>population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level</p><h2>Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product.</h2><h3>What is the vast disparities in wealth attributed to by Socialists?</h3><p>private ownership of the means of production</p><p>private ownership of the means of production</p><p>private ownership of the means of production</p><h3>What does private ownership create a situation of?</h3><p>a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income</p><p>small portion of the population lives off unearned property income</p><p>small portion of the population lives off unearned property income</p><h3>What type of income is the vast majority of the population dependent on?</h3><p>wage or salary</p><p>wage or salary</p><p>wage or salary</p><h3>How do socialists think the means of production should be owned?</h3><p>socially</p><p>socially</p><p>socially</p><h3>What would income differentials be if individual contributions were relevant to the social product?</h3><p>reflective</p><p>reflective</p><p>reflective of individual contributions</p><h2>Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force. However, Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property, and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves. John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members. Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice. Some see Rawls's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism; others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls's theory of justice.</h2><h3>Who argues that the government redistributes wealth by force?</h3><p>Robert Nozick</p><p>Robert Nozick</p><p>Robert Nozick</p><h3>What is the usual form of the government's wealth redistribution? </h3><p>taxation</p><p>taxation</p><p>taxation</p><h3>In an ideal moral society, what would all citizens be free from?</h3><p>force</p><p>force</p><h3>How were some modern economic inequalities created?</h3><p>forceful taking of property</p><p>forceful taking of property</p><p>forceful taking of property</p><h3>When are inequalities in wealth justified, according to John Rawls?</h3><p>when they improve society as a whole</p><p>when they improve society as a whole</p><p>when they improve society as a whole</p><h2>The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “capability deprivation”. Unlike neoliberalism, which “defines well-being as utility maximization”, economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself. Its goal is to “wid[en] people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being” through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).</h2><h3>What does the capabilities approach look at poverty as a form of?</h3><p>capability deprivation</p><p>capability deprivation</p><p>“capability deprivation”</p><h3>In the capabilities approach, grow and income are considered a means to an end rather than what?</h3><p>the end itself</p><p>the end itself</p><p>the end itself</p><h3>What is the goal of the capabilities approach?</h3><p>to “wid[en] people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being”</p><p>wid[en] people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being</p><p>“wid[en] people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being”</p><h3>How would the capabilities approach achieve it's goal?</h3><p>through increasing functionings</p><p>increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals)</p><p>through increasing functionings</p><h3>What is the definition of agency as it relates to capabilities? </h3><p>the ability to pursue valued goals</p><p>the ability to pursue valued goals</p><h2>When a person’s capabilities are lowered, they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise. An old, ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home. There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives. As a result, income and economic inequality increases, and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid. To prevent such inequality, this approach believes it’s important to have political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security to ensure that people aren’t denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.</h2><h3>What happens when a person's capabilities aer lowered, as it relates to their income?</h3><p>deprived of earning as much</p><p>deprived of earning as much income</p><p>deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise</p><h3>What can and old, ill man not do?</h3><p>earn as much as a healthy young man</p><p>earn as much as a healthy young man</p><p>earn as much as a healthy young man</p><h3>What issues may prevent women from working outside the home or receiving education?</h3><p>gender roles and customs</p><p>gender roles and customs</p><p>gender roles and customs</p><h3>Why would rampant violence prevent people from going to work?</h3><p>for fear of their lives</p><p>fear of their lives</p><p>fear of their lives</p><h3>What can people work towards if they aren't denied their functionings, capabilities and agency?</h3><p>a better relevant income.</p><p>better relevant income</p><p>a better relevant income</p></div></body></html>
