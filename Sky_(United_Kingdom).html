<html><body><div><h1>Sky_(United_Kingdom)</h1><h2>Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting, BSkyB became the UK's largest digital subscription television company. Following BSkyB's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04% interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014, its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc. The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited, still trading as Sky.</h2><h3>What company was formed by the merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting?</h3><p>BSkyB</p><p>BSkyB</p><p>BSkyB</p><h3>Who is the UK's largest digital subscription television company?</h3><p>BSkyB</p><p>BSkyB</p><p>BSkyB</p><h3>What year did BSkyB acquire Sky Italia?</h3><p>2014</p><p>2014</p><p>2014</p><h3>What is the name of the holding company for BSkyB?</h3><p>Sky plc</p><p>British Sky Broadcasting Group plc</p><p>British Sky Broadcasting Group plc</p><h3>What is the name of the United Kingdom operation for BSkyB?</h3><p>Sky UK Limited</p><p>Sky UK Limited</p><p>Sky UK Limited</p><h2>Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season. In May 2006, the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters. Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn. In February 2015, Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016. This represented an increase of 70% on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay. The move has been followed by staff cuts, increased subscription prices (including 9% in Sky's family package) and the dropping of the 3D channel.</h2><h3>What year was Setanta Sports awarded Primeier Leage rights to broadcast?</h3><p>2006</p><p>2006</p><p>2006</p><h3>How many of the six total packages available to broadcasters was Setanta awarded?</h3><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><h3>Who purhcased the remaining 4 pacakages available to broadcasters?</h3><p>Sky</p><p>Sky</p><p>Sky</p><h3>How much did Sky bid to win the 4 broadcast pacakges they bought?</h3><p>£1.3bn</p><p>£1.3bn</p><p>£4.2bn</p><h2>While BSkyB had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium, thereby making them a competitor by default, BSkyB was able to join ITV Digital's free-to-air replacement, Freeview, in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless. Prior to October 2005, three BSkyB channels were available on this platform: Sky News, Sky Three, and Sky Sports News. Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service. However, this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005, which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV' in 2011.</h2><h3>What consortium was BSkyB excluded from?</h3><p>ONdigital</p><p>ONdigital</p><p>ONdigital</p><h3>Who did BSkyB team up with because it was not part of the consortium?</h3><p>Freeview</p><p>ITV Digital</p><p>ITV Digital</p><h3>How many BSkyB channels were available to customers prior to October 2005?</h3><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><h3>What channel replaced Sky Travel?</h3><p>Sky Three</p><p>Sky Three</p><p>Sky Three</p><h3>What was Sky Travel later rebranded as?</h3><p>Pick TV</p><p>Pick TV</p><p>Pick TV</p><h2>BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels. This changed as from 1 July 2007, and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge. Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality. In September 2007, Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women. As of 31 March 2008, Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users.</h2><h3>What service did BSkyB chare additional subscription fees for?</h3><p>Sky+ PVR</p><p>Sky+ PVR</p><p>Sky+ PVR</p><h3>When did Sky launch a TV advertising campaign target towards women?</h3><p>September 2007</p><p>September 2007</p><p>March 2008</p><h3>WHat allows customers to get Sky+ functions if they do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels?</h3><p>monthly fee</p><p>a monthly fee</p><p>SkyHD box</p><h3>When did BSkyB discontinue the Sky+ Box?</h3><p>January 2010</p><p>In January 2010</p><p>February 2011</p><h3>What replaced the Sky+Box?</h3><p>Sky+HD Box</p><p>Sky+HD Box</p><p>Sky+HD Box</p><h2>BSkyB utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS, a Cisco Systems company.

The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007. Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels, a claim which BSkyB denied, on the basis that their new deal offered &quot;substantially more value&quot; by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable.</h2><h3>What channels were removed from the network in March of 2007?</h3><p>basic channels</p><p>the basic channels</p><p>the basic channels</p><h3>What year did BSkyB and Virgin Media have a dispute over the carriage of Sky Channels on cable TV?</h3><p>2007</p><p>2007</p><p>2007</p><h3>What did Virgin Media claim BSkyB did that resulted Virgin not carrying the channels anymore?</h3><p>substantially increased the asking price</p><p>that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels</p><p>increased the asking price</p><h3>What additional srevice did BSkyB offer besides HD channels that they claimed offered &quot;substantially more value&quot;?</h3><p>Video On Demand</p><p>Video On Demand content</p><p>HD channels and Video On Demand</p><h3>What additional srevice did BSkyB offer besides Video on Demand that they claimed offered &quot;substantially more value&quot;?</h3><p>HD channels</p><p>HD channels</p><p>HD channels</p><h2>In July 2013, the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft’s use of the term &quot;SkyDrive&quot; infringed on Sky’s right to the &quot;Sky&quot; trademark.

The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels. The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform. Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package. Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994. Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage, mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels.</h2><h3>Who was the chief executive officer when the service began?</h3><p>Sam Chisholm</p><p>Sam Chisholm</p><p>Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch</p><h3>Who's satellites would the new free-to-air channels be broadcast from?</h3><p>Astra</p><p>Astra's</p><p>Astra's satellites</p><h3>When did BSkyB end their analogue service?</h3><p>27 September 2001</p><p>27 September 2001</p><p>September 2001</p><h3>What platform caused BSkyB to end their analogue service?</h3><p>Sky Digital</p><p>Sky Digital</p><p>Sky Digital platform</p><h3>How many households had BSkyB service in 1994?</h3><p>3.5 million</p><p>3.5 million</p><p>3.5 million</p><h2>Sky UK Limited (formerly British Sky Broadcasting or BSkyB) is a British telecommunications company which serves the United Kingdom.

ITV were the current rights holders, and fought hard to retain the new rights. ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights. BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid. The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights, would give them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992 season.  Murdoch described sport as a &quot;battering ram&quot; for pay-television, providing a strong customer base. A few weeks after the deal, ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken. ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal. A few days later neither action took effect, ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid, and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid.</h2><h3>When were the talks held for braodcast right to the Primier league for a five year period from the 1992 season?</h3><p>1991</p><p>autumn of 1991</p><p>1991</p><h3>Who were the current rights holders for the Primer League?</h3><p>ITV</p><p>ITV</p><p>ITV</p><h3>What did ITV increase their yearly offer for control of the rights to broadcast the Primer League to?</h3><p>£34m</p><p>£34m</p><p>£34m per year</p><h3>Who was given the highlights of most of the matches?</h3><p>BBC</p><p>The BBC</p><p>BBC</p><h3>How much was BSkyB going to pay for the Primier League rights?</h3><p>£304m</p><p>£304m</p><p>£304m</p><h2>BSkyB has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from Ofcom.
