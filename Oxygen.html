It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O
2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.</h2><h3>The atomic number of the periodic table for oxygen?</h3><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><h3>What is the second most abundant element?</h3><p>helium</p><p>helium</p><p>helium</p><p>helium</p><p>helium</p><h3>How many atoms combine to form dioxygen?</h3><p>two atoms</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><h3>Roughly, how much oxygen makes up the Earth crust?</h3><p>almost half</p><p>almost half</p><p>half</p><p>almost half</p><p>half</p><h3>Which gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere?</h3><p>Diatomic oxygen</p><p>Diatomic oxygen</p><p>Diatomic oxygen gas</p><p>Diatomic oxygen</p><p>Diatomic oxygen gas</p><h3>How much of the earth's atmosphere is diatomic oxygen?</h3><p>20.8%</p><p>20.8%</p><p>20.8%</p><p>20.8%</p><p>20.8%</p><h3>What element makes up almost half of the earth's crust by mass?</h3><p>Oxygen</p><p>Oxygen</p><p>Oxygen</p><p>Oxygen</p><p>Oxygen</p><h3>What is the atomic number for oxygen?</h3><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><h3>Are atmospheric oxygen levels going up, down, or staying the same?</h3><p>monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend</p><p>down</p><p>down</p><p>down</p><p>downward</p><h3>What are the three most abundent elements of the universe by mass?</h3><p>By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium</p><p>oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium</p><p>oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium</p><p>oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium</p><p>By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.</p><h3>What is the atomic number of the element oxygen?</h3><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><h3>Of what group in the periodic table is oxygen a member?</h3><p>chalcogen</p><p>chalcogen</p><p>chalcogen</p><p>chalcogen</p><p>the chalcogen group</p><h3>What type of compounds does oxygen most commonly form?</h3><p>oxides</p><p>oxides</p><p>oxides</p><p>oxide compounds</p><p>oxide</p><h3>Compared to other elements, how abundant does oxygen rank?</h3><p>third</p><p>third-most</p><p>third</p><p>third-most</p><p>third</p><h3>Under normal conditions, what do two atoms of oxygen form?</h3><p>dioxygen</p><p>diatomic gas</p><p>dioxygen</p><p>dioxygen</p><p>dioxygen</p><h2>Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water. It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O
3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog. At even higher low earth orbit altitudes, sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft.</h2><h3>Oxygen is released in cellular respiration by?</h3><p>photosynthesis</p><p>photosynthesis</p><p>photosynthesis</p><p>photosynthesis</p><p>photosynthesis</p><h3>Photosynthesis uses which energy to for oxygen from water?</h3><p>sunlight</p><p>sunlight</p><p>sunlight</p><p>the energy of sunlight</p><p>sunlight</p><h3>_____ Helps the biospher from UV.</h3><p>high-altitude ozone layer</p><p>ozone</p><p>ozone layer</p><p>ozone</p><h3>What element is found in most organic organisms?</h3><p>oxygen</p><p>oxygen</p><p>oxygen</p><p>oxygen</p><p>oxygen</p><h3>In what major portion of living things is oxygen found?</h3><p>water</p><p>water</p><p>organic molecules</p><p>inorganic compounds</p><p>mass</p><h3>What life process produces oxygen in the presence of light?</h3><p>photosynthesis</p><p>living organisms</p><p>photosynthesis</p><p>photosynthesis</p><p>photosynthesis</p><h3>From what does photosynthesis get oxygen?</h3><p>water</p><p>water</p><p>water</p><p>water</p><p>water</p><h3>What form of oxygen is composed of three oxygen atoms?</h3><p>ozone</p><p>ozone</p><p>ozone</p><p>ozone</p><h2>In the late 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.</h2><h3>Who proved that air is necessary for combustion?</h3><p>Robert Boyle</p><p>Robert Boyle</p><p>Boyle</p><p>Robert Boyle</p><h3>What English chemist showed that fire only needed nitoaereus?</h3><p>John Mayow</p><p>John Mayow</p><p>Mayow</p><p>John Mayow</p><h3>What is consumed in both combustion and respiration?</h3><p>nitroaereus</p><p>nitroaereus</p><p>nitroaereus</p><p>nitroaereus</p><h3>John Mayow died in what year?</h3><p>1679</p><p>1679</p><p>1679</p><p>1679</p><h3>What researcher showed that air is a necessity for combustion?</h3><p>Robert Boyle</p><p>Robert Boyle</p><p>Boyle</p><p>Robert Boyle</p><h3>What did John Mayow  name the part of air that caused combustion?</h3><p>nitroaereus</p><p>spiritus nitroaereus</p><p>spiritus nitroaereus</p><p>spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus</p><h3>In what century did Mayow and Boyle perform their experiments?</h3><p>17th century</p><p>17th</p><p>17th</p><p>late 17th century</p><h3>Besides combustion, for what other action did Mayow show nitroaereus responsible?</h3><p>respiration</p><p>respiration</p><p>respiration</p><p>respiration</p><h3>What chemist showed that fire needed only a part of air?</h3><p>John Mayow</p><p>John Mayow</p><p>Mayow</p><p>John Mayow</p><h2>In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot;.

After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: &quot;The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.&quot; Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled &quot;An Account of Further Discoveries in Air&quot; which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.

2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O
2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O
4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O
2 to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O
8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O
2 or O
3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel. A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures, this phase becomes superconducting.</h2><h3>What is the name for O3 most often used?</h3><p>ozone</p><p>ozone</p><p>ozone</p><p>Trioxygen</p><p>Ozone</p><h3>Of what is ozone a reactive part of oxygen?</h3><p>allotrope</p><p>allotrope</p><p>allotrope</p><p>allotrope</p><p>allotrope</p><h3>What  does ozone's characteristic to cause damage effect?</h3><p>lung tissue</p><p>lung tissue</p><p>lung tissue</p><p>lung</p><p>lung tissue</p><h3>What function does ozone perform for the planet?</h3><p>protective radiation shield</p><p>protective radiation shield</p><p>protective radiation shield</p><p>radiation shield</p><p>a protective radiation shield</p><h3>What light radiation does ozone absorb?</h3><p>UV</p><p>ultraviolet</p><p>UV</p><p>ultraviolet (UV)</p><p>ultraviolet</p><h2>The common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen, O

2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O
2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O

Pulling on the masks &quot;to start the flow of oxygen&quot; as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister. A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.</h2><h3>What event would necessitate airline passengers to need a supplemental supply of oxygen? </h3><p>cabin depressurization</p><p>cabin depressurization</p><p>cabin depressurization</p><p>cabin depressurization</p><p>depressurization</p><h3>What is the type of oxygen production for emergency oxygen in airlines?</h3><p>chemical</p><p>chemical oxygen</p><p>chemical</p><p>chemical oxygen generators</p><p>chemical</p><h3>What type of reaction is present in the emergency oxygen generator of an airplane?</h3><p>exothermic</p><p>exothermic</p><p>exothermic</p><p>exothermic</p><p>exothermic reaction</p><h3>What gas does the airline exothermic reaction produce?</h3><p>oxygen gas</p><p>oxygen</p><p>oxygen</p><p>oxygen</p><p>oxygen</p><h2>Oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds.

Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.</h2><h3>What do oxygen tanks, cryogenics, and chemical compounds serve as for oxygen?</h3><p>storage</p><p>storage</p><p>storage methods</p><p>storage</p><p>storage methods</p><h3>By what means is bulk oxygen shipped?</h3><p>insulated tankers</p><p>insulated tankers</p><p>insulated tankers</p><p>specially insulated tankers</p><h3>In what state is oxygen shipped in bulk?</h3><p>liquid</p><p>as a liquid</p><p>liquid</p><p>as a liquid in specially insulated tankers</p><h3>In what form is oxygen transported in smaller containers?</h3><p>compressed gas</p><p>compressed gas</p><p>compressed gas;</p><p>compressed gas</p><p>compressed gas</p><h3>What type of organization would need large quantities of pure oxygen?</h3><p>hospitals</p><p>hospitals</p><p>hospitals</p><p>hospitals</p><p>hospitals</p><h2>Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where &quot;R&quot; is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides (R-C(O)-NR
