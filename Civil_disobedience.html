<html><body><div><h1>Civil_disobedience</h1><h2>One of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution. Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments, In South Africa in the fight against apartheid, in the American Civil Rights Movement, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide.</h2><h3>What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?</h3><p>Civil disobedience</p><p>Civil disobedience</p><p>Civil disobedience</p><p>Civil disobedience</p><p>Civil disobedience</p><h3>What is an example of major civil disobedience in South Africa?</h3><p>apartheid</p><p>fight against apartheid</p><p>the fight against apartheid</p><p>the fight against apartheid</p><p>Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries</p><h3>What was the the movement called that brought Baltic countries independence from the Soviet Union?</h3><p>Singing Revolution</p><p>Singing Revolution</p><p>the Singing Revolution</p><p>Singing Revolution</p><p>Singing Revolution</p><h3>In 2004 the Orange revolution occurred in what country?</h3><p>Ukraine</p><p>Ukraine</p><p>Ukraine</p><p>Ukraine</p><p>Ukraine</p><h3>Where was the location of the 2003 Rose revolution?</h3><p>Georgia</p><p>Georgia</p><p>Georgia</p><p>Georgia</p><p>Georgia</p><h3>Which people brought forward one of the earliest examples of Civil Disobedience?</h3><p>Egyptians</p><p>Egyptians</p><p>Egyptians</p><p>Egyptians</p><p>India</p><h3>Who was one of the earliest examples of Civil Disobedience against?</h3><p>the British</p><p>British</p><p>Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution.</p><p>British occupation</p><p>communist governments</p><h3>Why do people chose civil disobedience to protest?</h3><p>nonviolent resistance</p><p>unfair laws</p><p>nonviolent resistance movements</p><p>rebelled against what they deem to be unfair</p><h3>What does civil disobedience protest against?</h3><p>unfair laws</p><p>unfair laws</p><p>unfair laws.</p><p>unfair laws</p><p>what they deem to be unfair</p><h3>What civil rights movement in the US was known for it's disobedience?</h3><p>American Civil Rights Movement</p><p>American Civil Rights Movement</p><p>American Civil Rights Movement</p><p>Civil Rights Movement</p><p>American Civil Rights Movement</p><h2>One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles' play Antigone, in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial. She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.</h2><h3>Sophocles demonstrated civil disobedience in a play that was called?</h3><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><h3>Who is Antigone's father in the play?</h3><p>former King of Thebes</p><p>Oedipus</p><p>Oedipus</p><p>Oedipus</p><p>King of Thebes</p><h3>What is the name of the current King of Thebes in the play?</h3><p>Creon</p><p>Creon</p><p>Creon</p><p>Creon</p><p>Creon</p><h3>What character in the play portrays civil disobedience?</h3><p>Oedipus</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><h3>What is Creon trying to stop Antigone from doing in the play? </h3><p>giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><p>trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><p>giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><p>giving her brother Polynices a proper burial.</p><p>from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><h3>What play showed an early depiction of civil disobedience?</h3><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><p>Antigone</p><h3>Antigone was a play made by whom?</h3><p>Sophocles</p><p>Sophocles</p><p>Sophocles</p><p>Sophocles</p><p>Sophocles</p><h3>In Antigone, who was the target of civil disobedience?</h3><p>Creon, the current King of Thebes</p><p>Creon</p><p>Creon, the current King of Thebes</p><p>Creon</p><p>Creon</p><h3>What was the protest in Antigone about?</h3><p>giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><p>giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><p>the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><p>Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><p>giving her brother Polynices a proper burial</p><h3>How was the civil disobedience shown in Antigone?</h3><p>obey her conscience rather than human law</p><p>She gives a stirring speech</p><p>She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law</p><p>a stirring speech</p><p>She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law</p><h2>Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819, poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. It is perhaps the first modern[vague] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha. Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.</h2><h3>After the Peterloo massacre what poet wrote The Massacre of Anarchy?</h3><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><h3>His poem is considered the first kind of what type of protest?</h3><p>nonviolent</p><p>political poem</p><p>nonviolent</p><p>nonviolent</p><p>nonviolent</p><h3>Inspired by Shelley what was the name of Gandhi's doctrine?</h3><p>Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><h3>Gandhi often referenced Shelley's poem in his efforts to do what? </h3><p>free India</p><p>free India</p><p>campaign for a free India</p><p>protest and political action</p><p>during the campaign for a free India</p><h3>What famous author used similarity and likeness of Percy Shelly in his writing?</h3><p>Henry David Thoreau</p><p>Gandhi</p><p>Henry David Thoreau</p><p>Henry David Thoreau</p><p>Gandhi</p><h3>Who wrote the poem The Mark of Anarchy?</h3><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><p>Percy Shelley</p><h3>The Mark of Anarchy was written to protest against what?</h3><p>unjust forms of authority</p><p>Peterloo massacre</p><p>unjust forms of authority</p><p>the unjust forms of authority</p><p>Peterloo massacre</p><h3>What was the principle shown in The Mark of Anarchy?</h3><p>principle of nonviolent protest</p><p>nonviolent protest</p><p>nonviolent protest</p><p>nonviolent protest</p><p>nonviolent protest</p><h3>What was Ghandi's work called?</h3><p>doctrine of Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><p>Satyagraha</p><h3>Which famous Indian practiced civil disobedience?</h3><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi</p><h2>It has been argued that the term &quot;civil disobedience&quot; has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased.

The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau’s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, “Resign.” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is “the voice of the people,” as it is often called, shouldn’t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is “liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.” Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?</h2><h3>What author argues pitching the conscience versus the collective?</h3><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau's</p><h3>What was Thoreau's punishment for not paying his taxes?</h3><p>imprisonment</p><p>imprisonment</p><p>imprisonment</p><p>imprisonment</p><p>imprisonment</p><h3>Thoreau argues that usually majority rules but their views collectively are sometimes?</h3><p>not necessarily right</p><p>not necessarily right</p><p>the will of elite politicians</p><p>the will of elite politicians</p><p>not necessarily right</p><h3>What did Thoreau ask a public figure the taxman to do?</h3><p>Resign</p><p>refusal to pay</p><p>Resign</p><p>Resign</p><p>Resign</p><h3>Thoreau mentions what type of person could corrupt a government system?</h3><p>elite politicians</p><p>elite politicians</p><p>individuals</p><p>elite politicians</p><p>individuals</p><h3>Who is the final judge of right and wrong?</h3><p>The individual</p><p>individuals</p><p>The individual</p><p>The individual</p><p>individual</p><h3>Who is to blame for acting unjustly?</h3><p>individuals</p><p>individuals</p><p>an individual</p><p>individuals</p><p>individuals</p><h3>Who was famous for disobedience against a tax collector?</h3><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau</p><p>Thoreau</p><h3>What advise did Thoreau give the tax collector when unable to perform his duty?</h3><p>Resign</p><p>Resign</p><p>Resign</p><p>Resign</p><p>Resign</p><h3>What did Thoreau claim about the majority?</h3><p>not necessarily right</p><p>may be powerful but it is not necessarily right</p><p>The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right</p><p>The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right</p><p>may be powerful but it is not necessarily right</p><h2>Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects &quot;a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken&quot;.

But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication &quot;A Primer for Prospective Jurors&quot; notes, &quot;Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.&quot; By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.

It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest.

Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesn't have to be political, i.e. &quot;cultural revolution&quot;, it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric). Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience. It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government. Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing &quot;peaceable revolution.&quot; Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, and others have identified the right espoused in The Declaration of Independence to &quot;alter or abolish&quot; an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience. </h2><h3>What is it called when there is an active attempt to overthrow a government or belief system?</h3><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><h3>What group of people performed revolutionary civil disobedience toward the Austrian government?</h3><p>Hungarians</p><p>Hungarians</p><p>the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák</p><p>Hungarians</p><p>Hungarians</p><h3>The Hungarians performed this civil disobedience under the direction of what person?</h3><p>Ferenc Deák</p><p>Ferenc Deák</p><p>Ferenc Deák</p><p>Ferenc Deák</p><p>Ferenc Deák</p><h3>Revolutionary civil disobedience towards culture is highlighted by example of who? </h3><p>Gandhi's</p><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi's</p><h3>What other topics can Civil disobedience pertain to?</h3><p>cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs</p><p>revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc</p><p>cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs</p><p>peaceable revolution</p><h3>What is a simple form of civil disobedience?</h3><p>disobedience of laws</p><p>Non-revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Non-revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Non-revolutionary</p><p>cultural revolution</p><h3>Why would a person chose civil disobedience against specific laws?</h3><p>judged &quot;wrong&quot; by an individual conscience</p><p>they are judged &quot;wrong&quot; by an individual conscience</p><p>they are judged &quot;wrong&quot; by an individual conscience</p><p>to cause their repeal</p><p>they are judged &quot;wrong&quot; by an individual conscience</p><h3>What is the goal of individual civil disobedience?</h3><p>render certain laws ineffective</p><p>to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue</p><p>render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal</p><p>t to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue</p><p>to render certain laws ineffective,</p><h3>What type of civil disobedience is larger scale?</h3><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Revolutionary civil disobedience</p><p>Revolutionary</p><p>Revolutionary</p><h3>What famous Indian's actions were considered civil disobedience?</h3><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi's</p><p>Gandhi's</p><p>Gandhi</p><p>Gandhi's</p><h2>The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire[citation needed].

This is a form of jail solidarity.[page needed] There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.</h2><h3>When did the earliest examples of civil disobedience as a whole occur?</h3><p>during the Roman Empire</p><p>Roman Empire</p><p>during the Roman Empire</p><p>the Roman Empire</p><p>during the Roman Empire</p><h3>What did the Jewish people do so pagan items wouldn't be in the temple of Jerusalem?</h3><p>gathered in the streets</p><p>gathered in the streets</p><p>gathered in the streets</p><p>gathered in the streets</p><p>gathered in the streets</p><h3>Since Thoreau was not a well known writer what happened when he was arrested?</h3><p>was not covered in any newspapers</p><p>was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened.</p><p>his arrest was not covered in any newspapers</p><p>his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened</p><p>his arrest was not covered in any newspapers</p><h3>What position did the tax collector that arrested Thoreau get?</h3><p>rose to higher political office</p><p>higher political office</p><p>higher political office</p><p>rose to higher political office</p><p>higher political office</p><h3>When was Thoreau's essay published?</h3><p>after the end of the Mexican War</p><p>end of the Mexican War</p><p>after the end of the Mexican War.</p><p>after the end of the Mexican War</p><p>after the end of the Mexican War</p><h3>When is the oldest recorded incident of civil disobedience?</h3><p>during the Roman Empire</p><p>during the Roman Empire</p><p>during the Roman Empire</p><p>during the Roman Empire</p><p>during the Roman Empire</p><h3>What was the goal of this Roman disobedience?</h3><p>prevent the installation of pagan images</p><p>prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem</p><p>prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem</p><p>to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem</p><p>prevent the installation of pagan images</p><h3>What is a recent civil disobedience done in a group form?</h3><p>refuse to sign bail</p><p>collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met</p><p>some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met</p><p>jail solidarity</p><h3>What is the civil disobedience called where people refuse to be released?</h3><p>jail solidarity</p><p>solitary civil disobedience</p><p>jail solidarity</p><p>jail solidarity</p><p>jail solidarity</p><h3>How long did it take for Thoreau's disobedience to be known?</h3><p>until after the end of the Mexican War</p><p>months</p><p>months after it happened</p><p>Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War</p><p>after the end of the Mexican War</p><h2>Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Bedau writes, &quot;There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.&quot; Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna, a 180-foot (55 m)-tall, 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days, successfully preventing it from being cut down.</h2><h3>Civil disobedients have chosen many different kinds of what type of behaviors?</h3><p>illegal</p><p>illegal acts</p><p>illegal acts</p><p>illegal acts</p><p>illegal acts</p><h3>Bedau notes that illegal protests towards public policy may serve as what purpose?</h3><p>propaganda</p><p>propaganda</p><p>propaganda</p><p>propaganda</p><p>just a harassment</p><h3>What group of civil disobedients brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the government?</h3><p>Voice in the Wilderness</p><p>Voice in the Wilderness</p><p>Voice in the Wilderness</p><p>Voice in the Wilderness</p><p>Voice in the Wilderness</p><h3>How long did Julia Butterfly Hill live in a tree?</h3><p>738 days</p><p>738 days</p><p>738 days</p><p>738 days</p><p>738 days</p><h3>What was the outcome of living in the California Redwood tree?</h3><p>successfully preventing it from being cut down</p><p>successfully preventing it from being cut down</p><p>successfully preventing it from being cut down</p><p>successfully preventing it from being cut down</p><p>preventing it from being cut down</p><h3>What type of actions are taken sometimes in civil disobedience?</h3><p>illegal acts</p><p>symbolic illegal protests</p><p>symbolic illegal protests</p><p>a variety of different illegal acts</p><p>illegal</p><h3>What is an example of illegal disobedience?</h3><p>trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation</p><p>symbolic illegal protests</p><p>trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation</p><p>the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries</p><p>trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation</p><h3>Such protests are usually considered to be what type?</h3><p>entirely symbolic</p><p>symbolic illegal protests</p><p>harassment</p><p>symbolic</p><p>inane</p><h3>What type of goals are usually done skirting the law?</h3><p>social goal</p><p>social goal</p><p>protests toward public policy</p><p>propaganda</p><p>social</p><h3>Who lived in a tree to prevent it from being cut down as a form of civil disobedience?</h3><p>Julia Butterfly Hill</p><p>Julia Butterfly Hill</p><p>Julia Butterfly Hill</p><p>Julia Butterfly Hill</p><p>Julia Butterfly Hill</p><h2>In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech.

Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies.

For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, &quot;My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.&quot;</h2><h3>What type of government investigations apply to civil disobedience?</h3><p>criminal investigations</p><p>grant a consent search</p><p>grant a consent search</p><p>criminal investigations</p><p>Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations</p><p>criminal</p><h3>What is a way you can show police officers civil disobedience ?</h3><p>not to grant a consent search</p><p>not to talk to police officers</p><p>not to talk to police officers</p><p>not to talk</p><p>resist responding to investigators' questions</p><p>grant a consent search</p><h3>What should be avoided when talking to authorities?</h3><p>suspect's talking to criminal investigators</p><p>responding to investigators' questions</p><p>responding to investigators' questions</p><p>grant a consent search of his property,</p><p>talking to criminal investigators</p><p>responding to investigators' questions</p><h3>What reasons cause failure of the disobedience with authorities?</h3><p>lack of understanding of the legal ramifications,</p><p>a suspect's talking to criminal investigators</p><p>lack of understanding</p><p>lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.</p><h3>Why do some people purposely resist officers of the law?</h3><p>use the arrest as an opportunity</p><p>civil disobedience</p><p>civil disobedience</p><p>civil disobedience</p><p>civil disobedience</p><p>to make an impression</p><h2>Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law. Other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still don't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government, or don't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted. And still other civil disobedients, being anarchists, don't believe in the legitimacy of any government, and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others.</h2><h3>What do some civil disobedient people feel the need to acknowledge.</h3><p>accept punishment</p><p>accept punishment</p><p>punishment</p><p>punishment</p><p>punishment</p><h3>Why is the need for acceptance of punishment needed?</h3><p>validity of the social contract</p><p>their belief in the validity of the social contract</p><p>because of their belief in the validity of the social contract</p><p>belief in the validity of the social contract</p><p>their belief in the validity of the social contract</p><h3>What do some people protest against?</h3><p>legitimacy of a particular law</p><p>law</p><p>laws</p><p>the legitimacy of any government</p><h3>What is the group called that does not agree with government at all?</h3><p>anarchists</p><p>anarchists</p><p>anarchists</p><p>anarchists</p><p>anarchists</p><h3>Anarchists do not want to accept punishment for what reason?</h3><p>does not infringe the rights of others</p><p>don't believe in the legitimacy of any government</p><p>a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others</p><p>see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others</p><p>a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others.</p><h2>An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, &quot;Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,&quot; but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, &quot;Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.&quot; A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, &quot;I plead for the beauty that surrounds us&quot;; this is known as a &quot;creative plea,&quot; and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.</h2><h3>What is an important personal decision for civil disobedients?</h3><p>whether or not to plead guilty</p><p>whether or not to plead guilty</p><p>whether or not to plead guilty</p><p>whether or not to plead guilty</p><p>whether or not to plead guilty.</p><p>whether or not to plead guilty.</p><h3>Which duty do some people believe civil disobedients have?</h3><p>submit to the punishment prescribed by law</p><p>to submit to the punishment prescribed by law</p><p>submit to the punishment</p><p>to submit to the punishment prescribed by law</p><p>to submit to the punishment prescribed by law</p><p>to submit to the punishment prescribed by law</p><h3>Why would one plead guilty to a crime involving civil disobedience?</h3><p>I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law</p><p>I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law</p><p>proud of it</p><p>proud of it</p><p>have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no w</p><p>have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no w</p><h3>Which reason is given sometimes to plead not guilty involving these matters?</h3><p>Guilt implies wrong-doing</p><p>Guilt implies wrong-doing</p><p>guilty of doing no wrong</p><p>Guilt implies wrong-doing</p><p>I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong</p><p>I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong</p><h3>What third type of plea uses creative words?</h3><p>creative plea</p><p>no contest</p><p>creative plea</p><p>creative plea</p><p>creative plea</p><p>creative plea</p><h2>When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest.

They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A well known civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead &quot;nolo contendere&quot;, as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty. The arrested persons were found &quot;guilty,&quot; nevertheless, and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.[citation needed]</h2><h3>Where in Las Vegas did a famous protest take place?</h3><p>Camp Mercury nuclear test site</p><p>Camp Mercury nuclear test site</p><p>Camp Mercury nuclear test site</p><p>Camp Mercury nuclear test site</p><p>Camp Mercury nuclear test site</p><h3>What was the civil disobedience performed at the test site?</h3><p>tempted to enter the test site</p><p>protesters attempted to enter the test site</p><p>attempted to enter the test site</p><p>13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site</p><p>protest</p><h3>What was the result of the disobedience protesting the nuclear site?</h3><p>arrested</p><p>arrest</p><p>were immediately arrested</p><p>one at a time they stepped across the &quot;line&quot; and were immediately arrested</p><p>put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace</p><h3>How did their lawyer suggest they would plea?</h3><p>nolo contendere</p><p>nolo contendere</p><p>nolo contendere</p><p>nolo contendere</p><p>nolo contendere</p><h3>What type of sentences were the protesters given?</h3><p>suspended sentences</p><p>suspended sentences</p><p>suspended</p><p>suspended</p><p>suspended</p><h2>Howard Zinn writes, &quot;There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.&quot;</h2><h3>Why do some people chose to go to jail for their disobedience?</h3><p>a way of continuing their protest</p><p>continuing their protest</p><p>a way of continuing their protest</p><p>a way of continuing their protest</p><p>a way of continuing their protest</p><h3>Going to jail accomplished what goal of civil disobedience?</h3><p>reminding their countrymen of injustice</p><p>reminding their countrymen of injustice</p><p>reminding their countrymen of injustice</p><p>reminding their countrymen of injustice</p><p>reminding their countrymen of injustice</p><h3>What is the most important item for civil disobedience to follow through?</h3><p>protest should be maintained all the way</p><p>spirit of protest</p><p>the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way</p><p>the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way</p><p>spirit of protest</p><h3>Why should one not go to jail?</h3><p>accept jail penitently</p><p>is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience</p><p>To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience</p><p>To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience</p><h2>Sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients, as in the case of the Camden 28, in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time. In some mass arrest situations, the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone. But some activists have opted to enter a blind plea, pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place.

As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.

During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense. In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and United States v. Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.</h2><h3>What is the primary goal of pleading not guilty when arrested for Civil Disobedience?</h3><p>acquittal and avoid imprisonment</p><p>win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine</p><p>to use the proceedings as a forum</p><p>win an acquittal</p><p>to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine</p><h3>What is a secondary goal of pleading not guilty?</h3><p>use the proceedings as a forum</p><p>use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances</p><p>win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment</p><p>use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances</p><p>use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case</p><h3>What would someone who is civilly disobedient do in court?</h3><p>inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances</p><p>plead not guilty</p><p>plead not guilty</p><p>inform the jury and the public</p><p>plead not guilty</p><h3>What US war has a large amount of Civil Disobedients?</h3><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam War</p><h3>What can sympathetic Jurors in cases with civil disobedients?</h3><p>jury nullification</p><p>jury nullification</p><p>jury nullification</p><p>nullification</p><p>nullification</p><h2>One theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience. Likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.</h2><h3>What needs to be avoided with civil disobedience?</h3><p>general disobedience</p><p>undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit</p><p>great amount of it</p><p>general disobedience</p><p>conscientious lawbreakers</p><h3>Why should disobedience by the general public be avoided?</h3><p>neither conscientious nor of social benefit</p><p>neither conscientious nor of social benefit</p><p>any great amount of it would undermine the law</p><p>conscientious lawbreakers</p><h3>What is one main reason that civil disobedience is not recognized?</h3><p>breaking the law for self-gratification</p><p>breaking the law for self-gratification</p><p>it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience</p><p>breaking the law for self-gratification</p><h3>Why should someone not commit a crime when they are protesting?</h3><p>not being a civil disobedient</p><p>viewed as not being a civil disobedient</p><p>conscientious lawbreakers must be punished</p><p>it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience</p><p>constitute civil disobedience</p><h3>For what reason would someone avoid crimes while protesting?</h3><p>avoiding attribution</p><p>viewed as not being a civil disobedient</p><p>it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience</p><p>constitute civil disobedience</p><h2>Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: &quot;Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.&quot; During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to FIJA, many of them have escaped prosecution because &quot;prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.&quot;</h2><h3>What is violating a law which is not the goal of the protest called?</h3><p>Indirect civil disobedience</p><p>Indirect civil disobedience</p><p>Indirect civil disobedience</p><p>Indirect civil disobedience</p><p>Indirect civil disobedience</p><h3>When the law is a direct target of the protest, what is this called?</h3><p>direct civil disobedience</p><p>direct civil disobedience</p><p>direct civil disobedience</p><p>direct civil disobedience</p><p>direct civil disobedience</p><h3>What US war caused a high amount of civil disobedience?</h3><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam War</p><p>Vietnam</p><h3>What type of defense is sometimes used in court by protestors?</h3><p>competing harms defense</p><p>necessity defense</p><p>necessity defense</p><p>necessity</p><h3>Why are people who distribute leaflets inside courthouses not been arrested?</h3><p>the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence</p><p>if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence</p><p>the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence</p><p>the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence</p><p>the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence</p><h2>Along with giving the offender his &quot;just deserts&quot;, achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment. Brownlee argues, &quot;Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law’s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law.&quot; Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes, &quot;In deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good. This means that the objector has no right not to be punished. It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not.&quot;</h2><h3>What is the main goal of criminal punishment of civil disobedients?</h3><p>incapacitation</p><p>achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence</p><p>achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence</p><p>achieving crime control</p><p>achieving crime control</p><h3>What should be the main goal of not using punishment in a just system?</h3><p>would do more harm than good</p><p>whether it would do more harm than good</p><p>it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law</p><p>whether it would do more harm than good</p><p>whether it would do more harm than good.</p><h3>Who decides the fate of protesters most of the time?</h3><p>the state</p><p>judges</p><p>the state (including the judges)</p><p>the judges</p><p>judges</p><h3>What should the punishment rely on instead in a just society?</h3><p>moral reasons to follow this law</p><p>whether it would do more harm than good</p><p>whether it would do more harm than good</p><p>whether it would do more harm than good</p><p>whether it would do more harm than good</p></div></body></html>
