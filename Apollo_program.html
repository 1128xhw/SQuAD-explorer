<html><body><div><h1>Apollo_program</h1><h2>The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of &quot;landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth&quot; by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in a May 25, 1961, address to Congress. Project Mercury was followed by the two-man Project Gemini (1962–66). The first manned flight of Apollo was in 1968.</h2><h3>What project put the first Americans into space?</h3><p>Project Mercury</p><p>spacecraft</p><p>Project Mercury</p><p>Apollo</p><p>Project Apollo</p><h3>What program was created to carry out these projects and missions?</h3><p>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</p><p>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA</p><p>Apollo</p><p>Project Mercury</p><p>Apollo program</p><h3>What year did the first manned Apollo flight occur?</h3><p>1968</p><p>1969</p><p>1962</p><p>1968</p><p>1969</p><h3>What President is credited with the original notion of putting Americans in space?</h3><p>Dwight D.

Gemini missions developed some of the space travel techniques that were necessary for the success of the Apollo missions. Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles. Apollo/Saturn vehicles were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973–74, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975.</h2><h3>How long did Project Apollo run?</h3><p>1961 to 1972</p><p>1961 to 1972</p><p>1961 to 1972</p><p>1961 to 1972</p><p>Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972</p><h3>What program helped develop space travel techniques that Project Apollo used?</h3><p>Gemini program</p><p>Gemini</p><p>Gemini</p><p>Gemini</p><p>Gemini program</p><h3>Who did the U.S. collaborate with on an Earth orbit mission in 1975?</h3><p>Soviet Union</p><p>Apollo Applications Program</p><p>Soviet Union</p><p>Soviet Union</p><p>Soviet Union</p><h3>What space station supported three manned missions in 1973-1974?</h3><p>Skylab</p><p>Skylab</p><p>Skylab</p><p>Skylab</p><p>Skylab</p><h2>The Apollo program succeeded in achieving its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 Apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which disabled the command spacecraft's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a &quot;lifeboat&quot; for these functions.</h2><h3>In what year did the Apollo 1 cabin fire occur?</h3><p>1967</p><p>1967</p><p>1967</p><p>1967</p><p>1967</p><h3>What type of launch was happening during the Apollo 1 incident?</h3><p>prelaunch test</p><p>prelaunch</p><p>prelaunch test</p><p>prelaunch test</p><h3>What forced the cancellations of three future landings?</h3><p>Budget cuts</p><p>oxygen tank explosion</p><p>Budget cuts</p><p>Budget cuts</p><p>Budget cuts</p><h3>How many of the remaining launches were successful?</h3><p>Five</p><p>six</p><p>Five</p><p>Five</p><p>Five of the remaining six missions</p><h3>What happened to Apollo 13?</h3><p>oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon</p><p>disabled the command spacecraft's propulsion and life support</p><p>oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon</p><p>oxygen tank explosion</p><p>oxygen tank explosion in transit</p><h2>Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's current human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.</h2><h3>What was the first spacecraft to orbit another celestial body?</h3><p>Apollo 8</p><p>Apollo 8</p><p>Apollo 8</p><p>Apollo 8</p><p>Apollo 8</p><h3>What Apollo mission was the sixth moon landing?</h3><p>Apollo 17</p><p>Apollo 17</p><p>Apollo 17</p><p>Apollo 17</p><p>Apollo 17</p><h3>How many kgs of moon rocks did the program bring back?</h3><p>382 kg</p><p>382</p><p>382</p><p>382</p><p>382 kg</p><h3>What other areas did the Apollo missions help spur advancements in?</h3><p>avionics, telecommunications, and computers</p><p>NASA's current human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center</p><p>avionics, telecommunications, and computers</p><p>avionics, telecommunications, and computers.</p><p>rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers</p><h2>The Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to Project Mercury. While the Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three astronauts. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station, circumlunar flights, and eventual manned lunar landings. The program was named after the Greek god of light, music, and the sun by NASA manager Abe Silverstein, who later said that &quot;I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.&quot; Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt &quot;Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.&quot;</h2><h3>How many people could the Mercury capsule hold?</h3><p>one</p><p>three</p><p>one</p><p>one</p><p>one astronaut</p><h3>How many people could Apollo be projected to hold?</h3><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three astronauts</p><h3>Who named the Apollo missions?</h3><p>Abe Silverstein</p><p>Abe Silverstein</p><p>Abe Silverstein</p><p>Abe Silverstein</p><p>NASA manager Abe Silverstein</p><h3>What was the eventual final goal of the Apollo projects?</h3><p>manned lunar landings</p><p>manned lunar landings</p><p>lunar landings</p><p>ferrying crews to a space station, circumlunar flights, and eventual manned lunar landings</p><h3>When was the Apollo project conceived? </h3><p>early 1960</p><p>1960</p><p>1960</p><p>1960</p><p>early 1960</p><h2>In July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of Space Task Group conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module (piloting and re-entry cabin), and a propulsion and equipment module. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to General Dynamics/Convair, General Electric, and the Glenn L. Martin Company. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by Maxime Faget, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.</h2><h3>In what year was the Apollo program announced?</h3><p>1960</p><p>1960</p><p>1960</p><p>1960</p><p>July 1960</p><h3>Who led the in house design studies for NASA?</h3><p>Maxime Faget</p><p>Hugh L.

Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the &quot;missile gap&quot; that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not &quot;first but, first and, first if, but first period.&quot; Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing. When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.</h2><h3>Who was elected President in November 1960?</h3><p>John F.

At a meeting of the US House Committee on Science and Astronautics one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up. Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.</h2><h3>Who was the first person in space?</h3><p>Yuri Gagarin</p><p>Yuri Gagarin</p><p>Yuri Gagarin</p><p>Yuri Gagarin</p><p>Yuri Gagarin</p><h3>From what country did the first person in space come from?</h3><p>Soviet Union</p><p>Soviet</p><p>Soviet Union</p><p>Soviet Union</p><p>Soviet Union</p><h3>How many days after Gagarin's flight did the US House Committee on Science and Astronautics meet?</h3><p>one day</p><p>one</p><p>one</p><p>one</p><p>one day</p><h3>What did President Kennedy do in response to the Soviet flight in regards of America's program?</h3><p>refusing to make a commitment</p><p>refusing to make a commitment</p><p>refusing to make a commitment</p><p>refusing to make a commitment on America's response</p><h2>On April 20, Kennedy sent a memo to Vice President Lyndon B.

Gilruth's Space Task Group, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's Langley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC). A site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961. It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control Center would be included in the MSC.</h2><h3>Who originally led the Space Task Group?</h3><p>Robert R.

The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end: LC-34 and LC-37. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island. The design, development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus, a member of Dr. Wernher von Braun's original V-2 rocket engineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director. Construction began in November 1962. Upon Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy.</h2><h3>Where would the Launch Operations Center be located, as more land was needed for a bigger rocket?</h3><p>Merritt Island</p><p>Florida</p><p>Merritt Island</p><p>Merritt Island</p><p>Merritt Island</p><h3>Who conducted the construction of the new center?</h3><p>Kurt H.

Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated A and B, were completed in October 1965. The LOC also included an Operations and Checkout Building (OCB) to which Gemini and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles. The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250,000 feet (76 km), which is nearly a vacuum.</h2><h3>How many launch pads were originally planned?</h3><p>three</p><p>several</p><p>three</p><p>three pads</p><p>three</p><h3>What spacecraft was tested in two vacuum chambers to simulate atmospheric pressure?</h3><p>Apollo spacecraft</p><p>Apollo</p><p>Apollo</p><p>Apollo</p><h3>How high in altitude in feet could the vacuum chambers simulate?</h3><p>250,000 feet</p><p>250,000 feet</p><p>250,000</p><p>250,000 feet</p><p>250,000 feet (</p><h3>How big was the Vertical Assembly Building?</h3><p>130 million cubic foot</p><p>130 million cubic foot</p><p>3.7 million cubic meter</p><p>3.7 million cubic meter</p><p>130 million cubic foot</p><h2>Administrator Webb realized that in order to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Robert Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.</h2><h3>Who did Webb recruit for better project management?</h3><p>Dr. George E.

Schriever agreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along with a staff of officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director.

Many engineers feared that a rendezvous —let alone a docking— neither of which had been attempted even in Earth orbit, would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit. Dissenters including John Houbolt at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke &quot;somewhat as a voice in the wilderness,&quot; Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.</h2><h3>What did the engineers fear would be difficult in space due to it never being attempted in Earth orbit?</h3><p>a rendezvous —let alone a docking</p><p>rendezvous</p><p>rendezvous</p><p>rendezvous</p><p>docking</p><h3>In what year was direct ascent the primary mission focus at NASA?</h3><p>1961</p><p>1960</p><p>1961</p><p>1961</p><p>1961</p><h3>Who was the Associate Administrator that Houbolt spoke with?</h3><p>Robert Seamans</p><p>Robert Seamans</p><p>Robert Seamans</p><p>Robert Seamans</p><p>Robert Seamans;</p><h2> Seamans' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E.

This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR —as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work— played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing in June 1962.</h2><h3>Who led the committee established by Seaman?</h3><p>Nicholas E.

Webb held firm, and issued a request for proposal to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October Cuban missile crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.</h2><h3>What was the shape that Faget designed for the Apollo command module?</h3><p>cone-shaped</p><p>cone</p><p>cone</p><p>cone-shaped</p><p>cone</p><h3>What does the acronym CSM stand for?</h3><p>Command/Service Module</p><p>Command/Service Module (</p><p>Command/Service Module</p><p>Command/Service Module</p><p>Command/Service Module</p><h3>How many men would the LM take to the lunar surface and return to the CSM?</h3><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two men</p><p>two</p><h2>The Command Module (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing. It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs. Its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield, and had its own reaction control system (RCS) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path. Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown.

Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.</h2><h3>Who was rewarded with building the CSM?</h3><p>North American Aviation</p><p>North American Aviation</p><p>North American Aviation</p><p>North American Aviation</p><p>North American Aviation</p><h3>How much thrust was estimated for the translunar flight?</h3><p>twice the thrust</p><p>twice the thrust required</p><p>twice the thrust</p><p>twice the thrust</p><h3>In what year was a program study done on the modules labeled as Block I and Block II?</h3><p>1964</p><p>1964</p><p>1964</p><p>1964</p><p>1964</p><h3>What was the name of the launch vehicle for NASA, which North American Aviation designed the second stage of?</h3><p>Saturn V</p><p>Saturn V</p><p>Saturn V</p><p>Saturn V</p><h2>The Lunar Module (LM) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, each with its own engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds (15,100 kg), and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours.

In the midst of these plans, von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA, and made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. The initial direct ascent plan to send the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module directly to the lunar surface, on top of a large descent rocket stage, would require a Nova-class launcher, with a lunar payload capability of over 180,000 pounds (82,000 kg). The June 11, 1962, decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova, and the MSFC proceeded to develop the Saturn rocket family for Apollo.</h2><h3>Who had worked on the Saturn series even before the Apollo program began officially?</h3><p>Wernher von Braun</p><p>Wernher von Braun</p><p>Wernher von Braun</p><p>Wernher von Braun</p><p>Wernher von Braun</p><h3>From where was von Braun transferred to go to NASA?</h3><p>Army</p><p>Army</p><p>Army</p><p>Army</p><p>Army</p><h3>When was the decision made to replace the Nova rockets with the Saturn V?</h3><p>June 11, 1962</p><p>1962</p><p>June 11, 1962</p><p>June 11, 1962</p><p>June 11, 1962</p><h2>The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water.

Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.</h2><h3>What was the technical name of the first unmanned Saturn V flight, Apollo 4?</h3><p>AS-501</p><p>AS-501</p><p>AS-501</p><p>AS-501</p><p>AS-501</p><h3>What was one thing that was specifically tested on the Apollo 4 test launch regarding the CM?</h3><p>heat shield</p><p>Service Module engine</p><p>heat shield</p><p>capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry</p><p>capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry</p><h3>When was Apollo 6, or AS-502, tested?</h3><p>April 4, 1968</p><p>1968</p><p>April 4, 1968</p><p>April 4, 1968</p><p>April 4, 1968</p><h3>What was cancelled by NASA after the Apollo 6 testing, after deeming the Saturn V ready to hold men?</h3><p>third unmanned test</p><p>Apollo 6</p><p>third unmanned test</p><p>cancelling a third unmanned test</p><p>third unmanned test.</p><h2>Apollo 5 (AS-204) was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a &quot;fire-in-the-hole&quot; test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage.

In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth.</h2><h3>What type of Saturn was originally going to be used for Apollo 8?</h3><p>two Saturn IBs</p><p>V</p><p>two Saturn IBs</p><p>Saturn V</p><p>two Saturn IBs</p><h3>What spacecraft did the Soviets use to send animals to space and around the moon's orbit?</h3><p>Zond 5</p><p>Zond 5</p><p>Zond 5</p><p>Zond 5</p><p>Zond 5</p><h3>On what day were images of the moon's surface transmitted to Earth via television images?</h3><p>Christmas Eve</p><p>Christmas Eve</p><p>Christmas Eve</p><p>Christmas Eve</p><h3>What did Low suggest using Apollo 8 for instead of simply orbiting the Earth's surface?</h3><p>orbit the Moon</p><p>orbit the Moon</p><p>to orbit the Moon</p><p>orbit the Moon</p><p>orbit the Moon</p><h3>What did the Soviets intend to use in spacecraft after the success of Zond 5?</h3><p>human cosmonauts</p><p>human cosmonauts</p><p>human cosmonauts</p><p>human cosmonauts</p><h2>The G mission was achieved on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.

These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM.

Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.

During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.</h2><h3>What type of camera was used to record the Moon landing?</h3><p>special Apollo TV camera</p><p>Apollo TV camera</p><p>Apollo TV</p><p>Apollo TV camera</p><p>Apollo TV camera</p><h3>Was this footage compatible or incompatible with live broadcast TV formats?</h3><p>incompatible</p><p>had to be converted</p><p>incompatible</p><p>format incompatible with broadcast TV</p><p>incompatible</p><h3>What happened to prompt NASA to record over archived magnetic tapes?</h3><p>magnetic tape shortage</p><p>remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over</p><p>magnetic tape shortage</p><p>magnetic tape shortage</p><p>magnetic tape shortage</p><h3>What did NASA record over the older archived tapes?</h3><p>newer satellite data</p><p>the National Archives and Records Administration</p><p>newer satellite data</p><p>satellite data</p><p>satellite data</p><h3>Who worked later on to find these missing magnetic tapes that had data stored on them?</h3><p>Stan Lebar</p><p>Nafzger</p><p>Stan Lebar</p><p>Stan Lebar</p><p>Stan Lebar</p><h2>With a budget of $230,000, the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration. The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy. The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.</h2><h3>Who compiled the original surviving Apollo 11 landing data?</h3><p>Nafzger</p><p>Nafzger</p><p>Nafzger</p><p>Nafzger</p><p>Nafzger</p><h3>Were the tapes able to be restored and processed without destroying historical legitimacy or did some aspects of the tapes lose legitimacy?</h3><p>without destroying historical legitimacy</p><p>Lowry Digital f</p><p>without destroying historical legitimacy</p><p>processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy</p><p>without destroying historical legitimacy</p><h3>What types of recordings at Johnson Space Center were used to help restore the original tapes?</h3><p>kinescope recordings</p><p>kinescope</p><p>kinescope recordings</p><p>kinescope</p><h3>Which company was tasked with trying to restore the original tapes?</h3><p>Lowry Digital</p><p>CBS</p><p>Lowry Digital</p><p>Lowry Digital</p><p>Lowry Digital</p><h3>Were the restored tapes able to have color added to them to enhance the picture or did they remain black and white?</h3><p>black and white</p><p>black and white,</p><p>black and white</p><p>remaining in black and white</p><p>remaining in black and white,</p></div></body></html>
