<html><body><div><h1>1973_oil_crisis</h1><h2>The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) proclaimed an oil embargo. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or &quot;shock&quot;, with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy. It was later called the &quot;first oil shock&quot;, followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the &quot;second oil shock.&quot;</h2><h3>When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?</h3><p>October 1973</p><p>October 1973</p><p>October 1973</p><p>October</p><p>1973</p><h3>What was the price of oil in March of 1974?</h3><p>nearly $12</p><p>$12</p><p>$12</p><p>$12</p><p>$12</p><h3>When was the second oil crisis?</h3><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><h3>What was another term used for the oil crisis?</h3><p>first oil shock</p><p>shock</p><p>shock</p><p>first oil shock</p><p>shock</p><h3>Who proclaimed the oil embargo?</h3><p>members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries</p><p>members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries</p><p>Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries</p><p>members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries</p><p>OAPEC</p><h2>The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.</h2><h3>Why did the European nations and Japan separated themselves from United States during the crisis?</h3><p>to avoid being targeted by the boycott</p><p>to avoid being targeted by the boycott</p><p>to avoid being targeted by the boycott</p><p>to avoid being targeted by the boycott</p><p>to avoid being targeted by the boycott</p><h3>How did the Nixon administration negotiate with the uncooperative countries?</h3><p>They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights.</p><p>multilateral</p><p>They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights</p><p>multilateral negotiations</p><p>multilateral</p><h3>On what date did Henry Kissinger negotiate an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula?</h3><p>January 18, 1974,</p><p>January 18, 1974</p><p>January 18, 1974</p><p>January 18, 1974</p><p>January 18, 1974</p><h3>When did the Arab oil producers lift the embargo?</h3><p>March 1974</p><p>March 1974</p><p>March 1974</p><p>March 1974.</p><p>March 1974</p><h2>On August 15, 1971, the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord. The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, whose value was left to &quot;float&quot; (rise and fall according to market demand). Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before. The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.</h2><h3>When did the United States withdraw from the Bretton Woods Accord?</h3><p>On August 15, 1971</p><p>August 15, 1971</p><p>August 15, 1971</p><p>August 15, 1971</p><p>August 15, 1971</p><h3>What does it mean when currencies are left to &quot;float?&quot;</h3><p>to &quot;float&quot; (rise and fall according to market demand)</p><p>(rise and fall according to market demand</p><p>rise and fall according to market demand</p><p>rise and fall according to market demand</p><p>rise and fall according to market demand</p><h3>Why was there a depreciation of the industrialized nations dollars?</h3><p>industrialized nations increased their reserves</p><p>industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before</p><p>industrialized nations increased their reserves</p><p>industrialized nations increased their reserves</p><p>the industrialized nations increased their reserves</p><h3>When did oil start getting priced in the terms of gold?</h3><p>In September 1971</p><p>September 1971</p><p>September 1971</p><p>September 1971</p><p>September 1971</p><h3>Why did oil start getting priced in terms of gold?</h3><p>oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased</p><p>Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased.</p><p>Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased</p><p>Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased</p><p>Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased</p><h2>This contributed to the &quot;Oil Shock&quot;. After 1971, OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation. From 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year. Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities. OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged. The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.</h2><h3>From 1947 to 1967, how much did the price of oil increase?</h3><p>risen by less than two percent per year</p><p>less than two percent per year</p><p>less than two percent per year</p><p>by less than two percent per year</p><p>less than two percent per year</p><h3>When did OPEC start to readjust oil prices?</h3><p>After 1971</p><p>1973–1974</p><p>1971</p><p>After 1971</p><p>1971</p><h3>When did oil finally returned to its Bretton Woods levels?</h3><p>1973–1974</p><p>1974</p><p>1973–1974</p><p>1973–1974</p><p>1973–1974</p><h3>The price of oil is usually a stable commodity until when?</h3><p>Until the oil shock</p><p>the oil shock</p><p>the oil shock</p><p>Until the oil shock</p><p>the oil shock</p><h2>On October 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt, with support from other Arab nations, launched a surprise attack on Israel, on Yom Kippur. This renewal of hostilities in the Arab–Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices. At the time, Iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally. Weeks later, the Shah of Iran said in an interview: &quot;Of course [the price of oil] is going to rise... Certainly! And how!... You've [Western nations] increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement... You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us, refined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid us... It's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for oil.

The following day, oil ministers agreed to the embargo, a cut in production by five percent from September's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met. On October 19, Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel, including $1.5 billion in outright grants. George Lenczowski notes, &quot;Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon's eagerness to prevent Israel's collapse...This [$2.2 billion] decision triggered a collective OPEC response.&quot; Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on October 20, 1973. At their Kuwait meeting, OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the US as a &quot;principal hostile country&quot;.</h2><h3>Why did OPEC raise the price of oil to $5.11?</h3><p>In response to American aid to Israel</p><p>In response to American aid to Israel</p><p>In response to American aid to Israel</p><p>In response to American aid to Israel</p><p>American aid to Israel</p><h3>When did they raise the price of oil to $5.11?</h3><p>October 16, 1973,</p><p>October 16, 1973</p><p>October 16, 1973</p><p>October 16, 1973</p><p>October 16, 1973</p><h3>Why did the oil ministers agree to a cut in oil production?</h3><p>until their economic and political objectives were met</p><p>In response to American aid to Israel</p><p>OPEC raised the posted price of oil</p><p>until their economic and political objectives were met</p><h3>How much was the emergency aid to Israel?</h3><p>$2.2 billion</p><p>$2.2 billion</p><p>$2.2 billion</p><p>$2.2 billion</p><p>$2.2 billion</p><h3>Why did OPEC block oil deliveries to the United States?</h3><p>American aid to Israel</p><p>Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel</p><p>OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the US as a &quot;principal hostile country</p><p>OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries</p><p>American aid to Israel</p><h2>Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities, amid shrinking Western demand. Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the Middle East.

The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil. Further, interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger's dominance. In the US production, distribution and price disruptions &quot;have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth.&quot;</h2><h3>What is one of the reason that US production has been held responsible for recessions and lower economic growth?</h3><p>distribution and price disruptions</p><p>reduced productivity</p><p>distribution and price disruptions</p><p>distribution and price disruptions</p><h3>US is concerned about confrontation of the Middle East with which other country?</h3><p>USSR</p><p>USSR</p><p>USSR</p><p>USSR</p><p>USSR</p><h3>Scholars stated that there was already an existing settlement between 2 parties prior to which date?</h3><p>1973</p><p>1973</p><p>1973</p><p>1973</p><h3>Interest groups and government agencies that were concerned with energy were no match for who?</h3><p>Kissinger</p><p>Kissinger</p><p>Kissinger</p><p>Kissinger's</p><p>Kissinger</p><h2>The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S. energy security. On an international level, the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries, such as automobiles. Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts. The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic. Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production.</h2><h3>What has a negative influence over the US economy?</h3><p>The embargo</p><p>The embargo</p><p>The embargo</p><p>The embargo</p><p>embargo</p><h3>On an international level, which industry's competitive positions is affected? </h3><p>automobiles</p><p>automobiles</p><p>automobiles</p><p>automobiles</p><p>automobiles</p><h3>Which problem consists of both  inflationary and deflationary impacts?</h3><p>Macroeconomic problems</p><p>Macroeconomic</p><p>Macroeconomic</p><p>Macroeconomic</p><p>Macroeconomic</p><h3>The oil crisis caused oil companies to increase oil supplies in which area?</h3><p>Arctic</p><p>Arctic</p><p>Arctic</p><p>the Arctic</p><p>the Arctic</p><h3>How long does it take for new areas to have significant oil production?</h3><p>five to ten years</p><p>five to ten years</p><p>five to ten years</p><p>five to ten years</p><p>five to ten years</p><h2>The embargo was not uniform across Europe. Of the nine members of the European Economic Community (EEC), the Netherlands faced a complete embargo, the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies (having refused to allow America to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis), while the other six faced partial cutbacks. The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and Harold Wilson's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War. His successor, Ted Heath, reversed this policy in 1970, calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.</h2><h3>Which country faced a complete embargo in the EEC?</h3><p>Netherlands</p><p>Netherlands</p><p>the Netherlands</p><p>the Netherlands</p><h3>The UK and France had non interruptions in their oil supply as they did not allow which country to use their airfield?</h3><p>America</p><p>America</p><p>America</p><p>America</p><h3>Which country is a traditional ally of Israel?</h3><p>UK</p><p>UK</p><p>The UK</p><p>The UK</p><h3>Harold WInston's supported which country's during its six day war?</h3><p>Israel</p><p>Israel</p><p>Israelis</p><p>the Israelis</p><h3>Who wanted Israel to withdraw from its border?</h3><p>Ted Heath</p><p>Ted Heath</p><p>Ted Heath</p><p>Ted Heath</p><h2>Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo, the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own - a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became a major factor in the change of government.

The system limited the price of &quot;old oil&quot; (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity. The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies. The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration. Scarcity was addressed by rationing (as in many countries). Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973.</h2><h3>What made the oil crisis worse in the US?</h3><p>Price controls</p><p>Price controls</p><p>Price controls</p><p>Price controls</p><p>Price controls</p><h3>Why are newly discovered oil sold at a higher price?</h3><p>encourage investment</p><p>to encourage investment</p><p>to encourage investment</p><p>to encourage investment</p><p>The system limited the price of &quot;old oil&quot;</p><h3>Why was old oil withdrawn from the market?</h3><p>Price controls</p><p>Price controls</p><p>promote oil exploration</p><p>discouraged development of alternative energies</p><p>The system limited the price of &quot;old oil&quot;</p><h3>How was scarcity managed in many countries?</h3><p>rationing</p><p>rationing</p><p>rationing</p><p>rationing</p><p>rationing</p><h2>In 1973, Nixon named William E.

In other states, lines at gasoline stations were common.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as &quot;a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.&quot;</h2><h3>Which country's invasion show the insecurity of the Middle East?</h3><p>USSR's invasion</p><p>Afghanistan</p><p>USSR's</p><p>USSR</p><p>Afghanistan</p><h3>Which countries became dependent on US's security assurance to threats?</h3><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran</p><h3>Which country's arms purchase from the US became 5 times more than Israel?</h3><p>Saudi Arabia</p><p>Saudi Arabia</p><p>Saudi Arabia</p><p>Saudi Arabia</p><p>Saudi Arabia</p><h3>When did the Shah kingdom start to collapse?</h3><p>January 1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>January 1979</p><h3>When did the Wahhabi seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca?</h3><p>November 1979</p><p>November 1979</p><p>November 1979</p><p>November 1979</p><p>November 1979</p><h2>The crisis reduced the demand for large cars. Japanese imports, primarily the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun 510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.</h2><h3>Which sized cars were the least demanded cars in the crisis?</h3><p>large cars</p><p>large</p><p>large</p><p>large</p><h3>Which country's cars became more highly sought after as they were more fuel efficient?</h3><p>Japanese imports</p><p>Japan</p><p>Japanese</p><p>Japanese</p><p>Japanese</p><h3>What type of engines does the American car typically have?</h3><p>V8 and six cylinder engines</p><p>V8 and six cylinder</p><p>V8 and six cylinder</p><p>V8 and six cylinder</p><p>V8 and six cylinder</p><h3>Which country's imports became the de facto mass market leaders?</h3><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><p>Japanese</p><p>Japanese</p><p>Japanese</p><h2>Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.</h2><h3>When did Honda, Toyota and Nissan open US assembly plants?</h3><p>A decade after the 1973</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>A decade after the 1973 oil crisis</p><p>1981</p><h3>Name a larger car that Toyota came up with as buyers lamented the small sized compacts?</h3><p>Toyota Corona Mark II</p><p>Corona Mark II</p><p>Toyota Corona Mark II</p><p>Corona Mark II</p><h3>Name an extra that was added to the production of the compacts.</h3><p>power steering</p><p>air conditioning</p><p>air conditioning</p><p>power windows</p><h3>Name a luxury division of Toyota.</h3><p>Lexus</p><p>Lexus</p><p>Lexus</p><p>Acura</p><p>Lexus</p><h2>Compact trucks were introduced, such as the Toyota Hilux and the Datsun Truck, followed by the Mazda Truck (sold as the Ford Courier), and the Isuzu-built Chevrolet LUV. Mitsubishi rebranded its Forte as the Dodge D-50 a few years after the oil crisis. Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively. Later the American makers introduced their domestic replacements (Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota and the Chevrolet S10/GMC S-15), ending their captive import policy.</h2><h3>Name a type of Toyota compact trucks?</h3><p>Toyota Hilux</p><p>Hilux</p><p>Hilux</p><p>Toyota Hilux</p><p>Hilux</p><h3>What did Mitsubishi rename its Forte to?</h3><p>Dodge D-50</p><p>Dodge D-50</p><p>Dodge D-50</p><p>Dodge D-50</p><p>Dodge D-50</p><h3>Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu joined partnership with which American car company?</h3><p>Ford, Chrysler, and GM</p><p>Ford, Chrysler, and GM</p><p>Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively</p><p>Ford</p><p>Ford, Chrysler, and GM</p><h3>When American car companies rolled out with their domestic replacement cars, which policy ended?</h3><p>captive import policy</p><p>captive import</p><p>captive import</p><p>captive import</p><p>captive import</p><h2>An increase in imported cars into North America forced General Motors, Ford and Chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales. The Dodge Omni / Plymouth Horizon from Chrysler, the Ford Fiesta and the Chevrolet Chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s. By 1985, the average American vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon, compared to 13.5 in 1970. The improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $12 from 1974 to 1979. Sales of large sedans for most makes (except Chrysler products) recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis. The Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood, Buick Electra, Oldsmobile 98, Lincoln Continental, Mercury Marquis, and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s. The only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air, and Ford Galaxie 500. Slightly smaller, mid-size models such as the Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Ford Thunderbird and various other models sold well.</h2><h3>Why did GM, Ford and Chrysler introduced fuel-efficient and small cars to the US market?</h3><p>An increase in imported cars</p><p>An increase in imported cars into North America</p><p>An increase in imported cars into North America</p><p>An increase in imported cars</p><p>An increase in imported cars</p><h3>How many passengers can the Ford Fiesta accommodate?</h3><p>at least four passengers</p><p>four</p><p>at least four passengers</p><p>at least four</p><p>four</p><h3>By which year did the American cars mpg start to improve?</h3><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><p>1985</p><h3>Name a luxury model that became popular in the mid-1970s.</h3><p>Lincoln Continental,</p><p>Cadillac DeVille</p><p>Cadillac DeVille</p><p>Cadillac DeVille</p><h3>Which full-sized model cars were not popular?</h3><p>Chevrolet Bel Air</p><p>lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air, and Ford Galaxie 500</p><p>lower price models</p><p>Chevrolet Bel Air, and Ford Galaxie 500</p><p>Chevrolet Bel Air, and Ford Galaxie 500</p><h2>Federal safety standards, such as NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 (pertaining to safety bumpers), and compacts like the 1974 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT &quot;downsize&quot; revision of vehicle categories. By 1977, GM's full-sized cars reflected the crisis. By 1979, virtually all &quot;full-size&quot; American cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions. Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year, moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 (except for the M-body Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue sedans).</h2><h3>By which year did full sized American cars shrink to be smaller?</h3><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><p>1979</p><h3>By which year did Chrysler ended its full sized luxury model?</h3><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><h3>Which car shows the DOT's revision of categories?</h3><p>Mustang I</p><p>the 1974 Mustang I</p><p>Mustang I</p><p>1974 Mustang I</p><p>1974 Mustang I</p><h2>OPEC soon lost its preeminent position, and in 1981, its production was surpassed by that of other countries. Additionally, its own member nations were divided. Saudi Arabia, trying to recover market share, increased production, pushing prices down, shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers. The world price, which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $40 per barrel, decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel. Adjusted for inflation, oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels. This &quot;sale&quot; price was a windfall for oil-importing nations, both developing and developed.</h2><h3>When was OPEC production of oil being surpassed?</h3><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><p>1981</p><h3>Which year did the price of oil drop to $10 per barrel?</h3><p>1980s</p><p>during the 1980s</p><p>1980s</p><p>1980s</p><p>1980s</p><h3>Why did Saudi Arabia try to increase production, and reduce profits for high cost producers?</h3><p>recover market share</p><p>trying to recover market share</p><p>recover market share</p><p>to recover market share</p><p>recover market share</p><h3>In 1979, during the oil crisis, what was the highest price of oil?</h3><p>nearly $40 per barrel</p><p>nearly $40 per barrel</p><p>$40 per barrel</p><p>$40 per barrel</p><p>$40 per barrel</p></div></body></html>
