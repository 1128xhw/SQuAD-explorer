In the 19th century its main predecessor was a leader in Evangelicalism. Founded in 1968 by the union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, the UMC traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley in England as well as the Great Awakening in the United States. As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan. It embraces both liturgical and evangelical elements.</h2><h3>What does UMC stand for?</h3><p>United Methodist Church</p><p>United Methodist Church (UMC)</p><p>United Methodist Church</p><h3>What is the United Methodist Church?</h3><p>mainline Protestant Methodist denomination</p><p>is a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination</p><p>a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination</p><h3>When was the UMC founded?</h3><p>1968</p><p>mainline Protestant Methodist denomination</p><p>1968</p><h3>Who founded the UMC?</h3><p>union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church</p><p>John and Charles Wesley in England</p><p>the union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church</p><h3>What is the church's theological orientation?</h3><p>Wesleyan</p><p>orientation is decidedly Wesleyan</p><p>Wesleyan</p><h2>The United Methodist Church is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world. In the United States, the UMC ranks as the largest mainline Protestant denomination, the largest Protestant church after the Southern Baptist Convention, and the third largest Christian denomination. As of 2014, worldwide membership was about 12 million: 7.2 million in the United States, and 4.4 million in Africa, Asia and Europe. It is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and other religious associations. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 3.6% of the U.S population, or 9 million adult adherents, self-identify with the United Methodist Church revealing a much larger number of adherents than registered membership.</h2><h3>What is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement?</h3><p>United Methodist Church</p><p>The United Methodist Church</p><p>The United Methodist Church</p><h3>Approximately how many adherents does the United Methodist Church have across the world?</h3><p>80 million</p><p>80 million adherents</p><p>80 million</p><h3>In the United States the UMC ranks as the largest what?</h3><p>mainline Protestant denomination</p><p>Protestant denomination</p><p>mainline Protestant denomination</p><h3>What percentage of the U.S. population self-identify with UMC?</h3><p>3.6%</p><p>3.6% of the U.S population, or</p><p>3.6%</p><h2>The movement which would become The United Methodist Church began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England. A small group of students, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, met on the Oxford University campus. They focused on Bible study, methodical study of scripture and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the &quot;Holy Club&quot; and &quot;the Methodists&quot;, being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle. Eventually, the so-called Methodists started individual societies or classes for members of the Church of England who wanted to live a more religious life.</h2><h3>When did the movement that would become The United Methodist Church begin?</h3><p>mid-18th century</p><p>began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England.</p><p>mid-18th century</p><h3>Where did the movement that would become The United Methodist Church begin?</h3><p>within the Church of England</p><p>the Church of England.</p><p>the Church of England</p><h3>Why was the student group called &quot;the Methodists?&quot;</h3><p>being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study</p><p>They focused on Bible study, methodical study of scripture and living a holy life</p><p>being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle.</p><h2>In 1735, John and Charles Wesley went to America to teach the gospel to the American Indians in the colony of Georgia. In less than two years, the &quot;Holy Club&quot; disbanded. John Wesley returned to England and met with a group of clergy he respected. He said &quot;they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible-Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity&quot;. The ministers retained their membership in the Church of England. Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God's grace, acquired through faith in Christ. Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:</h2><h3>In what year did John and Charles Wesley come to America to teach the gospel?</h3><p>1735</p><p>In 1735</p><p>1735</p><h3>In 1735, where did John and Charles Wesley teach the gospel in America?</h3><p>colony of Georgia</p><p>the colony of Georgia</p><p>America</p><h3>In 1735, who did John and Charles Wesley teach the gospel to in America?</h3><p>American Indians</p><p>to the American Indians</p><p>American Indians</p><h3>What did &quot;The Holy Club's&quot; teachings emphasize?</h3><p>salvation by God's grace</p><p>plain, old, Bible Christianity&quot;</p><p>salvation by God's grace</p><h2>Though John Wesley originally wanted the Methodists to stay within the Church of England, the American Revolution decisively separated the Methodists in the American colonies from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church. In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Together with Coke, Wesley sent a revision of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism.</h2><h3>What caused the separation of the Methodists in the American colonies?</h3><p>American Revolution</p><p>the American Revolution</p><p>the American Revolution</p><h3>When did Wesley appoint Thomas Coke as bishop?</h3><p>1784</p><p>In 1784</p><p>1784</p><h3>Who did Wesley appoint as bishop in 1784?</h3><p>Thomas Coke</p><p>Thomas Coke</p><p>Thomas Coke</p><h3>Where was the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784 held?</h3><p>Lovely Lane Methodist Church</p><p>held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church</p><p>Lovely Lane Methodist Church</p><h3>What is considered the Mother Church of American Methodism?</h3><p>Lovely Lane Methodist Church</p><p>Lovely Lane Methodist Church,</p><p>Lovely Lane Methodist Church</p><h2>St. George's United Methodist Church, located at the corner of 4th and New Streets, in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia, is the oldest Methodist church in continuous use in the United States, beginning in 1769. The congregation was founded in 1767, meeting initially in a sail loft on Dock Street, and in 1769 it purchased the shell of a building which had been erected in 1763 by a German Reformed congregation. At this time, Methodists had not yet broken away from the Anglican Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784.</h2><h3>What church is located at the corner of 4th and New Streets in Philadelphia?</h3><p>St. George's United Methodist Church</p><p>St. George's United Methodist Church,</p><p>St. George's United Methodist Church</p><h3>What is the oldest Methodist church in continuous use in the United States?</h3><p>St. George's United Methodist Church</p><p>St. George's United Methodist Church</p><p>St. George's United Methodist Church</p><h3>When was the congregation at St. George's founded?</h3><p>1767</p><p>congregation was founded in 1767,</p><p>1767</p><h3>Where did the congregation at St. George's initially meet in 1767?</h3><p>sail loft on Dock Street</p><p>meeting initially in a sail loft on Dock Street</p><p>Dock Street</p><h3>When was the Methodist Episcopal Church founded?</h3><p>1784</p><p>the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784.</p><p>1784</p><h2>Richard Allen and Absalom Jones became the first African Americans ordained by the Methodist Church. They were licensed by St. George's Church in 1784. Three years later, protesting racial segregation in the worship services, Allen led most of the black members out of St. George's; eventually they founded the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church and the African Methodist Episcopal denomination. Absalom Jones became an Episcopal priest. In 1836, the church's basement was excavated to make room for a Sunday School. In the 1920s a court case saved the church from being demolished to make way for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. The case resulted in the bridge being relocated. Historic St Georges welcomes visitors and is home to archives and a museum on Methodism.</h2><h3>Who became the first African Americans ordained by the Methodist Church?</h3><p>Richard Allen and Absalom Jones</p><p>Richard Allen</p><p>Richard Allen and Absalom Jones</p><h3>Richard Allen and Absalom Jones were licensed by what church?</h3><p>St. George's Church</p><p>St. George's Church</p><p>St. George's Church</p><h3>Richard Allen and Absalom Jones were licensed by St. George's Church in what year?</h3><p>1784</p><p>1784</p><p>1784</p><h2>In the more than 220 years since 1784, Methodism in the United States, like many other Protestant denominations, has seen a number of divisions and mergers. In 1830, the Methodist Protestant Church split from the Methodist Episcopal Church over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church, insisting that clergy should not be the only ones to have any determination in how the church was to be operated. In 1844, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.</h2><h3>When did the Methodist Protestant Church split from the Methodist Episcopal Church?</h3><p>1830</p><p>In 1830</p><p>1830</p><h3>Why did the Methodist Protestant Church split from the Methodist Episcopal Church?</h3><p>issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church</p><p>over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church</p><p>over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church</p><h3>When did the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences?</h3><p>1844</p><p>In 1844,</p><p>1844</p><h3>Why did the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences?</h3><p>because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination</p><p>because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.</p><p>tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination</p><h2>On April 23, 1968, the United Methodist Church was created when the Evangelical United Brethren Church (represented by Bishop Reuben H. Mueller) and The Methodist Church (represented by Bishop Lloyd Christ Wicke) joined hands at the constituting General Conference in Dallas, Texas. With the words, &quot;Lord of the Church, we are united in Thee, in Thy Church and now in The United Methodist Church&quot; the new denomination was given birth by the two churches that had distinguished histories and influential ministries in various parts of the world.</h2><h3>When was the United Methodist Church created?</h3><p>April 23, 1968</p><p>On April 23, 1968</p><p>1968</p><h3>Where did two leaders join hands and &quot;give birth&quot; to a new denomination?</h3><p>constituting General Conference in Dallas, Texas</p><p>the constituting General Conference in Dallas, Texas.</p><p>Dallas</p><h3>Who was one man who joined hands and said &quot;Lord of the Church, we are united in Thee...?&quot;</h3><p>Bishop Lloyd Christ Wicke</p><p>Bishop Lloyd Christ</p><p>Bishop Reuben H.

The Book of Discipline also recognizes the importance of the Chalcedonian Creed of the Council of Chalcedon. It upholds the concept of the &quot;visible and invisible Church,&quot; meaning that all who are truly believers in every age belong to the holy Church invisible, while the United Methodist Church is a branch of the Church visible, to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the Word of God is preached and the Sacraments are administered.</h2><h3>The UMC understands itself to be part of what church?</h3><p>holy catholic (or universal) church</p><p>the holy catholic (or universal) church</p><p>holy catholic (or universal) church</p><h3>What book recognizes the importance of the Chalcedonian Creed?</h3><p>The Book of Discipline</p><p>.

As a result of the American Revolution, John Wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters, Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat. Dr. Thomas Coke, already an Anglican priest, assisted Wesley in this action. Coke was then &quot;set apart&quot; as a superintendent (bishop) by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there. In defense of his action to ordain, Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria, which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore, bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate. He knew that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by the ancient church. Methodists today who would argue for apostolic succession would do so on these grounds.</h2><h3>Why was Wesley compelled to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters?</h3><p>result of the American Revolution</p><p>As a result of the American Revolution,</p><p>the American Revolution</p><h3>Who assisted Wesley with ordaining Whatcoat and Vasey as presbyters?</h3><p>Dr. Thomas Coke</p><p>Dr. Thomas Coke</p><p>Dr. Thomas Coke</p><h3>Who were the two lay preachers that Wesley ordained as presbyters?</h3><p>Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat.</p><p>Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat</p><p>Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat</p><h2>While many United Methodist congregations operate in the evangelical tradition, others reflect the mainline Protestant traditions. Although United Methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time, these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church's founders, especially John Wesley and Charles Wesley (Anglicans), but also Philip William Otterbein and Martin Boehm (United Brethren), and Jacob Albright (Evangelical Association). With the formation of The United Methodist Church in 1968, theologian Albert C. Outler led the team which systematized denominational doctrine. Outler's work proved pivotal in the work of union, and he is largely considered the first United Methodist theologian.</h2><h3>When was the UMC formed?</h3><p>1968</p><p>1968</p><p>1968</p><h3>Who were two of the founders of the United Methodist Church?</h3><p>John Wesley and Charles Wesley</p><p>John Wesley and Charles Wesley</p><p>John Wesley and Charles Wesley</p><h3>In 1968, who led the team which systematized denominational doctrine?</h3><p>Albert C.

It is that power which enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. This grace is the present work of God to turn us from our sin-corrupted human will to the loving will of the Father. In this work, God desires that we might sense both our sinfulness before God and God's offer of salvation. Prevenient grace allows those tainted by sin to nevertheless make a truly free choice to accept or reject God's salvation in Christ.</h2><h3>What is the grace that &quot;goes before us?&quot;</h3><p>Prevenient grace</p><p>Prevenient grace,</p><p>Prevenient grace</p><h3>What is that power that enables us to love?</h3><p>Prevenient grace</p><p>God</p><p>Prevenient grace</p><h3>What is Prevenient grace?</h3><p>the grace that &quot;goes before&quot; us</p><p>It is that power which enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.</p><p>that power which enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.</p><h3>Prevenient grace allowas those tainted by what to make a choice to accept or reject God's salvation in Christ?</h3><p>Prevenient grace</p><p>sin</p><p>sin</p><h2>Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace is that grace, offered by God to all people, that we receive by faith and trust in Christ, through which God pardons the believer of sin. It is in justifying grace we are received by God, in spite of our sin. In this reception, we are forgiven through the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the cross. The justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love God and neighbor. Today, justifying grace is also known as conversion, &quot;accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior,&quot; or being &quot;born again&quot;. John Wesley originally called this experience the New Birth. This experience can occur in different ways; it can be one transforming moment, such as an altar call experience, or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time.</h2><h3>What is the grace that we receive by faith and trust in God?</h3><p>Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace</p><p>Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace</p><p>Justifying Grace</p><h3>What cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love God and neighbor?</h3><p>justifying grace</p><p>The justifying grace</p><p>justifying grace</p><h3>What is justifying grace also known as today?</h3><p>conversion</p><p>conversion</p><p>conversion</p><h3>What is another name for being born again?</h3><p>conversion</p><p>conversion, &quot;accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior,&quot; or being &quot;born again</p><p>justifying grace</p><h3>What did John Wesley originally call the experience of conversion?</h3><p>New Birth</p><p>John Wesley originally called this experience the New Birth.</p><p>New Birth</p><h2>Sanctifying Grace is that grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey toward Christian Perfection: a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and a genuine love of our neighbors as ourselves. Sanctifying grace enables us to respond to God by leading a Spirit-filled and Christ-like life aimed toward love. Wesley never claimed this state of perfection for himself but instead insisted the attainment of perfection was possible for all Christians. Here the English Reformer parted company with both Luther and Calvin, who denied that a man would ever reach a state in this life in which he could not fall into sin. Such a man can lose all inclination to evil and can gain perfection in this life.</h2><h3>What is Sanctifying Grace?</h3><p>grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey toward Christian Perfection</p><p>is that grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey toward Christian Perfection</p><p>that grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey toward Christian Perfection</p><h3>What is that grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey towards Christian Perfection?</h3><p>Sanctifying Grace</p><p>a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength,</p><p>Sanctifying Grace</p><h3>What is Christian Perfection?</h3><p>a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and a genuine love of our neighbors as ourselves</p><p>leading a Spirit-filled and Christ-like life aimed toward love</p><p>a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind</p><h3>What is a genuine love of God with heart, soul and mind?</h3><p>Christian Perfection</p><p>Christian Perfection</p><p>Christian Perfection</p><h2>Wesleyan theology stands at a unique cross-roads between evangelical and sacramental, between liturgical and charismatic, and between Anglo-Catholic and Reformed theology and practice. It has been characterized as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer. The United Methodist Church believes in prima scriptura, seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred tradition, reason, and experience to interpret it, with the aid of the Holy Spirit (see Wesleyan Quadrilateral). Therefore, according to The Book of Discipline, United Methodist theology is at once &quot;catholic, evangelical, and reformed.&quot; Today, the UMC is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race, gender, and ideology, though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes. Comparatively, the UMC stands to the right of liberal and progressive Protestant groups such as the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church on certain issues (especially regarding sexuality), but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the Southern Baptists and Pentecostalism, in regard to theological matters such as social justice and Biblical interpretation. However, it should be noted that the UMC is made up of a broad diversity of thought, and so there are many clergy and laity within the UMC that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters.</h2><h3>What has been characterized as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit?</h3><p>Wesleyan theology</p><p>Wesleyan theology</p><p>Wesleyan theology</p><h3>What is seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church?</h3><p>prima scriptura</p><p>Wesleyan theology s</p><p>prima scriptura</p><h3>Today, which church is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations?</h3><p>UMC</p><p>the UMC</p><p>the UMC</p><h3>What states that United Methodist theology is at once &quot;catholic, evangelical and reformed?&quot;</h3><p>Book of Discipline</p><p>Book of Discipline</p><p>The Book of Discipline</p><h2>The United Methodist Church upholds the sanctity of human life both of the child and the mother. As a result, the church is &quot;reluctant to affirm abortion as an acceptable practice,&quot; and condemns the use of late-term or partial birth abortion except as a medical necessity. The denomination as a whole is committed to &quot;assist[ing] the ministry of crisis pregnancy centers and pregnancy resource centers that compassionately help women find feasible alternatives to abortion.&quot; Still, the denomination is pro-choice and also &quot;was a founding member of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice...[and] 2008 General Conference [went] on record in support of the work of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice&quot;.</h2><h3>When did the General Conference go on record in support of the work of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice?</h3><p>2008</p><p>2008</p><p>2008</p><h3>Is the UMC pro-life or pro-choice?</h3><p>pro-choice</p><p>pro-choice</p><p>pro-choice</p><h3>The UMC was a founding member of what coalition?</h3><p>Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice</p><p>Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice.</p><p>the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice</p><h2>The church also holds that they &quot;are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother, for whom devastating damage may result from an unacceptable pregnancy.

At one time, Methodist ministers had to take a pledge not to drink and encouraged their congregations to do the same. Today the United Methodist Church states that it &quot;affirms our long-standing support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to God's liberating and redeeming love for persons.&quot; In fact, the United Methodist Church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of Holy Communion, thus &quot;expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enabling the participation of children and youth, and supporting the church's witness of abstinence.&quot; Moreover, in 2011 and 2012, The United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society called on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for Lent.</h2><h3>Historically, which movement has the Methodist Church supported?</h3><p>temperance movement</p><p>temperance movement.</p><p>the temperance movement</p><h3>When did the UMC's General Board of Church and Society call on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for Lent?</h3><p>2011 and 2012</p><p>in 2011 and 2012</p><p>2011 and 2012</p><h3>What was the name of Wesley's famous sermon in which he warned against the dangers of drinking?</h3><p>The Use of Money</p><p>The Use of Money,</p><p>&quot;The Use of Money,&quot;</p><h3>What does the United Methodist Church use in the sacrament of the Holy Communion?</h3><p>unfermented grape juice</p><p>uses unfermented grape juice</p><p>unfermented grape juice</p><h2>The United Methodist Church, along with other Methodist churches, condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.

The United Methodist Church also believes that Jesus explicitly repudiated the lex talionis in Matthew 5:38-39 and abolished the death penalty in John 8:7.

It forbids any United Methodist board, agency, committee, commission, or council to give United Methodist funds to any gay organization or group, or otherwise use such funds to promote the acceptance of homosexuality. Other ministers have been defrocked for officiating at same-sex weddings and several trials of others are scheduled. Still, some congregations have sought other ways to recognize same-sex couples. For example, one congregation hosted a proposal for a same-sex couple announcing their engagement. Moreover, some churches, especially in 2016 after same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide, have provided blessings for same-sex marriages. In April of 2016, a United Methodist bishop made a bold statement by performing a same-sex marriage in church as a clear sign of his advocacy for change.</h2><h3>The UMC prohibits the celebration of what type of unions?</h3><p>same-sex unions</p><p>prohibits the celebration of same-sex unions.</p><p>same-sex</p><h3>In what year was the trial of Rev.

Additionally, many organizations, conferences, and congregations have recently called for broader acceptance of the LGBT community within the UMC. For example, the Connectional Table, a governing committee, has voted in favor of a proposal that calls for a localized option, which would permit ministers to officiate same-sex weddings, and it would allow conferences to ordain gay clergy.

In 2005, clergy credentials were removed from Irene Elizabeth Stroud after she was convicted in a church trial of violating church law by engaging in a lesbian relationship; this conviction was later upheld by the Judicial Council, the highest court in the denomination. The Judicial Council also affirmed that a Virginia pastor had the right to deny local church membership to a man in an openly gay relationship. This affirmation, however, was based upon a senior pastor's right to judge the readiness of a congregant to join as a full member of the church. However, at the same time, the UMC Judicial Council, in 2008, ruled that conferences can determine their own policy related to transgender pastors, and therefore some regional conferences have voted to recognize ordained transgender pastors. The Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC has approved the appointment of an openly partnered lesbian to the provisional diaconate.</h2><h3>In what year was Rose Mary Denman defrocked for openly living with a same-sex partner?</h3><p>1987</p><p>1987</p><p>1987</p><h3>In what year was Irene Elizabeth Stroud convicted in a church trial?</h3><p>2005</p><p>2005</p><p>2005</p><h3>What group has approved the appointment of an openly partnered lesbian to the provisional diaconate?</h3><p>Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC</p><p>The Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC</p><p>The Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC</p><h2>The United Methodist Church opposes conscription as incompatible with the teaching of Scripture.

However, the United Methodist Church also supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously choose to serve in the armed forces or to accept alternative service.

It insists that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve by peaceful means every dispute that arises between or among them; that human values must outweigh military claims as governments determine their priorities; that the militarization of society must be challenged and stopped; that the manufacture, sale, and deployment of armaments must be reduced and controlled; and that the production, possession, or use of nuclear weapons be condemned.

Some clergy offer healing services, while exorcism is an occasional practice by some clergy in The United Methodist Church in Africa. These services involve the laying on of hands and anointing with oil. Along with these, there are also special services for holy days such as All Saints Day, Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Vigil. These services are contained in The United Methodist Hymnal and The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992). Many of these liturgies are derived from the Anglican tradition's Book of Common Prayer.

The highest level is called the General Conference and is the only organization which may speak officially for the church. The General Conference meets every four years (quadrennium). Legislative changes are recorded in The Book of Discipline which is revised after each General Conference. Non-legislative resolutions are recorded in the Book of Resolutions, which is published after each General Conference, and expire after eight years unless passed again by a subsequent session of General Conference. The last General Conference was held in Tampa, Florida, in 2012. The event is currently rotated between the U.S. jurisdictions of the church. The 2016 General Conference will be in Portland, Oregon. Bishops, Councils, Committees, Boards, Elders, etc., are not permitted to speak on behalf of The United Methodist Church as this authority is reserved solely for the General Conference in accordance with the Book of Discipline.</h2><h3>What church is organized into conferences?</h3><p>United Methodist Church</p><p>The United Methodist Church</p><p>The United Methodist Church</p><h3>What is the only organization which may speak officially for the church?</h3><p>General Conference</p><p>General Conference a</p><p>the General Conference</p><h3>What book is revised after every General Conference?</h3><p>The Book of Discipline</p><p>The Book of Discipline</p><p>The Book of Discipline</p><h3>What is the highest level of the UMC?</h3><p>General Conference</p><p>General Conference</p><p>the General Conference</p><h3>How often does the General Conference meet?</h3><p>every four years</p><p>every four years (quadrennium).</p><p>every four years</p><h2>Subordinate to the General Conference are the jurisdictional and central conferences which also meet every four years.

It consists of nine members, both laity and clergy, elected by the General Conference for an eight-year term. The ratio of laity to clergy alternates every eight years. The Judicial Council interprets the Book of Discipline between sessions of General Conference, and during General Conference, the Judicial Council rules on the constitutionality of laws passed by General Conference. The Council also determines whether actions of local churches, annual conferences, church agencies, and bishops are in accordance with church law. The Council reviews all decisions of law made by bishops The Judicial Council cannot create any legislation; it can only interpret existing legislation.

The term Annual Conference is often used to refer to the geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting. Clergy are members of their Annual Conference rather than of any local congregation, and are appointed to a local church or other charge annually by the conference's resident Bishop at the meeting of the Annual Conference. In many ways, the United Methodist Church operates in a connectional organization of the Annual Conferences, and actions taken by one conference are not binding upon another.</h2><h3>What is the basic unit of organization within the UMC?</h3><p>The Annual Conference</p><p>synod</p><p>The Annual Conference</p><h3>The term Annual Conference is often used to refer to what?</h3><p>geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting</p><p>geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting.

All churches must also have a nominations committee, a finance committee and a church council or administrative council. Other committees are suggested but not required such as a missions committee, or evangelism or worship committee. Term limits are set for some committees but not for all.

Today, the clergy includes men and women who are ordained by bishops as elders and deacons and are appointed to various ministries. Elders in the United Methodist Church itenerate and are subject to the authority and appointment of their bishops. They generally serve as pastors in local congregations. Deacons are in service ministry and may serve as musicians, liturgists, educators, business administrators, and a number of other areas. Elders and deacons are required to obtain a master's degree (generally an M.Div.), or another equivalent degree, before commissioning and then ultimately ordination.

Many Annual Conferences try to avoid making appointment changes between sessions of Annual Conference.

The licensed local pastor has the authority of a pastor only within the context and during the time of the appointment and shall not extend beyond it. Local pastors are not required to have advanced degrees but are required to attend licensing school and attend and pass an approved five-year course of study at an approved United Methodist seminary or course of study school, successfully complete written and oral examinations, and appear before the District Committee on Ministry and the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry. They may continue towards Associate Membership allowing them to retire as clergy. They also may continue towards ordination if they complete their bachelor's degree, requirements of their particular Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, as well as an advanced course or study or prescribed seminary courses at an approved seminary.

The United Methodist Church is active in ecumenical relations with other Christian groups and denominations. It is a member of the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, Churches Uniting in Christ, and Christian Churches Together. In addition, it voted to seek observer status in the National Association of Evangelicals and in the World Evangelical Fellowship. However, there are some in The United Methodist Church who feel that false ecumenism might result in the &quot;blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity.&quot;</h2><h3>What is one tradition within the Christian Church?</h3><p>United Methodist Church</p><p>The United Methodist Church is</p><p>The United Methodist Church</p><h3>What type of status did the UMC vote to seek in the National Association of Evangelicals?</h3><p>observer status</p><p>it voted to seek observer status</p><p>observer</p><h3>Some in the UMC feel that false ecumenism might result in what?</h3><p>blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity</p><p>&quot;blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity</p><p>the &quot;blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity.&quot;</p><h2>The United Methodist Church has since 1985 been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American Methodist denominations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. A Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger. In May 2012, The United Methodist Church entered into full communion with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church, in which these Churches agreed to &quot;recognize each other's churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries.&quot;</h2><h3>In what year was the Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union formed?</h3><p>2000</p><p>2000</p><p>2000</p><h3>When did the UMC enter into full communion with several churches?</h3><p>May 2012</p><p>May 2012</p><p>2012</p><h3>Since what year has the UMC been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American denominations?</h3><p>1985</p><p>since 1985</p><p>1985</p><h2>Like many other mainline Protestant denominations in the United States, the United Methodist Church has experienced significant membership losses in recent decades. At the time of its formation, the UMC had about 11 million members in nearly 42,000 congregations. In 1975, membership dropped below 10 million for the first time. In 2005, there were about 8 million members in over 34,000 congregations. Membership is concentrated primarily in the Midwest and in the South. Texas has the largest number of members, with about 1 million. The states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma, Iowa, Mississippi, West Virginia, and North Carolina.</h2><h3>At the time of its formation, how many members did the UMC have?</h3><p>11 million</p><p>about 11 million members in nearly 42,000 congregations</p><p>11 million</p><h3>At the time of its formation, how many congregations did the UMC have?</h3><p>42,000</p><p>42,000 congregations</p><p>42,000</p><h3>In 2005, approximately how many members were in the UMC?</h3><p>8 million</p><p>8 million</p><p>8 million</p><h3>In 2005, approximately how many congregations were in the UMC?</h3><p>34,000</p><p>34,000 congregations</p><p>34,000</p><h3>Which state has the largest number of members?</h3><p>Texas</p><p>Texas</p><p>Texas</p><h2>By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the U.S. and 3.5 million overseas. Significantly, about 20% of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10%. During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the Methodist Church of the Ivory Coast and its 700,000 members into the denomination. Given current trends in the UMC—with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and U.S. churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week—it has been estimated that Africans will make up at least 30% of the delegates at the 2012 General Conference, and it is also possible that 40% of the delegates will be from outside the U.S. One Congolese bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States.</h2><h3>By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, what was the total UMC membership?</h3><p>11.4 million</p><p>11.4 million</p><p>11.4 million</p><h3>By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, what was the total UMC membership in the U.S.?</h3><p>7.9 million</p><p>7.9 million in the U.S</p><p>7.9 million</p><h3>By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, what was the total UMC membership overseas?</h3><p>3.5 million</p><p>3.5 million</p><p>3.5 million</p><h2>The UMC is also a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium, which seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today's Church. It is also active in the World Methodist Council, an interdenominational group composed of various churches in the tradition of John Wesley to promote the Gospel throughout the world. On July 18, 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Council voted unanimously to adopt the &quot;Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification&quot;, which was approved in 1999 by the Vatican and the Lutheran World Federation.</h2><h3>Which group seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today's church?</h3><p>Wesleyan Holiness Consortium</p><p>Wesleyan Holiness Consortium</p><p>Wesleyan Holiness Consortium</p><h3>What is an interdenominational group composed of various churches to promote the Gospel throughout the world?</h3><p>World Methodist Council</p><p>World Methodist Council</p><p>World Methodist Council</p><h3>When did delegates to the World Methodist Council vote to adopt the joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification?&quot;</h3><p>July 18, 2006</p><p>On July 18, 2006</p><p>July 18, 2006</p></div></body></html>
