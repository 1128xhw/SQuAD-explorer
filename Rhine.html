<html><body><div><h1>Rhine</h1><h2>The Rhine (Romansh: Rein, German: Rhein, French: le Rhin, Dutch: Rijn) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein border, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The biggest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about 1,230 km (760 mi),[note 2][note 1] with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s (100,000 cu ft/s).</h2><h3>Where does the Rhine begin? </h3><p>Swiss canton</p><p>s in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps,</p><p>Graubünden</p><p>Graubünden</p><h3>Where does the Rhine empty?</h3><p>North Sea</p><p>the North Sea in the Netherlands</p><p>North Sea</p><p>North Sea</p><h3>What is the largest city the Rhine runs through? </h3><p>Cologne, Germany</p><p>Cologne, Germany</p><p>Cologne</p><h3>What river is larger than the Rhine?</h3><p>Danube</p><p>the Danube</p><p>Danube</p><p>Danube</p><h3>How long is the Rhine?</h3><p>1,230 km (760 mi)</p><p>1,230 km (760 mi)</p><p>1,230 km</p><p>1,230 km</p><h3>Where is the Rhine? </h3><p>Europe</p><p>Central and Western Europe</p><p>Germany</p><p>Germany</p><h3>What country does the Rhine empty?</h3><p>Netherlands</p><p>Germany</p><p>Netherlands</p><p>Netherlands</p><h3>How long is the Rhine? </h3><p>1,230 km</p><p>1,230 km (760 mi)</p><p>1,230 km</p><p>1,230 km</p><h2>The variant forms of the name of the Rhine in modern languages are all derived from the Gaulish name Rēnos, which was adapted in Roman-era geography (1st century BC) as Greek Ῥῆνος (Rhēnos), Latin Rhenus.[note 3] The spelling with Rh- in English Rhine as well as in German Rhein and French Rhin is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the vocalisation -i- is due to the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as *Rīnaz, via Old Frankish giving Old English Rín, Old High German Rīn, Dutch Rijn (formerly also spelled Rhijn)). The diphthong in modern German Rhein (also adopted in Romansh Rein, Rain) is a Central German development of the early modern period, the Alemannic name Rī(n) retaining the older vocalism,[note 4] as does Ripuarian Rhing, while Palatine has diphthongized Rhei, Rhoi. Spanish is with French in adopting the Germanic vocalism Rin-, while Italian, Occitan and Portuguese retain the Latin Ren-.</h2><h3>Where does the name Rhine derive from? </h3><p>Gaulish name Rēnos</p><p>Rēnos</p><p>the Gaulish name Rēnos</p><p>Rēnos</p><p>Rēnos</p><h3>What is the French name for the Rhine? </h3><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><h3>What is the Proto-Germanic adaptation of the name of the Rhine?</h3><p>Rīnaz</p><p>Rīnaz</p><p>*Rīnaz</p><p>Rīnaz</p><p>Rīnaz</p><h3>What century did the name of the Rhine come from?</h3><p>1st century BC</p><p>1st</p><p>Roman-era</p><p>1st century BC</p><h3>What does the name The Rhine come from? </h3><p>Gaulish name Rēnos</p><p>Rhenus</p><p>the Gaulish name Rēnos</p><p>1st century BC</p><p>Rēnos</p><h3>What is the Rhine called in French?</h3><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><p>Rhin</p><h3>What is the Rhine called in Dutch?</h3><p>Rijn</p><p>Rijn</p><p>Rijn</p><p>Rijn</p><p>Rijn</p><h3>What is the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name of the Rhine?</h3><p>Rīnaz</p><p>Rīnaz</p><p>Rīnaz</p><p>Rīnaz</p><p>Rīnaz</p><h3>How was the Dutch name for the Rhine originally spelled? </h3><p>Rhijn</p><p>Rhijn</p><p>Rhijn</p><p>Rhijn</p><p>Rhijn</p><h2>The length of the Rhine is conventionally measured in &quot;Rhine-kilometers&quot; (Rheinkilometer), a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the Old Rhine Bridge at Constance (0 km) to Hoek van Holland (1036.20 km). The river length is significantly shortened from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century.[note 7] The &quot;total length of the Rhine&quot;, to the inclusion of Lake Constance and the Alpine Rhine is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres (766 miles) by the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat in 2010.[note 1]</h2><h3>What is the conventional method to measure the Rhine? </h3><p>Rhine-kilometers</p><p>Rhine-kilometers</p><p>&quot;Rhine-kilometers&quot;</p><p>Rhine-kilometers</p><p>Rhine-kilometers</p><h3>When was the scale to measure the Rhine introduced? </h3><p>1939</p><p>1939</p><p>1939</p><p>1939</p><p>1939</p><h3>Where does the Rhine river's measurement begin?</h3><p>Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>the Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>Old Rhine Bridge</p><h3>Where does the Rhine river's measurement end?</h3><p>Hoek van Holland</p><p>Hoek van Holland</p><p>(1036.20 km)</p><p>Hoek van Holland</p><p>Hoek van Holland</p><h3>What has shortened the Rhine river? </h3><p>canalisation projects</p><p>canalisation projects</p><p>the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century</p><p>canalisation projects</p><p>canalisation projects</p><h3>What is the conventional measurement of the Rhine? </h3><p>Rhine-kilometers&quot;</p><p>Rhine-kilometers</p><p>kilometres</p><p>Rhine-kilometers</p><p>Rhine-kilometers</p><h3>When was the measurement of the Rhine introduced? </h3><p>1939</p><p>1939</p><p>1939</p><p>1939</p><h3>Where does the Rhine begin? </h3><p>Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>the Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>Old Rhine Bridge at Constance</p><p>Old Rhine Bridge</p><h3>Why has the Rhine been shortened?</h3><p>canalisation projects</p><p>canalisation projects</p><p>from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century</p><p>canalisation projects</p><p>canalisation projects</p><h3>Where does the Rhine end?</h3><p>Hoek van Holland</p><p>Hoek van Holland</p><p>Hoek van Holland</p><p>Hoek van Holland</p><p>Hoek van Holland</p><h2>Near Tamins-Reichenau the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine join and form the Rhine.

It includes the Austrian towns of Gaißau, Höchst and Fußach. The natural Rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments. In the local Alemannic dialect, the singular is pronounced &quot;Isel&quot; and this is also the local pronunciation of Esel (&quot;Donkey&quot;).

The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. The water then follows the northern shore until Hagnau am Bodensee. A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake Überlingen. Most of the water flows via the Constance hopper into the Rheinrinne (&quot;Rhine Gutter&quot;) and Seerhein.

Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam. The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water. It contributes 70 m3/s (2,500 cu ft/s) to the Rhine. Other rivers in the Ruhr Area, above all, the Emscher, still carry a considerable degree of pollution.</h2><h3>What contributed to water pollution in the Rhine? </h3><p>plants and factories</p><p>industry</p><p>industry</p><h3>What is Europe's largest inland port?</h3><p>Duisburg</p><p>Duisburg</p><p>Duisburg</p><h3>What rive joins the Rhine in Duisburg? </h3><p>Ruhr</p><p>Ruhr</p><p>The Ruhr</p><h3>What does the Ruhr provide to it's community?</h3><p>drinking water</p><p>drinking water</p><p>drinking water</p><h3>Where are a bulk of factories concentrated along the Rhine?</h3><p>Switzerland</p><p>Lower Rhine</p><p>Lower Rhine</p><h3>What did industry do to the Rhine until the 1980s?</h3><p>pollution</p><p>pollution</p><p>water pollution</p><h3>Which section of the Rhine is most factories found?</h3><p>Lower Rhine</p><p>Lower Rhine</p><p>Lower Rhine</p><h3>What country has the most factories that pollute the Rhine?</h3><p>Switzerland</p><p>Duisburg</p><p>Switzerland</p><h3>What city has the largest inland port in Europe?</h3><p>Duisburg</p><p>Duisburg</p><p>Duisburg</p><h3>Which river joins the Rhine in Duisburg?</h3><p>Ruhr</p><p>Ruhr</p><p>The Ruhr</p><h2>The dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism.

Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the agglomerations Cologne, Düsseldorf and Ruhr area. Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr region. One of the most important cities in this region is Duisburg with the largest river port in Europe (Duisport). The region downstream of Duisburg is more agricultural. In Wesel, 30 km downstream of Duisburg, is located the western end of the second east-west shipping route, the Wesel-Datteln Canal, which runs parallel to the Lippe. Between Emmerich and Cleves the Emmerich Rhine Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in Germany, crosses the 400 m wide river. Near Krefeld, the river crosses the Uerdingen line, the line which separates the areas where Low German and High German are spoken.</h2><h3>What city has the biggest port in Germany?</h3><p>Duisburg</p><p>Duisburg</p><p>Duisburg</p><h3>What is the Canal in Wesel? </h3><p>Wesel-Datteln Canal</p><p>Wesel-Datteln Canal</p><p>Wesel-Datteln Canal</p><h3>What does the Wessel-Datteln canal run parallel to?</h3><p>Lippe</p><p>Lippe</p><p>Lippe</p><h3>What is the largest suspension bridge in Germany?</h3><p>Emmerich Rhine Bridge</p><p>Emmerich Rhine Bridge</p><p>Emmerich Rhine Bridge,</p><h3>How wide is the Rhine in Germany between Emmrich and Cleves?</h3><p>400 m</p><p>400 m</p><p>400 m</p><h3>What part of the Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia?</h3><p>Lower Rhine</p><p>Lower</p><p>Lower Rhine</p><h3>What is the region called that is the largest conurbation of the Rhine?</h3><p>Rhine-Ruhr</p><p>Rhine-Ruhr</p><p>Rhine-Ruhr region</p><h3>What is the largest port in Europe called?</h3><p>Duisport</p><p>Duisport</p><p>Duisburg</p><h3>What is the name of the longest bridge in Germany?</h3><p>Emmerich Rhine Bridge</p><p>Emmerich Rhine Bridge</p><p>Emmerich Rhine Bridge</p><h3>How wide is the Rhine in Germany?</h3><p>400 m wide</p><p>400 m</p><p>400 m</p><h2>From here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the Dutch name Rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water.

The Beneden Merwede branches off, near Hardinxveld-Giessendam and continues as the Noord, to join the Lek, near the village of Kinderdijk, to form the Nieuwe Maas; then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het Scheur and the Nieuwe Waterweg, to the North Sea.

This creates three main flows, two of which change names rather often. The largest and southern main branch begins as Waal and continues as Boven Merwede (&quot;Upper Merwede&quot;), Beneden Merwede (&quot;Lower Merwede&quot;), Noord River (&quot;North River&quot;), Nieuwe Maas (&quot;New Meuse&quot;), Het Scheur (&quot;the Rip&quot;) and Nieuwe Waterweg (&quot;New Waterway&quot;).

From 1421 to 1904, the Meuse and Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem to form Merwede.

The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.</h2><h3>The present Mediterranean Sea descends from what sea?</h3><p>Tethys sea</p><p>Tethys</p><p>Tethys sea</p><h3>What period did plates reverse directions to compress the Tethys floor?</h3><p>Jurassic Period</p><p>Jurassic Period</p><p>Jurassic Period</p><h3>Microplates squeezing and rotating created the features of what?</h3><p>Mediterranean geography</p><p>Mediterranean geography</p><p>Mediterranean geography</p><h3>What period opened the Tethys Ocean?</h3><p>Mesozoic Era</p><p>Triassic Period</p><p>Triassic Period</p><h3>What pushed up the Pyrenees?</h3><p>Iberia</p><p>Iberia</p><p>Iberia</p><h2>From the Eocene onwards, the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a N–S rift system to develop in this zone.

By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben, that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river. At that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps; instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.</h2><h3>What rift system developed in the Alpine orogeny?</h3><p>N–S</p><p>N–S</p><p>N–S rift system</p><h3>What elements from the rift system in the Alpine orogeny in Southwest Germany?</h3><p>Upper Rhine Graben</p><p>Upper Rhine Graben</p><p>Upper Rhine Graben</p><h3>What time did a river system develop in the Upper Rhine Graben?</h3><p>Miocene</p><p>By the time of the Miocene</p><p>time of the Miocene</p><h3>The Rhine and what other river drained the northern flanks of the alps?</h3><p>Danube</p><p>Danube</p><p>Danube</p><h2>Through stream capture, the Rhine extended its watershed southward.

In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine. During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas, in what is now the Netherlands.</h2><h3>What period was 2.5 million years ago?</h3><p>Ice Ages</p><p>geological period</p><p>geological period of the Ice Ages</p><h3>How many major ice ages have occurred? </h3><p>six</p><p>six</p><p>six</p><h3>How far did the sea level drop in the ice ages?</h3><p>120 m</p><p>120 m</p><p>120 m</p><h3>In early Pleistocene, what direction did the Rhine flow?</h3><p>northwest</p><p>northwest</p><p>northwest</p><h3>During glacial times, where was the mouth of the Rhine located?</h3><p>Brest</p><p>Brest, France</p><p>offshore of Brest,</p><h2>The last glacial ran from ~74,000 (BP = Before Present), until the end of the Pleistocene (~11,600 BP).

During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean.

As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.</h2><h3>When have humans started impacting the delta?</h3><p>3000 yr BP</p><p>~3000 yr BP</p><p>~3000 yr BP</p><h3>What has increased sediment and delta growth also produced in the Rhine?</h3><p>increased flooding and sedimentation</p><p>Bronze Age agriculture</p><p>increased flooding and sedimentation</p><h3>What increased in the Rhine because of the land clearance in the upland areas?</h3><p>sediment load</p><p>sediment load</p><p>sediment load</p><h3>When did embankment of the major Rhine distributaries take palce?</h3><p>11–13th century</p><p>11–13th century AD</p><p>11–13th century AD</p><h3>How many avulsions have occurred in the past 6000 yeas?</h3><p>80</p><p>80</p><p>80</p><h2>At present, the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea, through the former Meuse estuary, near Rotterdam. The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer, formerly the Zuider Zee brackish lagoon; however, since 1932, a freshwater lake. The discharge of the Rhine is divided among three branches: the River Waal (6/9 of total discharge), the River Nederrijn – Lek (2/9 of total discharge) and the River IJssel (1/9 of total discharge). This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709, by river engineering works, including the digging of the Pannerdens canal and since the 20th century, with the help of weirs in the Nederrijn river.</h2><h3>Where do the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to?</h3><p>North Sea</p><p>North Sea</p><p>North Sea</p><p>North Sea</p><h3>What do the Waal and the Nederrijn-Lek discharge throguh?</h3><p>Meuse estuary</p><p>Meuse estuary</p><p>Meuse estuary</p><p>Meuse estuary</p><h3>Where does the Ijssel branch flow?</h3><p>IJsselmeer</p><p>IJsselmeer</p><p>IJsselmeer</p><p>IJsselmeer</p><h3>What did the Zuider Zee brackish lagoon change into?</h3><p>freshwater lake</p><p>freshwater lake</p><p>freshwater lake</p><p>freshwater lake</p><h3>How many branches does the Rhine branch into?</h3><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><h2>The Rhine was not known to Herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC in Roman-era geography. At that time, it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania. The Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC, and by the 1st century BC, the areal of the La Tène culture covered almost its entire length, forming a contact zone with the Jastorf culture, i.e. the locus of early Celtic-Germanic cultural contact. In Roman geography, the Rhine formed the boundary between Gallia and Germania by definition; e.g. Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil (8.727) (Rhenus) fluvius Galliae, qui Germanos a Gallia dividit &quot;(The Rhine is a) river of Gaul, which divides the Germanic people from Gaul.&quot;</h2><h3>When was the Rhine first discovered?</h3><p>1st century BC</p><p>1st century BC</p><p>1st century BC</p><h3>The Rhine first formed a boundary between Gaul and what else?</h3><p>Germania</p><p>Germania</p><p>Germania</p><h3>Since when was the Rhine part of the areal of Hallstatt culture?</h3><p>6th century BC</p><p>6th century BC</p><p>6th century BC</p><h3>Who first wrote about the Rhine's discovery and border?</h3><p>Maurus Servius Honoratus</p><p>Maurus Servius Honoratus</p><h2>From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.</h2><h3>When did Augustus die?</h3><p>AD 14</p><p>AD 14</p><p>AD 14</p><h3>The Rhine and what other river were accepted as the Germanic frontier?</h3><p>Danube</p><p>upper Danube</p><p>upper Danube</p><h3>When did the Rhine stop being the Roman boundary?</h3><p>the empire fell</p><p>until the empire fell</p><p>until the empire fell</p><h3>Which direction did Romans use to drift through the Rhine?</h3><p>eastwards</p><p>eastwards</p><p>eastwards</p><h3>Where are the upper Rhine and upper Danube crossed?</h3><p>southern</p><p>between the modern Baden and Württemberg</p><h2>The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine. The actual number of legions present at any base or in all, depended on whether a state or threat of war existed. Between about AD 14 and 180, the assignment of legions was as follows: for the army of Germania Inferior, two legions at Vetera (Xanten), I Germanica and XX Valeria (Pannonian troops); two legions at oppidum Ubiorum (&quot;town of the Ubii&quot;), which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina, descending to Cologne, V Alaudae, a Celtic legion recruited from Gallia Narbonensis and XXI, possibly a Galatian legion from the other side of the empire.</h2><h3>How many legions in five bases were along the Rhine by the Romans?</h3><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><p>eight</p><h3>Vetra and I Germanica and XX Valeria were the two legions for what?</h3><p>army of Germania Inferior</p><p>army of Germania Inferior</p><p>army of Germania Inferior</p><h3>What was the Colonia Agrippina's original name?</h3><p>Ubiorum</p><p>oppidum Ubiorum</p><p>oppidum Ubiorum</p><h3>What did the number of legions in Roman times depend on?</h3><p>threat of war</p><p>whether a state or threat of war existed</p><p>whether a state or threat of war existed</p><h3>What does Colonia Agrippina's original name translate into?</h3><p>town of the Ubii</p><p>town of the Ubii</p><p>town of the Ubii</p><h2>Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine, Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine. This &quot;Germanic Heroic Age&quot; is reflected in medieval legend, such as the Nibelungenlied which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels (Siebengebirge) (&quot;dragons rock&quot;), near Bonn at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms, at the Rhine and Kriemhild's golden treasure, which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen.</h2><h3>When did Germanic tribes cross the Rhine to migrate?</h3><p>5th century</p><p>Migration period</p><p>5th century</p><h3>What did Germanic tribes establish with help from the Rhine?</h3><p>kingdoms</p><p>kingdoms</p><p>kingdoms</p><h3>What is the translation of Siebengebirge?</h3><p>dragons rock</p><p>dragons rock</p><p>dragons rock</p><h3>Who is the hero who killed a dragon on the Drachenfels?</h3><p>Siegfried</p><p>Siegfried</p><p>Siegfried</p><h3>Who threw gold into the Rhine, according to legend?</h3><p>Hagen</p><p>Hagen</p><p>Hagen</p><h2>By the 6th century, the Rhine was within the borders of Francia. In the 9th, it formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia, but in the 10th century, it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire, flowing through Swabia, Franconia and Lower Lorraine. The mouths of the Rhine, in the county of Holland, fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states. The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years' War. The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route.</h2><h3>When did the Rhine become borders with Francia?</h3><p>6th century</p><p>6th century</p><h3>When was the Rhine fully within the Holy Roman Empire?</h3><p>10th century</p><p>10th century</p><p>10th century</p><h3>The Rhine flowed through Swabia, Franconia and what other location in the 10th Century?</h3><p>Lower Lorraine</p><p>Lower Lorraine</p><p>Lower Lorraine</p><h3>Who sold the Upper Rhine to Burgundy?</h3><p>Archduke Sigismund</p><p>Archduke Sigismund of Austria</p><p>Archduke Sigismund of Austria</p><h3>When was the Upper Rhine sold to Burgundy?</h3><p>1469</p><p>1469</p><p>1469</p><h2>Since the Peace of Westphalia, the Upper Rhine formed a contentious border between France and Germany. Establishing &quot;natural borders&quot; on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy, since the Middle Ages, though the language border was – and is – far more to the west. French leaders, such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine. The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon, as a French client state, in 1806 and lasted until 1814, during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the First French Empire. In 1840, the Rhine crisis, prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers's desire to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border, led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in Germany.</h2><h3>What was the name of the time the Upper Rhine form a border between France and Germany?</h3><p>Peace of Westphalia</p><p>Peace of Westphalia</p><p>Peace of Westphalia</p><h3>What was a long term goal of French foreign policy along the Rhine?</h3><p>Establishing &quot;natural borders&quot;</p><p>Establishing &quot;natural borders&quot;</p><p>Establishing &quot;natural borders&quot; on the Rhine</p><h3>Who established the Confederation of the Rhine?</h3><p>Napoleon</p><p>Napoleon</p><p>Napoleon</p><h3>When was the confederation of the Rhine?</h3><p>1806</p><p>1806</p><p>1806</p><h3>When was the Rhine crisis?</h3><p>1840</p><p>1840</p><p>1840</p><h2>At the end of World War I, the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles. This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies, until 1935 and after that, it would be a demilitarised zone, with the German army forbidden to enter. The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as helping Adolf Hitler's rise to power. The allies left the Rhineland, in 1930 and the German army re-occupied it in 1936, which was enormously popular in Germany. Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler.</h2><h3>When was Rhineland subject to the Treaty of Versailles?</h3><p>end of World War I</p><p>end of World War I</p><p>end of World War I</p><h3>When would the occupation of allies leave Rhineland?</h3><p>1935</p><p>1930</p><p>1935</p><h3>After 1935, who would be forbidden to enter Rhineland?</h3><p>German army</p><p>German army</p><p>German army</p><h3>What do some believe the Treaty of Versailles assisted in?</h3><p>Adolf Hitler's rise to power</p><p>helping Adolf Hitler's rise to power</p><p>Adolf Hitler's rise to power</p><h3>When did the German army reoccupy Rhineland?</h3><p>1936</p><p>1936</p><p>1936</p><h2>In World War II, it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies. The Rhine bridge at Arnhem, immortalized in the book, A Bridge Too Far and the film, was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem, during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944. The bridges at Nijmegen, over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden. In a separate operation, the Ludendorff Bridge, crossing the Rhine at Remagen, became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact – much to their own surprise – after the Germans failed to demolish it. This also became the subject of a film, The Bridge at Remagen. Seven Days to the River Rhine was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War.</h2><h3>Where is the Rhine Bridge?</h3><p>Arnhem</p><p>Arnhem</p><p>Arnhem</p><h3>What was the Rhine considered to invaders in WWII?</h3><p>formidable natural obstacle</p><p>formidable natural obstacle</p><p>natural obstacle</p><h3>When was Operation Market Garden?</h3><p>September 1944</p><p>September 1944</p><p>September 1944</p><h3>What bridge did the Germans fail to demolish?</h3><p>Ludendorff Bridge</p><p>Ludendorff Bridge</p><p>Ludendorff Bridge</p><h3>What was the Warsaw Pact war plan?</h3><p>Seven Days to the River Rhine</p><p>plan for an invasion of Western Europe</p><p>plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War</p><h2>Until 1932 the generally accepted length of the Rhine was 1,230 kilometres (764 miles).

After this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications.
