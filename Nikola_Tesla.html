He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant. His work in the formative years of electric power development was involved in a corporate alternating current/direct current &quot;War of Currents&quot; as well as various patent battles.</h2><h3>In what year did Nikola Tesla emigrate to the United States?</h3><p>1884</p><p>1884</p><p>1884</p><h3>Who did Tesla work for in the 1880s?</h3><p>Thomas Edison</p><p>Thomas Edison</p><p>Thomas Edison</p><h3>Tesla's induction motor and transformer was licensed by whom?</h3><p>George Westinghouse</p><p>George Westinghouse</p><p>George Westinghouse</p><h3>In what area of the United States did Tesla move to?</h3><p>New York City</p><p>New York City</p><p>New York City</p><h3>What &quot;war&quot; was Tesla involved in?</h3><p>War of Currents</p><p>War of Currents</p><p>War of Currents</p><h3>When did Tesla come to the US?</h3><p>1884</p><p>1884</p><p>1884</p><h3>What other inventor did he work with?</h3><p>Thomas Edison</p><p>Thomas Edison</p><p>Thomas Edison</p><h3>Where did Tesla work with Edison?</h3><p>New York City</p><p>New York City</p><p>New York City</p><h3>Who licensed Tesla's induction motor?</h3><p>George Westinghouse</p><p>George Westinghouse</p><p>George Westinghouse</p><h3>What other invention of Tesla's did Westinghouse license?</h3><p>transformer</p><p>transformer</p><p>transformer</p><h2>Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs, and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. He tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project. In his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.</h2><h3>When did Tesla discover the possibility of wireless connectivity?</h3><p>1893</p><p>1893</p><p>1893</p><h3>Were Tesla's experiments high-voltage or low-voltage?</h3><p>high-voltage</p><p>high-voltage</p><p>high-voltage</p><h3>What were some of Tesla's experiments?</h3><p>mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging</p><p>power experiments</p><p>high-voltage, high-frequency power</p><h3>Other than New York where did Tesla conduct experiments?</h3><p>Colorado Springs</p><p>Colorado Springs</p><p>Colorado Springs</p><h3>When did he first mention wireless communication?</h3><p>1893</p><p>1893</p><p>1893</p><h3>What remote control vehicle did he make?</h3><p>boat</p><p>boat</p><p>boat</p><h3>Where was his unfinished project called?</h3><p>Wardenclyffe Tower project</p><p>Wardenclyffe Tower</p><p>Wardenclyffe Tower</p><h2>Tesla was renowned for his achievements and showmanship, eventually earning him a reputation in popular culture as an archetypal &quot;mad scientist&quot;. His patents earned him a considerable amount of money, much of which was used to finance his own projects with varying degrees of success.:121,154 He lived most of his life in a series of New York hotels, through his retirement. Tesla died on 7 January 1943. His work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but in 1960 the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.</h2><h3>What year did Tesla die? </h3><p>1943</p><p>1943</p><p>1943</p><h3>What was named &quot;The Tesla&quot; in his honor?</h3><p>SI unit of magnetic flux density</p><p>the SI unit of magnetic flux density</p><p>SI unit of magnetic flux density</p><h3>Where did Tesla live for much of his life?</h3><p>New York hotels</p><p>New York hotels</p><p>New York hotels</p><h3>What was Tesla's reputation in popular culture?</h3><p>mad scientist</p><p>mad scientist</p><p>mad scientist</p><h3>How did Tesla finance his work?</h3><p>patents</p><p>His patents</p><p>His patents</p><h3>What year did Tesla die?</h3><p>1943</p><p>1943</p><p>1943</p><h3>What did the General Conference on Weights and Measures name after Tesla in 1960?</h3><p>SI unit of magnetic flux density</p><p>the SI unit of magnetic flux density</p><p>SI unit of magnetic flux density</p><h3>When did people once again start to show an interest in Tesla?</h3><p>1990s</p><p>the 1990s</p><p>1990s</p><h3>Other than his scientific achievements what was Tesla famous for?</h3><p>showmanship</p><p>showmanship</p><p>showmanship</p><h2>Tesla was born on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 into a Serb family in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest. Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (née Mandić), whose father was also an Orthodox priest,:10 had a talent for making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Nikola credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence. Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.:12</h2><h3>What modern-day country was Tesla born in?</h3><p>Croatia</p><p>Croatia</p><p>Croatia</p><h3>What was the occupation of Tesla's father?</h3><p>priest</p><p>priest</p><p>Serbian Orthodox priest</p><h3>What was special about Tesla's memory?</h3><p>eidetic</p><p>eidetic</p><p>eidetic</p><h3>Who did Tesla credit for his abilities?</h3><p>his mother's genetics</p><p>his mother</p><p>his mother</p><h3>What was Tesla's fathers occupation?</h3><p>priest</p><p>priest</p><p>Serbian Orthodox priest</p><h3>What was Tesla's father's name?</h3><p>Milutin Tesla</p><p>Milutin Tesla</p><p>Milutin Tesla</p><h3>What was Tesla's mother's name?</h3><p>Đuka Tesla</p><p>Đuka Tesla</p><p>Đuka Tesla (née Mandić)</p><h3>What were Tesla's mother's special abilities?</h3><p>making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems</p><p>making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems</p><p>making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems</p><h3>Where did Tesla believe his talents came from?</h3><p>his mother's genetics and influence</p><p>his mother</p><p>his mother's genetics and influence</p><h2>Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had an older brother named Dane and three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica. Dane was killed in a horse-riding accident when Nikola was five. In 1861, Tesla attended the &quot;Lower&quot; or &quot;Primary&quot; School in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to Gospić, Austrian Empire, where Tesla's father worked as a pastor. Nikola completed &quot;Lower&quot; or &quot;Primary&quot; School, followed by the &quot;Lower Real Gymnasium&quot; or &quot;Normal School.&quot;</h2><h3>How many siblings did Tesla have?</h3><p>four</p><p>four</p><p>four</p><h3>What language did Tesla study while in school?</h3><p>German</p><p>German</p><p>German</p><h3>In what year did Tesla's family move to Gospic?</h3><p>1862</p><p>1862</p><p>1862</p><h3>What was Tesla's brother's name?</h3><p>Dane</p><p>Dane</p><p>Dane</p><h3>What were Tesla's sisters' names?</h3><p>Milka, Angelina and Marica</p><p>Milka, Angelina and Marica</p><p>Milka, Angelina and Marica</p><h3>What happened to Dane?</h3><p>killed in a horse-riding accident</p><p>killed in a horse-riding accident</p><p>killed in a horse-riding accident</p><h3>Where did the family move in 1862?</h3><p>Gospić, Austrian Empire</p><p>Gospić</p><p>Gospić</p><h3>What job did Tesla's father have in Gospic?</h3><p>pastor</p><p>a pastor</p><p>pastor</p><h2>In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac, to attend school at the Higher Real Gymnasium, where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher Martin Sekulić.:32 The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier. Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.:33</h2><h3>Who was Tesla influenced by while in school?</h3><p>Martin Sekulić</p><p>Martin Sekulić</p><p>math teacher Martin Sekulić</p><h3>What language were classes held in at Tesla's school?</h3><p>German</p><p>German</p><p>German</p><h3>What could Tesla perform in his head?</h3><p>integral calculus</p><p>integral calculus</p><p>integral calculus</p><h3>What did Tesla's teachers believe he was doing while in school?</h3><p>cheating</p><p>cheating</p><p>cheating</p><h3>In what year did Tesla graduate from the Higher Real Gymnasium?</h3><p>1873</p><p>1873</p><p>1873</p><h3>When did Tesla go to Karlovac?</h3><p>1870</p><p>In 1870</p><p>1870</p><h3>Why did Tesla go to Karlovac?</h3><p>to attend school</p><p>to attend school</p><p>attend school at the Higher Real Gymnasium</p><h3>Who was Tesla's main influence in Karlovac?</h3><p>Martin Sekulić</p><p>Martin Sekulić</p><p>math teacher Martin Sekulić</p><h3>In what language were the classes given?</h3><p>German</p><p>German</p><p>German</p><h3>When did Tesla graduate?</h3><p>1873</p><p>1873</p><p>1873</p><h2>In 1873, Tesla returned to his birthtown, Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, Tesla contracted cholera; he was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness (his father had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood).</h2><h3>What disease did Tesla contract in 1873?</h3><p>cholera</p><p>cholera</p><p>cholera</p><h3>How long was he bedridden with cholera?</h3><p>nine months</p><p>nine months</p><p>nine months</p><h3>What did Tesla's father promise him while he were bedridden?</h3><p>the best engineering school</p><p>to send him to the best engineering school</p><p>send him to the best engineering school if he recovered</p><h3>What did Tesla's father originally want him to do?</h3><p>enter the priesthood</p><p>enter the priesthood</p><p>enter the priesthood</p><h3>Where did Tesla return to in 1873?</h3><p>Smiljan</p><p>Smiljan</p><p>his birthtown, Smiljan</p><h3>What was the year when Tesla went back to Smiljan?</h3><p>1873</p><p>1873</p><p>1873</p><h3>What disease did Tesla catch?</h3><p>cholera</p><p>cholera</p><p>cholera</p><h3>How long was he in bed from cholera?</h3><p>nine months</p><p>nine months</p><p>nine months</p><h3>What was Tesla's father's original plans for Tesla?</h3><p>enter the priesthood</p><p>the priesthood</p><p>enter the priesthood</p><h3>What bargain did his father make with him if Tesla recovered?</h3><p>to send him to the best engineering school</p><p>to send him to the best engineering school</p><p>promised to send him to the best engineering school</p><h2>In 1874, Tesla evaded being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There, he explored the mountains in hunter's garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj, and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.</h2><h3>Where did Tesla run to avoid the army draft?</h3><p>Tomingaj</p><p>Tomingaj</p><p>Tomingaj</p><h3>Whose works helped Tesla recover from illness?</h3><p>Mark Twain</p><p>Mark Twain's</p><p>Mark Twain's</p><h3>What did Tesla explore in Tominaj?</h3><p>the mountains</p><p>the mountains</p><p>mountains</p><h3>What year did Tesla avade the draft? </h3><p>1874</p><p>1874</p><p>1874</p><h3>What did Tesla dress in while in Tominaj?</h3><p>hunter's garb</p><p>hunter's garb</p><p>hunter's garb</p><h3>Why did Tesla avoid by fleeing Smiljan?</h3><p>being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army</p><p>being drafted</p><p>being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army</p><h3>When did Tesla go to Tomingaj?</h3><p>1874</p><p>In 1874</p><p>1874</p><h3>What did Tesla do in Tomingaj?</h3><p>he explored the mountains in hunter's garb</p><p>he explored</p><p>explored the mountains in hunter's garb</p><h3>What author did Tesla credit for his recovery?</h3><p>Mark Twain</p><p>Mark Twain</p><p>Mark Twain</p><h2>In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship. During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, &quot;Your son is a star of first rank.&quot; Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was &quot;mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.&quot; After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he &quot;conquered [his] passion then and there,&quot; but later he was known to play billiards in the US. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester.</h2><h3>What year did Tesla enroll at an engineering school?</h3><p>1875</p><p>1875</p><p>1875</p><h3>What school did he enroll in during 1875?</h3><p>Austrian Polytechnic</p><p>Austrian Polytechnic</p><p>Austrian Polytechnic</p><h3>In what year did Tesla's father die?</h3><p>1879</p><p>1879</p><p>1879</p><h3>What did Tesla struggle with while in school? </h3><p>gambling</p><p>gambling</p><p>gambling</p><h3>Did Tesla graduate from the university?</h3><p>no</p><p>not</p><p>He never graduated</p><h3>Where was Austrian Polytechnic located?</h3><p>Graz, Austria</p><p>in Graz, Austria</p><p>Graz, Austria</p><h3>When did Tesla enroll in Austrian Polytechnic?</h3><p>1875</p><p>In 1875</p><p>1875</p><h3>When did Tesla's father die?</h3><p>1879</p><p>in 1879</p><p>1879</p><h3>How did Tesla lose his tuition money?</h3><p>gambled</p><p>gambling</p><p>gambling</p><h3>What was Tesla's father afraid would happen to him in school?</h3><p>Tesla would be killed through overwork</p><p>killed through overwork</p><p>would be killed through overwork</p><h2>In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of school. His friends thought that he had drowned in the Mur River. Tesla went to Maribor (now in Slovenia), where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets. In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused. Nikola suffered a nervous breakdown at around the same time.</h2><h3>What did Tesla do in December 1878?</h3><p>left Graz</p><p>left Graz</p><p>left Graz and severed all relations with his family</p><h3>Why did Tesla sever ties with his family?</h3><p>to hide the fact that he dropped out of school</p><p>hide the fact that he dropped out of school</p><p>to hide the fact that he dropped out of school</p><h3>What did Tesla work as after dropping out? </h3><p>a draftsman</p><p>a draftsman</p><p>as a draftsman</p><h3>Before he died, what did Tesla's father ask him to do?</h3><p>return home</p><p>return home</p><p>return home</p><h3>What health issue did Tesla suffer?</h3><p>nervous breakdown</p><p>nervous breakdown</p><p>nervous breakdown</p><h3>When did Tesla depart Graz?</h3><p>1878</p><p>December 1878</p><p>to hide the fact that he dropped out of school</p><h3>What secret did he sever family ties to keep hidden?</h3><p>that he dropped out of school</p><p>the fact that he dropped out of school</p><p>he dropped out of school</p><h3>What was Tesla's friends' theory as to what became of him?</h3><p>His friends thought that he had drowned in the Mur River.</p><p>drowned in the Mur River</p><p>drowned in the Mur River</p><h3>What did Tesla do in Maribor for work?</h3><p>draftsman</p><p>he worked as a draftsman</p><p>draftsman</p><h3>What health problem did Tesla have in 1879?</h3><p>nervous breakdown</p><p>a nervous breakdown</p><p>nervous breakdown</p><h2>On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit. On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness (although some sources say that he died of a stroke).

The motor used polyphase current which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.</h2><h3>What did Tesla develop in 1887?</h3><p>an induction motor</p><p>an induction motor</p><p>induction motor that ran on alternating current</p><h3>When was Tesla's innovative motor patented? </h3><p>May 1888</p><p>in May 1888</p><p>May 1888</p><h3>What did Tesla's design not need? </h3><p>a commutator</p><p>commutator</p><p>a commutator</p><h3>What did his design avoid in not having a commutator?</h3><p>sparking</p><p>sparking and the high maintenance</p><p>sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes</p><h3>what sort of design was this motor?</h3><p>self-starting</p><p>self-starting</p><p>induction</p><h3>When did Tesla make the induction motor?</h3><p>1887</p><p>1887</p><p>1887</p><h3>Why was AC electricity gaining popularity?</h3><p>because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission</p><p>advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission</p><p>because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission</p><h3>What high maintenance part did Tesla's AC motor not require?</h3><p>mechanical brushes</p><p>a commutator</p><p>mechanical brushes</p><h3>When did Tesla patent the motor?</h3><p>1888</p><p>in May 1888</p><p>1888</p><h2>In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE).

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.</h2><h3>Who was the War of Currents waged between? </h3><p>Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse</p><p>Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse</p><p>Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse</p><h3>What did the war first start out as being between?</h3><p>lighting systems</p><p>electrical distribution</p><p>a competition between rival lighting systems</p><h3>What did Edison Machine Works persue in 1890?</h3><p>AC development</p><p>AC development</p><p>AC development</p><h3>What company took over Edison Machine Works?</h3><p>General Electric</p><p>General Electric</p><p>General Electric</p><h3>Which current type was Tesla in favor of?</h3><p>AC</p><p>AC</p><p>AC</p><h3>Who was Westinghouse's chief rival?</h3><p>Thomas Edison</p><p>Thomas Edison</p><p>Thomas Edison</p><h3>When did the rivalry between Westinghouse and Edison reach its peak?</h3><p>1888</p><p>1888</p><p>1888</p><h3>What caused the delay during the development of the AC motor.</h3><p>financial strain</p><p>financial strain</p><p>the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build</p><h3>Who took control of Edison's company.</h3><p>General Electric</p><p>General Electric</p><p>General Electric</p><h2>In 1893, George Westinghouse won the bid to light the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current, beating out a General Electric bid by one million dollars.

Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. Based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration that they could build a complete AC system at the Columbian Exposition, a contract for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls was awarded to Westinghouse Electric.

Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to &quot;deal with the bankers&quot; to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.</h2><h3>When was a patent-sharing agreement signed between Westinghouse Electric and General Electric?</h3><p>1896</p><p>1896</p><p>1896</p><h3>How much did Tesla sell his AC patents to Westinghouse Electric for?</h3><p>$216,000</p><p>$216,000</p><p>a lump sum payment of $216,000</p><h3>What was the overly generous royalty amount that Tesla had been receiving? </h3><p>$2.50 per AC horsepower royalty</p><p>$2.50 per AC horsepower</p><p>$2.50 per AC horsepower</p><h3>By 1897, how much had Tesla, Brown, and Peck received in royalties and licenses over the patents?</h3><p>$200,000</p><p>estimated $200,000</p><p>an estimated $200,000</p><h3>Who financed General Electric's attempts to takeover Westinghouse?</h3><p>J.

Tesla tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs. Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate &quot;Teleautomatics&quot; in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.</h2><h3>When did Tesla give a demonstration of his remote control boat?</h3><p>1898</p><p>In 1898,</p><p>1898</p><h3>What was the boat called?</h3><p>teleautomaton</p><p>teleautomaton</p><p>teleautomaton</p><h3>Where was the boat demonstration given?</h3><p>Madison Square Garden</p><p>Madison Square Garden</p><p>Madison Square Garden</p><h3>What was the occasion for the boat demonstration?</h3><p>an electrical exhibition</p><p>an electrical exhibition</p><p>an electrical exhibition</p><h3>What type of animal did onlookers claim was piloting the boat?</h3><p>monkey</p><p>monkey</p><p>a trained monkey</p><h2>In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a &quot;system of transmitting electrical energy&quot; and &quot;an electrical transmitter.&quot; When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).</h2><h3>When did Tesla attain his electrical transmitter patent?</h3><p>1900</p><p>1900</p><p>1900</p><h3>Who first sent radio waves across the Atlantic?</h3><p>Marconi</p><p>Guglielmo Marconi</p><p>Guglielmo Marconi</p><h3>When was Marconi's radio demonstration?</h3><p>1901</p><p>1901</p><p>1901</p><h3>When were Tesla's patents restored?</h3><p>1943</p><p>1943</p><p>1943</p><h3>A decision made by what entity restored Tesla's patents?</h3><p>Supreme Court of the United States</p><p>Supreme Court of the United States</p><p>Supreme Court of the United States</p><h2>On 17 May 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments; his lab was located near Foote Ave. and Kiowa St. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he was conducting wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.[citation needed] The 1978 book Colorado Springs Notes, 1899–1900 contains descriptions of Tesla's experiments. On 15 June 1899, Tesla performed his first experiments at his Colorado Springs lab; he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long, but very thick and noisy.</h2><h3>In what year did Tesla go to Colorado Springs?</h3><p>1899</p><p>1899</p><p>1899</p><h3> Where did he claim he would transport energy to?</h3><p>Paris</p><p>Paris</p><p>Pikes Peak to Paris</p><h3>What date did Tesla begin his Colorado Springs experiments?</h3><p>15 June 1899</p><p>15 June 1899</p><p>15 June 1899</p><h3>What was the recorded length of the first spark?</h3><p>five inches</p><p>five inches</p><p>five inches</p><h2>Tesla investigated atmospheric electricity, observing lightning signals via his receivers.

Thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in Cripple Creek, Colorado. People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes.

He mentioned them in a letter to reporter Julian Hawthorne at the Philadelphia North American on 8 December 1899 and in a December 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the Red Cross Society where he referred to messages &quot;from another world&quot; that read &quot;1... 2... 3...&quot;. Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article &quot;Talking With Planets&quot; where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing &quot;intelligently controlled signals&quot; and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.</h2><h3>To what did Tesla attribute the unknown signals his radio received?</h3><p>communications from another planet</p><p>communications from another planet</p><p>communications from another planet</p><h3>What planet did the reporters decide the signals were from?</h3><p>Mars</p><p>Mars</p><p>Mars</p><h3>What magazine did Tesla talk to about the strange signals?</h3><p>Collier's Weekly</p><p>Collier's Weekly</p><p>Collier's Weekly</p><h3>What is another possible explanation for the source of the signals?</h3><p>intercepted Marconi's European experiments</p><p>he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments</p><p>he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899</p><h3>When did Marconi transmit similar signals to those Tesla received?</h3><p>July 1899</p><p>July 1899</p><p>July 1899</p><h2>In 1899, John Jacob Astor IV invested $100,000 for Tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system.

Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds. Tesla wrote another plea to Morgan, but it was also fruitless.

Tesla continued the project for another nine months. The tower was erected to its full 187 feet (57 m). In July 1903, Tesla wrote to Morgan that in addition to wireless communication, Wardenclyffe would be capable of wireless transmission of electric power. On 14 October 1904, Morgan finally replied through his secretary, stating, &quot;It will be impossible for [me] to do anything in the matter,&quot; after Tesla had written to Morgan when the financier was meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury in an attempt to appeal to his Christian spirit.</h2><h3>How much correspondence did Tesla send Morgan in the five years following 1901?</h3><p>over 50 letters</p><p>over 50 letters</p><p>50 letters</p><h3>Why did Tesla want funds from Morgan?</h3><p>to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe.</p><p>to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe</p><p>to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe</p><h3>What happened in 1901?</h3><p>Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland</p><p>Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland</p><p>Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland</p><h3>How tall was the tower's ultimate height?</h3><p>187 feet</p><p>187 feet</p><p>187 feet (57 m)</p><h2>On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated his 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.

The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'&quot; The plan was, at least provisionally approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H.

Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water but Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating &quot;(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly.&quot;:266</h2><h3>In what magazine did Tesla talk about reflecting electricity off of submarine's hulls?</h3><p>Electrical Experimenter</p><p>Electrical Experimenter</p><p>Electrical Experimenter</p><h3>How would the operator of observe the reflected signal?</h3><p>fluorescent screen</p><p>fluorescent screen</p><p>with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen</p><h3>What later invention was Tesla's idea similar to?</h3><p>radar</p><p>radar</p><p>modern radar</p><h3>Who played a part in the development of radar in France?</h3><p>Émile Girardeau</p><p>Émile Girardeau</p><p>Émile Girardeau,</p><h2>On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg &quot;for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays.&quot;:245 There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize.:245 The Nobel Foundation said, &quot;Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous&quot;; a recipient could only decline a Nobel Prize after he is announced a winner.:245</h2><h3>Who did Reuters claim won the 1915 Nobel prize in Physics?</h3><p>Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla</p><p>Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla</p><p>Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla</p><h3>Who actually won the prize?</h3><p>Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg</p><p>Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg</p><p>Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg</p><h3>What was the rumored reason Edison and Tesla were not awarded the prize?</h3><p>Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize</p><p>Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize</p><p>Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize</p><h3>According to the Nobel Foundation what has to happen before someone can decline a prize?</h3><p>announced a winner</p><p>he is announced a winner</p><p>after he is announced a winner</p><h2>There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.:245</h2><h3>What was another possible reason that Tesla and Edison did not get the award?.</h3><p>animosity toward each other</p><p>their animosity toward each other</p><p>because of their animosity toward each other</p><h2>In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1937).</h2><h3>How many possible bids for the prize were there in 1915?</h3><p>38</p><p>38</p><p>38</p><h3>Who received a bid in 1915?</h3><p>Edison</p><p>Edison</p><p>Edison</p><h3>In what year did Tesla receive a Nobel Prize bid?</h3><p>1937</p><p>1937</p><p>1937</p><h2>In 1928, Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then be &quot;gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices&quot; in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.

While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground. Tesla's back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident (the full extent of his injuries will never be known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor—an almost lifelong custom). Tesla didn't raise any question as to who was at fault and refused medical aid, only asking to be taken to his hotel via cab. Tesla was bedridden for some months and was unable to continue feeding pigeons from his window; soon, they failed to come. In early 1938, Tesla was able to get up. He at once resumed the pigeon-feeding walks on a much more limited scale, but frequently had a messenger act for him.</h2><h3>What was Tesla on his way to do when he was struck by the cab?</h3><p>feed the pigeons</p><p>feed the pigeons</p><p>feed the pigeons</p><h3>Who did Tesla refuse to see following the accident?</h3><p>a doctor</p><p>a doctor</p><p>a doctor</p><h3>What happened to his ribs in the accident?</h3><p>broken</p><p>broken</p><p>broken</p><h3>When did he first get out of bed following the accident?</h3><p>early 1938</p><p>In early 1938</p><p>early 1938</p><h3>When did the accident occur?</h3><p>the fall of 1937</p><p>In the fall of 1937</p><p>fall of 1937</p><h2>Later in life, Tesla made claims concerning a &quot;teleforce&quot; weapon after studying the Van de Graaff generator.

It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion).

Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.</h2><h3>What famous writer was Tesla's good friend?</h3><p>Mark Twain</p><p>Mark Twain</p><p>Mark Twain</p><h3>Where did Tesla and Twain hang out?</h3><p>lab</p><p>in his lab</p><p>in his lab and elsewhere</p><h3>When did Tesla become friends with Viereck?</h3><p>late 1920s</p><p>the late 1920s</p><p>the late 1920s</p><h2>Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.:110 He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.:33</h2><h3>Who was Tesla prejudiced against?</h3><p>overweight people</p><p>overweight people</p><p>overweight people</p><h3>Who did he fire?</h3><p>secretary</p><p>a secretary</p><p>a secretary</p><h3>Why did he fire the secretary?</h3><p>her weight</p><p>her weight</p><p>her weight.</p><h3>What did he make the employee do when he didn't like her outfit?</h3><p>go home and change</p><p>go home and change</p><p>to go home and change her dress</p><h2>Tesla exhibited a pre-atomic understanding of physics in his writings; he disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge (he believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or &quot;sub-atom&quot; that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity).:249 Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way.

His opinion stemmed from the belief that humans' &quot;pity&quot; had interfered with the natural &quot;ruthless workings of nature,&quot; rather than from conceptions of a &quot;master race&quot; or inherent superiority of one person over another. His advocacy of it was, however, to push it further. In a 1937 interview, he stated:</h2><h3>What idea was Tesla a fan of?</h3><p>eugenics</p><p>eugenics</p><p>imposed selective breeding version of eugenics</p><h3>What was his belief as to what nature was supposed to be?</h3><p>ruthless</p><p>ruthless</p><p>ruthless workings</p><h3>What attribute of humans interfered with nature's ruthlessness in Tesla's opinion?</h3><p>pity</p><p>pity</p><p>pity</p><h3>When did he talk about his beliefs in an interview?</h3><p>1937</p><p>1937</p><p>1937</p><h2>In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by &quot;Queen Bees.&quot; He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.</h2><h3>Who did Tesla think would run the world of the future?</h3><p>women</p><p>women</p><p>women</p><h3>When did he talk about his thoughts on gender?</h3><p>1926</p><p>1926</p><p>1926</p><h3>What term did he use for what he believed would be humanity's future rulers?</h3><p>Queen Bees</p><p>Queen Bees</p><p>Queen Bees</p><h2>Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, &quot;Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War&quot; (20 December 1914).
