<html><body><div><h1>Kenya</h1><h2>Kenya (/ˈkɛnjə/; locally [ˈkɛɲa] ( listen)), officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers 581,309 km2 (224,445 sq mi), and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014.</h2><h3>Where is Kenya located?</h3><p>in Africa</p><p>Africa</p><h3>What is Kenya a founding member of?</h3><p>East African Community</p><p>East African Community</p><p>East African Community</p><h3>What is the capitol of Kenya?</h3><p>Nairobi</p><p>Nairobi</p><p>Nairobi</p><h3>What country boarders the south of Kenya?</h3><p>Tanzania</p><p>Tanzania</p><p>Tanzania</p><h3>What was the population of Kenya in 2014?</h3><p>45 million people</p><p>45 million people</p><p>approximately 45 million</p><h2>Kenya has a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline. The climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city, Nairobi, and especially closer to Mount Kenya, which has snow permanently on its peaks. Further inland, in the Nyanza region, there is a hot and dry climate which becomes humid around Lake Victoria, the largest tropical fresh-water lake in the world. This gives way to temperate and forested hilly areas in the neighboring western region. The north-eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes. Kenya is known for its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such as the East and West Tsavo National Park, the Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Aberdares National Park. Kenya has several world heritage sites such as Lamu and numerous beaches, including in Diani, Bamburi and Kilifi, where international yachting competitions are held every year.</h2><h3>What type of climate does Kenya have?</h3><p>a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline</p><p>warm and humid tropical climate</p><p>tropical</p><h3>How is the climate near the savannah grasslands?</h3><p>The climate is cooler</p><p>cooler</p><p>cooler</p><h3>What mountain has snow on it all year round?</h3><p>Mount Kenya</p><p>Mount Kenya,</p><p>Mount Kenya</p><h3>What regions do the north-eastern part of the country boarder?</h3><p>Somalia and Ethiopia</p><p>Somalia and Ethiopia</p><p>Somalia and Ethiopia</p><h3>What is Kenya known for?</h3><p>its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks</p><p>safaris, diverse climate and geography</p><p>safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves</p><h2>The African Great Lakes region, which Kenya is a part of, has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period. By the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa. The borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa. Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents. European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century. The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony. Kenya obtained independence in December 1963. Following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution, Kenya is now divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties, governed by elected governors.</h2><h3>How long has the African Great Lakes region been inhabited?</h3><p>Lower Paleolithic period</p><p>since the Lower Paleolithic period</p><p>since the Lower Paleolithic period</p><h3>When did the Bantu expansion reach the area from West-Central Africa?</h3><p>By the first millennium AD</p><p>By the first millennium AD</p><p>first millennium AD</p><h3>Where is 97% of the population located?</h3><p>Bantu and Nilotic</p><p>Bantu and Nilotic</p><p>Bantu and Nilotic</p><h3>When did the exploration of the interior begin?</h3><p>19th century</p><p>19th century</p><p>19th century</p><h3>When did Kenya obtain independence?</h3><p>December 1963</p><p>December 1963</p><p>December 1963</p><h2>The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya. The origin of the name Kenya is not clear, but perhaps linked to the Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba words Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa and Kiinyaa which mean &quot;God's resting place&quot; in all three languages. If so, then the British may not so much have mispronounced it ('Keenya'), as misspelled it. Prehistoric volcanic eruptions of Mount Kenya (now extinct) may have resulted in its association with divinity and creation among the indigenous Bantu ethnic groups, who are the native inhabitants of the agricultural land surrounding Mount Kenya.[original research?]</h2><h3>What is the Republic of Kenya named after?</h3><p>Mount Kenya</p><p>Mount Kenya</p><p>Mount Kenya</p><h3>What words to they think are linked to the work Kenya?</h3><p>Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa and Kiinyaa</p><p>Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba</p><p>Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba</p><h3>What do the words Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa, and Kiinyaa mean?</h3><p>God's resting place</p><p>God's resting place</p><p>God's resting place</p><h2>Ludwig Krapf recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia believed by most to be a corruption of the Kamba version. Others say that this was—on the contrary—a very precise notation of a correct African pronunciation /ˈkɛnjə/. An 1882 map drawn by Joseph Thompsons, a Scottish geologist and naturalist, indicated Mt. Kenya as Mt. Kenia, 1862. Controversy over the actual meaning of the word Kenya notwithstanding, it is clear that the mountain's name became widely accepted, pars pro toto, as the name of the country.</h2><h3>Ludwig Krapf recorded the name was what?</h3><p>both Kenia and Kegnia</p><p>Kenia and Kegnia</p><p>Kenia and Kegnia</p><h3>What do some believe about this pronunciation?</h3><p>a very precise notation of a correct African pronunciation</p><p>precise</p><p>precise</p><h3>Who was the Scottish geologist that named Mt Kenya as Mt Kenia?</h3><p>Joseph Thompsons</p><p>Joseph Thompsons</p><p>Joseph Thompsons</p><h3>What year did Thompsons indicate Mt Kenya?</h3><p>1862</p><p>1862</p><p>1862</p><h2>The &quot;Big Five&quot; game animals of Africa, that is the lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant, can be found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular. A significant population of other wild animals, reptiles and birds can be found in the national parks and game reserves in the country. The annual animal migration occurs between June and September with millions of animals taking part, attracting valuable foreign tourism. Two million wildebeest migrate a distance of 2,900 kilometres (1,802 mi) from the Serengeti in neighbouring Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya, in a constant clockwise fashion, searching for food and water supplies. This Serengeti Migration of the wildebeest is a curious spectacle listed among the 10 Natural Wonders of Africa.</h2><h3>What are the biggest game animals of Kenya called?</h3><p>The &quot;Big Five&quot;</p><p>Big Five</p><p>Big Five</p><h3>What are the &quot;Big Five&quot; animals in Kenya?</h3><p>lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant</p><p>lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant</p><p>lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant</p><h3>Where are these animals mostly located?</h3><p>Masai Mara</p><p>national parks</p><p>Masai Mara</p><h3>When does the annual animal migration occur?</h3><p>between June and September</p><p>June and September</p><p>between June and September</p><h3>How far do the wildebeest migrate searching for food and water?</h3><p>2,900 kilometres (1,802 mi)</p><p>2,900 kilometres</p><p>2,900 kilometres</p><h2>Fossils found in Kenya suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago. Recent findings near Lake Turkana indicate that hominids such as Homo habilis (1.8 and 2.5 million years ago) and Homo erectus (1.8 million to 350,000 years ago) are possible direct ancestors of modern Homo sapiens, and lived in Kenya in the Pleistocene epoch. During excavations at Lake Turkana in 1984, paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey assisted by Kamoya Kimeu discovered the Turkana Boy, a 1.6-million-year-old fossil belonging to Homo erectus. Previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey, who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at Olorgesailie and Hyrax Hill. Later work at the former site was undertaken by Glynn Isaac.</h2><h3>How long ago did primates inhabit Kenya?</h3><p>more than 20 million years ago</p><p>20 million years ago</p><p>20 million years ago</p><h3>When did the ancestors of modern Homo sapiens inhabit Kenya?</h3><p>in the Pleistocene epoch</p><p>Pleistocene epoch</p><p>Pleistocene epoch</p><h3>Who helped discover the Turkana Boy?</h3><p>Richard Leakey</p><p>Kamoya Kimeu</p><p>Kamoya Kimeu</p><h3>How old was Turkana Boy?</h3><p>.6-million-year-old</p><p>1.6-million-year-old</p><p>1.6-million-year-old</p><h3>Who was responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at Ologesailie and Hyrax Hill?</h3><p>Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey</p><p>Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey</p><p>Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey</p><h2>The Swahili built Mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city-states, as well as commercial centres in Persia, Arabia, and even India.

Among the cities that line the Kenyan coast is the City of Malindi. It has remained an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the African Great Lakes region. Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers. In 1414, the Chinese trader and explorer Zheng He representing the Ming Dynasty visited the East African coast on one of his last 'treasure voyages'. Malindi authorities welcomed the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.</h2><h3>Where do many merchants and explorers go?</h3><p>the Kenyan Coast</p><p>Kenyan Coast</p><p>Kenyan Coast</p><h3>What is an important Swahili settlement along the coast?</h3><p>City of Malindi</p><p>City of Malindi</p><p>City of Malindi</p><h3>When was the City of Malindi established?</h3><p>14th century</p><p>14th century</p><p>14th century</p><h2>At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the governors of British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck took command of the German military forces, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from Germany, von Lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia) fourteen days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.</h2><h3>When was the outbreak of World War I?</h3><p>August 1914</p><p>August 1914</p><p>August 1914</p><h3>What two governors agreed to a truce to protect their young colonies?</h3><p>governors of British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa</p><p>British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa</p><p>British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa</p><h3>Who was in command of the German military forces?</h3><p>Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</p><p>Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</p><p>Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</p><h3>How did von Lettow conduct his group?</h3><p>effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated</p><p>guerrilla warfare campaign</p><p>guerrilla warfare</p><h3>Where did von Lettow surrender at?</h3><p>Northern Rhodesia</p><p>Northern Rhodesia</p><p>Northern Rhodesia</p><h2>The central highlands were already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu people, most of whom had no land claims in European terms and lived as itinerant farmers. To protect their interests, the settlers banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled. There were 80,000 white settlers living in Kenya in the 1950s.</h2><h3>Where were the Kikuyu people located?</h3><p>The central highlands</p><p>central highlands</p><p>central highlands</p><h3>How did the Kikuyu people live?</h3><p>as itinerant farmers</p><p>itinerant farmers</p><p>itinerant farmers</p><h3>How did the settlers protect their interests?</h3><p>banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour</p><p>banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land</p><p>banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land</p><h3>How many white settlers were living in Kenya in the 1950's?</h3><p>80,000</p><p>80,000</p><p>80,000</p><h2>The capture of Warũhiũ Itote (aka General China) on 15 January 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure. Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the British Army and King's African Rifles. By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents. The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive. During this period, substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred. The most important of these was the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.</h2><h3>When was Waruhiu Itote captured?</h3><p>15 January 1954</p><p>15 January 1954</p><p>15 January 1954</p><h3>What did this help accomplish?</h3><p>the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure</p><p>better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure</p><p>a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure</p><h3>When did Operation Anvil open?</h3><p>24 April 1954</p><p>24 April 1954</p><p>24 April 1954</p><h3>How many of the Mau Mau did Home Gaurd kill?</h3><p>4,686 Mau Mau</p><p>4,686</p><p>4,686</p><h3>What was the most important governmental change to land tenure?</h3><p>the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.</p><p>Swynnerton Plan</p><p>Swynnerton Plan</p><h2>The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957. Despite British hopes of handing power to &quot;moderate&quot; local rivals, it was the Kenya African National Union (KANU) of Jomo Kenyatta that formed a government. The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963 with independence being conferred on all of Kenya. The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya and, under an agreement dated 8 October 1963, the Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the Colony of Kenya, the Sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would be one sovereign, independent state. In this way, Kenya became an independent country under the Kenya Independence Act 1963 of the United Kingdom. Exactly 12 months later on 12 December 1964, Kenya became a republic under the name &quot;Republic of Kenya&quot;.</h2><h3>When was the first direct elections for native Kenyans?</h3><p>1957</p><p>1957</p><p>1957</p><h3>Who formed the government in Kenya?</h3><p>Kenya African National Union (KANU) of Jomo Kenyatta</p><p>Kenya African National Union</p><p>Kenya African National Union</p><h3>When did the different colonies come together and form Kenya?</h3><p>12 December 1963</p><p>12 December 1963</p><p>8 October 1963</p><h3>When did Kenya become an independent country?</h3><p>1963</p><p>Kenya Independence Act</p><p>1963</p><h3>What did Kenya name itself on December 12, 1964? </h3><p>Republic of Kenya</p><p>Republic of Kenya</p><p>Republic of Kenya</p><h2>The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the mlolongo (queuing) system, where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of a secret ballot.

Several contentious clauses, including one that allowed for only one political party were changed in the following years.

After a split which took a crucial 8% of the votes away from the ODM to the newly formed Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya (ODM-K)'s candidate, Kalonzo Musyoka, the race tightened between ODM candidate Raila Odinga and Kibaki. As the count came into the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) headquarters, Odinga was shown to have a slight, and then substantial lead as the results from his strongholds came in early. As the ECK continued to count the votes, Kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later. This led to protests and open discrediting of the ECK for complicity and to Odinga declaring himself the &quot;people's president&quot; and calling for a recount.</h2><h3>What party is President Kibaki part of?</h3><p>Party of National Unity</p><p>Party of National Unity</p><p>Party of National Unity</p><h3>Who did President Kibaki run against?</h3><p>the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)</p><p>Kalonzo Musyoka</p><p>Orange Democratic Movement</p><h3>What led to protests and open discrediting of the ECK?</h3><p>Kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later</p><p>Kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent</p><p>votes from his stronghold arrived later</p><h3>Who called themselves the &quot;People's President&quot;?</h3><p>Odinga</p><p>Odinga</p><p>Odinga</p><h2>Since the election riots, the government and civil society organisations started programmes to avoid similar disasters in the future, said Agnes R.

The tourism sector has exhibited steady growth in most years since independence and by the late 1980s had become the country's principal source of foreign exchange. Tourists, the largest number being from Germany and the United Kingdom, are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves, notably, the expansive East and West Tsavo National Park 20,808 square kilometres (8,034 sq mi) in the southeast. Tourism has seen a substantial revival over the past several years and is the major contributor to the pick-up in the country's economic growth. Tourism is now Kenya's largest foreign exchange earning sector, followed by flowers, tea, and coffee. In 2006 tourism generated US$803 million, up from US$699 million the previous year. Presently, there are also numerous Shopping Malls in Kenya. In addition, there are four main hypermarket chains in Kenya.</h2><h3>How much does the services sector contribute to GDP?</h3><p>61%</p><p>61%</p><p>61%</p><h3>What is the service sector dominated by?</h3><p>tourism</p><p>tourism</p><p>tourism</p><h3>Has the tourism sector had growth or reduction?</h3><p>steady growth</p><p>growth</p><p>growth</p><h3>What attracts the tourists to Kenya?</h3><p>the coastal beaches and the game reserves</p><p>coastal beaches and the game reserves,</p><p>coastal beaches and the game reserves</p><h3>Where is the largest number of tourist coming from?</h3><p>Germany and the United Kingdom</p><p>Germany and the United Kingdom</p><p>Germany and the United Kingdom</p><h2>Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), after the service sector. In 2005 agriculture, including forestry and fishing, accounted for 24% of GDP, as well as for 18% of wage employment and 50% of revenue from exports. The principal cash crops are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee. Horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya's exports. The production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations. Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid—for example, in 2004 aid for 1.8 million people because of one of Kenya's intermittent droughts.[citation needed]</h2><h3>How much of the GDP was agriculture in 2005?</h3><p>24%</p><p>24%</p><p>24%</p><h3>What are the principal cash crops in Kenya?</h3><p>tea, horticultural produce, and coffee</p><p>tea, horticultural produce, and coffee</p><p>tea, horticultural produce, and coffee</p><h3>What is the second largest contrubtor to Kenyas GDP?</h3><p>Agriculture</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>Agriculture</p><h3>What can cause fluctuations in the production of corn?</h3><p>weather-related fluctuations</p><p>weather-related</p><p>weather</p><h2>A consortium led by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties, instead of maize, in particularly dry areas. Pigeon peas are very drought resistant, so can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall. Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.</h2><h3>What institution has helped farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties?</h3><p>International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)</p><p>ICRISAT</p><p>International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics</p><h3>Why did they teach them to grow peas?</h3><p>Pigeon peas are very drought resistant,</p><p>drought resistant</p><p>very drought resistant</p><h3>How did the project encourage the commercialisation of legumes?</h3><p>by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing</p><p>stimulating the growth of local seed production</p><p>stimulating the growth of local seed production</p><h3>How did this effect the producer prices?</h3><p>, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25%</p><p>increase local producer prices by 20–25%</p><p>increase</p><h3>What has the increase of prices caused?</h3><p>enabling some farmers to buy assets</p><p>enabling some farmers to buy assets</p><p>enabling some farmers to buy assets</p><h2>Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. Coconuts, pineapples, cashew nuts, cotton, sugarcane, sisal, and corn are grown in the lower-lying areas. Unfortunately, the country has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty (53% of the population lives below the poverty line), a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid. Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets. This was last seen in August and September 2011 prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross.</h2><h3>Where is the most successful agricultural prodcution regions?</h3><p>the fertile highlands</p><p>fertile highlands</p><p>highlands</p><h3>What is grown in the fertile highlands?</h3><p>Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat</p><p>ea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat</p><p>Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat</p><h3>Where does the livestock of the country normally dominate?</h3><p>the semi-arid savanna to the north and east</p><p>savanna to the north and east</p><p>semi-arid savanna to the north and east</p><h3>What percent live below the povertly line?</h3><p>53% of the population</p><p>53%</p><p>53%</p><h3>What program did Red Cross put together in 2011?</h3><p>Kenyans for Kenya</p><p>Kenyans for Kenya</p><p>Kenyans for Kenya</p><h2>Although Kenya is the most industrially developed country in the African Great Lakes region, manufacturing still accounts for only 14% of the GDP.

Although the 7–4–2–3 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8–4–4 system in 1985, the last batch of students from the former system graduated from Kenyan Universities in 1992.</h2><h3>What was the Presidential Working Party on the Second University commissioned to do?</h3><p>look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in Kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system</p><p>look at both the possibilities</p><p>look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in Kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system</p><h3>What did they want the educational system to be?</h3><p>8–4–4 system</p><p>8–4–4 system</p><p>an 8–4–4 system</p><h3>What is the edcuation system currently?</h3><p>8–4–4 system</p><p>7–4–2–3 system</p><p>7–4–2–3</p><h3>When did the last batch of students that followed the former system graudate?</h3><p>1992</p><p>1992</p><p>1992</p><h2>The current 8–4–4 system was launched in January 1985. It put more emphasis on vocational subjects on the assumption that the new structure would enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment in the informal sector. In January 2003, the Government of Kenya announced the introduction of free primary education. As a result, primary school enrolment increased by about 70%. Secondary and tertiary education enrolment has not increased proportionally because payment is still required for attendance. In 2007 the government issued a statement declaring that from 2008, secondary education would be heavily subsidiszed, with the government footing all tuition fees.</h2><h3>When was the 8-4-4 system launched?</h3><p>January 1985</p><p>January 1985</p><p>January 1985</p><h3>What was the emphasis focuses on?</h3><p>vocational subjects</p><p>vocational subjects</p><p>vocational subjects</p><h3>Why were vocational subjects most important?</h3><p>the new structure would enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment in the informal sector</p><p>enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment</p><p>enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment</p><h3>When was free primary school introduced?</h3><p>January 2003</p><p>January 2003</p><p>January 2003</p><h3>How much did enrollment increase?</h3><p>increased by about 70%.</p><p>70%</p><p>70%</p><h2>Basic formal education starts at age six years and lasts 12 years comprising eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school. Primary school is free in public schools and those who exit at this level can join a vocational youth/village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring, carpentry, motor vehicle repair, brick-laying and masonry for about two years. Those who complete high school can join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years or proceed directly to the university and study for four years. Graduates from the polytechnics and colleges can then join the workforce and later obtain a specialised higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training, or join the university – usually in the second or third year of their respective course. The higher diploma is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor's degree and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities.</h2><h3>What age does basic education start?</h3><p>age six years</p><p>six</p><p>six</p><h3>What is the break down of years at different level of education?</h3><p>eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school.</p><p>eight years in primary school and four years in high school</p><p>eight years in primary school and four years in high school</p><h3>What do students do after primary school?</h3><p>join a vocational youth/village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program</p><p>join a vocational youth/village polytechnic</p><p>four years in high school</p><h3>What can students that complete high school have opportunites to do?</h3><p>join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years or proceed directly to the university and study for four years</p><p>join a polytechnic or other technical college</p><p>join a vocational youth/village polytechnic</p><h2>The country's literacy level stands at 85% of the whole population. Preschool, which targets children from age three to five, is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade). At the end of primary education, pupils sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE), which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training. The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school. Primary school age is 6/7-13/14 years. For those who proceed to secondary level, there is a national examination at the end of Form Four – the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), which determines those proceeding to the universities, other professional training or employment. Students sit examinations in eight subjects of their choosing. However, English, Kiswahili (languages) and mathematics are compulsory subjects.</h2><h3>What is Kenya's literacy rate?</h3><p>85%</p><p>85%</p><p>85%</p><h3>Preschool targest what age children?</h3><p>age three to five</p><p>three to five</p><p>age three to five</p><h3>What is preschool required for?</h3><p>a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade)</p><p>admission to Standard One</p><p>admission to Standard One</p><h3>What does the KCPE determine?</h3><p>those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training</p><p>those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training</p><p>those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training</p><h3>What is the exam at the end of Form Four?</h3><p>the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education</p><p>Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education</p><p>determines those proceeding to the universities</p><h2>Other than the curriculum led learning, there are also National and Public Library Services led by the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS). KNLS is the body mandated to establish, equip, manage and maintain national and public libraries in the country. In addition, some of the counties within the country have either established or taken over libraries within their regions. Nairobi County operates four libraries within their network, which included the McMillan Memorial Library located at the central business district of Nairobi. A public library is seen as a peoples university since it is open to all irrespective of age, literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life.</h2><h3>Who leads the National and Public Library Servies?</h3><p>the Kenya National Library Service</p><p>Kenya National Library Service</p><p>Kenya National Library Service</p><h3>What is the KNLS responsible for?</h3><p>establish, equip, manage and maintain national and public libraries in the country</p><p>establish, equip, manage and maintain national and public libraries</p><p>establish, equip, manage and maintain national and public libraries</p><h3>What is the public library seen as to Kenyans?</h3><p>a peoples university</p><p>peoples university</p><p>peoples university</p><h3>Why is the public library known as a people's university?</h3><p>it is open to all irrespective of age, literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life</p><p>open to all irrespective of age, literacy level</p><p>open to all irrespective of age, literacy level</p><h2>Kenya is active in several sports, among them cricket, rallying, football, rugby union and boxing. The country is known chiefly for its dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics, having consistently produced Olympic and Commonwealth Games champions in various distance events, especially in 800 m, 1,500 m, 3,000 m steeplechase, 5,000 m, 10,000 m and the marathon. Kenyan athletes (particularly Kalenjin) continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from Morocco and Ethiopia has reduced this supremacy. Kenya's best-known athletes included the four-time women's Boston Marathon winner and two-time world champion Catherine Ndereba, 800m world record holder David Rudisha, former Marathon world record-holder Paul Tergat, and John Ngugi.</h2><h3>What sports are Kenyans active in?</h3><p>cricket, rallying, football, rugby union and boxing</p><p>cricket, rallying, football, rugby union and boxing</p><p>cricket, rallying, football, rugby union and boxing</p><h3>What is the country known for?</h3><p>its dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics</p><p>middle-distance and long-distance athletics</p><p>dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics</p><h3>Who dominates the world of long distance running?</h3><p>Kenyan athletes (particularly Kalenjin)</p><p>Kenyan athletes</p><p>Kenya</p><h3>What countries does Kenya compete with for long distance running?</h3><p>Morocco and Ethiopia</p><p>Morocco and Ethiopia</p><p>Morocco and Ethiopia</p><h2>Kenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics, six gold, four silver and four bronze, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics. New athletes gained attention, such as Pamela Jelimo, the women's 800m gold medalist who went ahead to win the IAAF Golden League jackpot, and Samuel Wanjiru who won the men's marathon. Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion Kipchoge Keino helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion Henry Rono's spectacular string of world record performances. Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly Bahrain and Qatar. The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with Bernard Lagat the latest, choosing to represent the United States. Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors. Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country's strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries.[citation needed]</h2><h3>How many gold medals did Kenya win during the Beijing Olympics?</h3><p>six gold</p><p>several</p><p>six</p><h3>How well did Kenya do in the Beijing Olympics?</h3><p>Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics</p><p>Africa's most successful nation</p><p>Africa's most successful nation</p><h3>What else did Pamela Jelimo win after the Olympics?</h3><p>IAAF Golden League jackpot</p><p>IAAF Golden League jackpot</p><p>IAAF Golden League jackpot</p><h3>Why has there been controversy in Kenyan athletics?</h3><p>the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries</p><p>defection of a number of Kenyan athletes</p><p>a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries</p><h3>Why do these defections occur?</h3><p>economic or financial factors</p><p>economic or financial factors</p><p>economic or financial factors</p><h2>Kenya has been a dominant force in women's volleyball within Africa, with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade.[citation needed] The women's team has competed at the Olympics and World Championships but without any notable success. Cricket is another popular and the most successful team sport. Kenya has competed in the Cricket World Cup since 1996. They upset some of the World's best teams and reached semi-finals of the 2003 tournament. They won the inaugural World Cricket League Division 1 hosted in Nairobi and participated in the World T20. Their current captain is Rakep Patel. They participated in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. Kenya is represented by Lucas Onyango as a professional rugby league player who plays with Oldham Roughyeds. Besides the former European Super League team, he has played for Widnes Vikings and rugby union with Sale Sharks. Rugby union is increasing in popularity, especially with the annual Safari Sevens tournament. Kenya sevens team ranked 9th in IRB Sevens World Series for the 2006 season. Kenya was also a regional powerhouse in soccer. However, its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the now defunct Kenya Football Federation, leading to a suspension by FIFA which was lifted in March 2007.</h2><h3>What sport has Kenyan women been a dominate force?</h3><p>women's volleyball within Africa</p><p>volleyball</p><p>volleyball</p><h3>What is the most successful team sport in Kenya?</h3><p>Cricket</p><p>Cricket</p><p>Cricket</p><h3>When did Kenya reach the semi-finals?</h3><p>2003</p><p>2003</p><p>2003</p><h3>Who is the current captian of the cricket team?</h3><p>Rakep Patel</p><p>Rakep Patel</p><p>Rakep Patel</p><h3>When was the suspension by FIFA lifted?</h3><p>March 2007</p><p>March 2007</p><p>March 2007</p><h2>In the motor rallying arena, Kenya is home to the world famous Safari Rally, commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world. It was a part of the World Rally Championship for many years until its exclusion after the 2002 event owing to financial difficulties. Some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally, such as Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae. Although the rally still runs annually as part of the Africa rally championship, the organisers are hoping to be allowed to rejoin the World Rally championship in the next couple of years.</h2><h3>What is Kenya the home of?</h3><p>the world famous Safari Rally</p><p>Safari Rally</p><p>world famous Safari Rally</p><h3>What is the Safair Rally known as?</h3><p>one of the toughest rallies in the world</p><p>toughest rallies in the world</p><p>toughest rallies in the world.</p><h3>Who are some of the best rally drivers that have won the rally?</h3><p>Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae</p><p>Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae</p><p>Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae</p><h2>Kenyans generally have three meals in a day – breakfast in the morning (kiamsha kinywa), lunch in the afternoon (chakula cha mchana) and supper in the evening (chakula cha jioni or known simply as &quot;chajio&quot;).
