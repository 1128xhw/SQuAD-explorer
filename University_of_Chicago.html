<html><body><div><h1>University_of_Chicago</h1><h2>The University of Chicago (UChicago, Chicago, or U of C) is a private research university in Chicago. The university, established in 1890, consists of The College, various graduate programs, interdisciplinary committees organized into four academic research divisions and seven professional schools. Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago is also well known for its professional schools, which include the Pritzker School of Medicine, the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the Law School, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies and the Divinity School. The university currently enrolls approximately 5,000 students in the College and around 15,000 students overall.</h2><h3>What kind of university is the University of Chicago?</h3><p>a private research university</p><p>private research</p><p>private research university</p><p>private research university</p><h3>When was the University of Chicago established?</h3><p>1890</p><p>1890</p><p>1890</p><p>1890</p><h3>How many professional schools does the University of Chicago have?</h3><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><h3>How many academic research divisions does the University of Chicago have?</h3><p>four</p><p>four</p><p>four</p><p>four</p><h3>How many students does the University of Chicago have enlisted?</h3><p>5,000</p><p>around 15,000</p><p>15,000</p><p>15,000</p><h2>University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics, the Chicago school of sociology, the law and economics movement in legal analysis, the Chicago school of literary criticism, the Chicago school of religion, and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world-renowned institutions like the nearby Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.</h2><h3>University of Chicago scholars played a major part in what development?</h3><p>various academic disciplines</p><p>various academic disciplines</p><p>the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction</p><p>the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction</p><h3>Who helped develop the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear reaction?</h3><p>Chicago's physics department</p><p>Chicago's physics department</p><p>Chicago's physics department</p><p>Chicago's physics department</p><h3>Where is the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear reaction located?</h3><p>beneath the university's Stagg Field</p><p>Stagg Field</p><p>beneath the university's Stagg Field</p><p>beneath the university's Stagg Field</p><h3>What is the name of the largest university press in the U.S?</h3><p>University of Chicago Press</p><p>University of Chicago Press</p><p>University of Chicago Press</p><p>University of Chicago Press</p><h3>In what year will the Barack Obama Presidential Center be finished?</h3><p>2020</p><p>2020</p><p>2020</p><p>2020</p><h2>Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D. Rockefeller, the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890; William Rainey Harper became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892. Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility. With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities, an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.</h2><h3>What society founded the University of Chicago?</h3><p>the American Baptist Education Society</p><p>American Baptist Education Society</p><p>American Baptist Education Society</p><p>American Baptist Education Society</p><h3>What person helped establish the school with a donation?</h3><p>John D.

Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field. While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus' first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons), Martin A. Ryerson (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.</h2><h3>Who donated property to the University of Chicago?</h3><p>Marshall Field</p><p>Marshall Field</p><p>Marshall Field</p><p>Marshall Field</p><h3>Who helped pay for the university's first building structure? </h3><p>Silas B.

In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.</h2><h3>In 1890, who did the university decide to team up with?</h3><p>several regional colleges and universities</p><p>Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University</p><p>Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University</p><p>Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University</p><h3>What year did the university team up with Shimer College?</h3><p>1896</p><p>1896</p><p>1896</p><p>1896</p><h3>The university agreed to grant a degree to any graduate of affiliate schoos that did what?</h3><p>made a grade of A for all four years</p><p>made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago</p><p>made a grade of A for all four years</p><p>made a grade of A for all four years</p><h3>Who disliked the affiliate program?</h3><p>passed</p><p>Several University of Chicago professors</p><p>Several University of Chicago professors</p><h3>In what year did the affiliate program end?</h3><p>1910</p><p>1910</p><p>Several University of Chicago professors</p><p>1910</p><h2>In 1929, the university's fifth president, Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office; the university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics, instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core, and organized the university's graduate work into its current[when?] four divisions. In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university. During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the University of Chicago Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students. Also, the Committee on Social Thought, an institution distinctive of the university, was created.</h2><h3>Who was the university's 5th president?</h3><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins</p><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins</p><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins</p><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins</p><h3>What was the name given to the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum?</h3><p>the Common Core</p><p>Common Core</p><p>Common Core</p><p>Common Core</p><h3>Why did the 5th president of the university decide to get rid of the football program?</h3><p>to emphasize academics over athletics</p><p>emphasize academics</p><p>an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics</p><p>to emphasize academics over athletics,</p><h3>How long did the 5th president's tenure last?</h3><p>24-year tenure</p><p>24-year</p><p>24-year tenure.</p><p>24-year</p><h3>In what year was the university's 5th president granted his position?</h3><p>1929</p><p>1929</p><p>1929</p><p>1929</p><h2>In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college; in addition, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.</h2><h3>In what year did the university first see a drop in applications?</h3><p>1950s</p><p>early 1950s</p><p>the early 1950s</p><p>the early 1950s</p><h3>Why did the university see a drop in applicants? </h3><p>a result of increasing crime and poverty</p><p>increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood</p><p>increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood</p><p>increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood</p><h3>When were Shimer College students allowed to transfer to the University of Chicago?</h3><p>after their second year</p><p>early 1950s</p><p>after their second year</p><p>after their second year</p><h3>The urban renewal project was intended to help the residents of what neighborhood?</h3><p>Hyde Park</p><p>Hyde Park</p><p>Hyde Park</p><p>Hyde Park</p><h3>What did the early entrant program do for potential students?</h3><p>allowed very young students to attend college</p><p>allowed very young students to attend college</p><p>allowed very young students to attend college</p><p>allowed very young students to attend college</p><h2>The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle's office in a protest over the university's off-campus rental policies. After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report. The report, a two-page statement of the university's policy in &quot;social and political action,&quot; declared that &quot;To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures.&quot; The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s.</h2><h3>In what year did student decide to occupy the president's office?</h3><p>1962</p><p>1962</p><p>1962</p><p>1962</p><h3>What made the student decide to occupy the president's office in protest?</h3><p>the university's off-campus rental policies.</p><p>the university's off-campus rental policies</p><p>the university's off-campus rental policies</p><p>the university's off-campus rental policies</p><h3>In what year was the Kalven Report issued?</h3><p>1967</p><p>1967</p><p>1967</p><p>1967</p><h3>How many pages was the Kalven Report statement?</h3><p>a two-page statement</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><h3>What policy did the Kelven Report contain?</h3><p>social and political action</p><p>social and political action</p><p>social and political action</p><p>social and political action</p><h2>From the mid-2000s, the university began a number of multimillion-dollar expansion projects. In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the Milton Friedman Institute which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members and students. The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary. During the same year, investor David G. Booth donated $300 million to the university's Booth School of Business, which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school. In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway. Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center. In 2014 the University launched the public phase of a $4.5 billion fundraising campaign. In September 2015, the University received $100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies.</h2><h3>When did the university decide to start multimillion-dollar expansion projects?</h3><p>mid-2000s</p><p>mid-2000s</p><p>mid-2000s</p><p>the mid-2000s</p><h3>What institute did the university announced to everyone in 2008?</h3><p>Milton Friedman Institute</p><p>Milton Friedman Institute</p><p>Milton Friedman Institute</p><p>Milton Friedman Institute</p><h3>How much did the Milton Friedman Institute roughly cost?</h3><p>around $200 million</p><p>$200 million</p><p>$200 million</p><p>$200 million</p><h3>What buildings held the Milton Friedman Institute?</h3><p>the Chicago Theological Seminary</p><p>Chicago Theological Seminary</p><p>Chicago Theological Seminary</p><p>Chicago Theological Seminary</p><h3>Who decide to make a very large donation to the university's Booth School of Business?</h3><p>David G.

The Main Quadrangles consist of six quadrangles, each surrounded by buildings, bordering one larger quadrangle. The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Holabird &amp; Roche, and other architectural firms in a mixture of the Victorian Gothic and Collegiate Gothic styles, patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford. (Mitchell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford's Magdalen Tower, and the university Commons, Hutchinson Hall, replicates Christ Church Hall.)</h2><h3>What are the first buildings the university built knows as today?</h3><p>the Main Quadrangles</p><p>Main Quadrangles</p><p>the Main Quadrangles</p><p>the Main Quadrangles</p><h3>How many quadrangles does the Main Quadrangles have?</h3><p>six</p><p>six quadrangles</p><p>six</p><p>six</p><h3>Who helped designed the Main Quadrangles?</h3><p>Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Holabird &amp; Roche,</p><p>Henry Ives Cobb</p><p>Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Holabird &amp; Roche, and other architectural firms</p><p>Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Holabird &amp; Roche, and other architectural firms</p><h3>The Mitchell Tower is designed to look like what Oxford tower?</h3><p>Oxford's Magdalen Tower</p><p>Magdalen Tower</p><p>Magdalen Tower</p><p>Magdalen Tower</p><h3>Hutchinson Hall was designed to look like what Oxford hall?</h3><p>Christ Church Hall</p><p>Christ Church Hall</p><p>Christ Church Hall</p><p>Christ Church Hall</p><h2>After the 1940s, the Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles. In 1955, Eero Saarinen was contracted to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen); a series of arts buildings; a building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the university's School of Social Service Administration;, a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone, and the Regenstein Library, the largest building on campus, a brutalist structure designed by Walter Netsch of the Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, and other construction, expansions, and restorations. In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.</h2><h3>During what decade did the campus start to look more modern?</h3><p>the 1940s</p><p>After the 1940s</p><h3>Who was assigned to design a second master plan?</h3><p>Eero Saarinen</p><p>Eero Saarinen</p><p>Eero Saarinen</p><h3>What administration did Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designa buiding?</h3><p>School of Social Service Administration</p><p>School of Social Service Administration</p><p>the university's School of Social Service Administration</p><h3>What public policy school found it's home in the building that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed?</h3><p>Harris School of Public Policy Studies</p><p>Harris School of Public Policy Studies</p><p>the Harris School of Public Policy Studies</p><h3>When was the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center constructed?</h3><p>2003</p><p>2003</p><h2>The University of Chicago also maintains facilities apart from its main campus. The university's Booth School of Business maintains campuses in Singapore, London, and the downtown Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago. The Center in Paris, a campus located on the left bank of the Seine in Paris, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs. In fall 2010, the University of Chicago also opened a center in Beijing, near Renmin University's campus in Haidian District. The most recent additions are a center in New Delhi, India, which opened in 2014, and a center in Hong Kong which opened in 2015.</h2><h3>What other locations can the Booth School of Business be found?</h3><p>Singapore, London, and the downtown Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago</p><p>Singapore, London, and the downtown Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago</p><p>Singapore, London, and the downtown Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago</p><h3>The Center in Paris is located near what river?</h3><p>Seine</p><p>Seine</p><p>the Seine</p><h3>The university established a center in Beijing in what year?</h3><p>2010</p><p>2010</p><p>2010</p><h3>The university's center in Beijing is located next to what school's campus?</h3><p>Renmin University</p><p>Renmin University</p><p>Renmin University</p><h3>What year did the university open a center in Hong Kong?</h3><p>2015</p><p>2015</p><p>2015</p><h2>The University of Chicago is governed by a board of trustees.

The university's sociology department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the Chicago school of sociology. In physics, the university was the site of the Chicago Pile-1 (the first self-sustained man-made nuclear reaction, part of the Manhattan Project), of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment that calculated the charge of the electron, and of the development of radiocarbon dating by Willard F. Libby in 1947. The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, the Miller–Urey experiment, was conducted at the university. REM sleep was discovered at the university in 1953 by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky.</h2><h3>What role in economics did the university play a major part in?</h3><p>shaping ideas about the free market</p><p>shaping ideas about the free market</p><p>shaping ideas about the free market</p><h3>What was the name of the first self-sustained man-made nuclear reaction?</h3><p>Chicago Pile-1</p><p>Chicago Pile-1</p><h3>What was the name of the experiment that tested how life originated?</h3><p>Miller–Urey experiment</p><p>Miller–Urey experiment</p><p>Chicago Pile-1</p><h3>When was REM sleep discovered?</h3><p>1953</p><p>1953</p><p>1953</p><h2>The UChicago Arts program joins academic departments and programs in the Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in Cinema &amp; Media studies since 2000, a master of fine arts in visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, Cinema &amp; Media studies (1996) and theater &amp; performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, music, and visual arts” requirement, requiring students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.</h2><h3>Since what year did the university offer a doctorate in music composition?</h3><p>1933</p><p>1933</p><p>1933</p><h3>Since what year did the university offer a doctorate in Cinema &amp; Media studies?</h3><p>2000</p><p>2000</p><p>2000</p><h3>When did the university start having a bachelor's degree program in Cinema &amp; Media studies?</h3><p>1996</p><p>1996</p><p>1996</p><h3>When did the university start having a bachelor's degree program in theater &amp; performance studies?</h3><p>2002</p><p>2002</p><p>2002</p><h3>Around roughly how many students enroll yearly in creative and performing arts classes?</h3><p>Several thousand</p><p>Several thousand</p><p>Several thousand</p><h2>In the fall quarter of 2014, the University of Chicago enrolled 5,792 students in the College, 3,468 students in its four graduate divisions, 5,984 students in its professional schools, and 15,244 students overall. In the 2012 Spring Quarter, international students comprised almost 19% of the overall study body, over 26% of students were domestic ethnic minorities, and about 44% of enrolled students were female.

The university was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and participated in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball and Football and was a regular participant in the Men's Basketball tournament. In 1935, the University of Chicago reached the Sweet Sixteen. In 1935, Chicago Maroons football player Jay Berwanger became the first winner of the Heisman Trophy. However, the university chose to withdraw from the conference in 1946 after University President Robert Maynard Hutchins de-emphasized varsity athletics in 1939 and dropped football. (In 1969, Chicago reinstated football as a Division III team, resuming playing its home games at the new Stagg Field.)</h2><h3>The Maroons are apart of what association?</h3><p>the University Athletic Association</p><p>University Athletic Association (UAA)</p><p>University Athletic Association (UAA)</p><h3>The Maroons compete in what league division?</h3><p>NCAA's Division III</p><p>NCAA's Division III</p><h3>The university was a founding force behind what conference?</h3><p>the Big Ten Conference</p><p>Big Ten Conference</p><p>the Big Ten Conference</p><h3>What player first won the Heisman Trophy for the university?</h3><p>Jay Berwanger</p><p>Jay Berwanger</p><p>Jay Berwanger</p><h3>Why did the university eventually leave the conference?</h3><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins de-emphasized varsity athletics</p><p>University President Robert Maynard Hutchins de-emphasized varsity athletics</p><p>University President Robert Maynard Hutchins de-emphasized varsity athletics in 1939</p><h2>Students at the University of Chicago run over 400 clubs and organizations known as Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs).
