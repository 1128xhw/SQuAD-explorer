<html><body><div><h1>Teacher</h1><h2>The role of teacher is often formal and ongoing, carried out at a school or other place of formal education. In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college. These professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy, the science of teaching. Teachers, like other professionals, may have to continue their education after they qualify, a process known as continuing professional development. Teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning, providing a course of study which is called the curriculum.</h2><h3>What is a course of study called?</h3><p>the curriculum.</p><p>curriculum</p><p>curriculum</p><h3>What is another name to describe the science of teaching?</h3><p>pedagogy</p><p>pedagogy</p><p>formal education</p><h3>Where do most teachers get their credentials from?</h3><p>university or college.</p><p>university</p><p>university or college</p><h3>What can a teacher use to help students learn?</h3><p>lesson plan</p><p>lesson plan</p><p>lesson plan</p><h3>Where is a teacher most likely to be teaching at?</h3><p>school</p><p>school</p><p>school</p><h2>A teacher's role may vary among cultures.

Different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy. When deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority. Many times, teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips. The increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade, has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom.</h2><h3>What is another way of learning that is not formal?</h3><p>informal</p><p>informal</p><p>informal</p><h3>What is a name for the different ways to instruct students?</h3><p>pedagogy</p><p>pedagogy</p><p>pedagogy</p><h3>What is a typical name for learning that is not inside of the classroom?</h3><p>field trips</p><p>field trips</p><p>field trips</p><h3>What has started to change the way teachers teach in the classroom, generally?</h3><p>increasing use of technology</p><p>use of technology,</p><p>increasing use of technology</p><h3>What has risen to be a factor in teaching today?</h3><p>the internet</p><p>the internet</p><p>technology</p><h2>The objective is typically a course of study, lesson plan, or a practical skill.

Understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of teaching styles. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly. For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: &quot;The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all. This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game.&quot;</h2><h3>What would a teacher assess the levels of a student on?</h3><p>particular skills</p><p>educational</p><p>particular skills</p><h3>In what areas does most of the learning take place?</h3><p>self-study and problem solving</p><p>classroom</p><p>in self-study and problem solving</p><h3>What would a teacher do for someone who is timid?</h3><p>encourage</p><p>encourage</p><p>encourage</p><h3>What would a teacher do for someone who is cocky?</h3><p>deflate</p><p>deflate</p><p>deflate</p><h3>What function is a teacher's role similar to?</h3><p>a coach</p><p>coach</p><p>coach</p><h2>Perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children. In primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum. In secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers. The relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor, specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day.</h2><h3>What's the biggest difference in the teaching relationship for primary and secondary school?</h3><p>the relationship between teachers and children</p><p>the relationship between teachers and children.</p><p>the relationship between teachers and children.</p><p>the relationship between teachers and children</p><h3>What does a teacher teach in primary school?</h3><p>the whole curriculum</p><p>whole curriculum</p><p>whole curriculum</p><p>the whole curriculum</p><h3>Who teaches in secondary schools?</h3><p>different subject specialists</p><p>subject specialists</p><p>subject specialists</p><p>teachers</p><h3>Which type of school has a closer teacher-child relationship?</h3><p>primary school</p><p>primary</p><p>primary</p><p>primary school</p><h3>What type of parenting role does a teacher take on?</h3><p>surrogate</p><p>surrogate</p><p>surrogate</p><p>surrogate</p><h2>This is true throughout most of the United States as well. However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist. One of these, sometimes referred to as a &quot;platoon&quot; system, involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject. The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects. Students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.</h2><h3>What type of approaches for primary school are available that are different than the norm?</h3><p>alternative</p><p>alternative</p><p>platoon&quot; system</p><h3>What type of system takes students from one specialist to another for each subject?</h3><p>platoon</p><p>platoon</p><p>platoon&quot; system</p><h3>In a platoon style teaching, what gives the children security?</h3><p>staying with the same group of peers for all classes</p><p>staying with the same group of peers for all classes</p><p>by staying with the same group of peers for all classes</p><h3>The teacher's in a platoon style teaching are usually more _____?</h3><p>knowledgeable</p><p>knowledgeable</p><p>knowledgeable</p><h3>What country is this teaching subject discussing?</h3><p>United States</p><p>United States</p><p>United States</p><h2>Co-teaching has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions. Co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom. Co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential. Co-teachers work in sync with one another to create a climate of learning.</h2><h3>What is a new trend in teaching?</h3><p>Co-teaching</p><p>Co-teaching</p><p>Co-teaching</p><h3>How many teachers are usually involved when co-teaching?</h3><p>two or more</p><p>two or more</p><p>two or more</p><h3>What does co-teaching get the students to focus on?</h3><p>learning</p><p>learning</p><p>learning</p><h3>How do co-teachers work with each other to fulfill the needs of students?</h3><p>harmoniously</p><p>in sync</p><p>harmoniously</p><h3>What type of support does co-teaching provide?</h3><p>social networking support</p><p>social networking</p><p>social networking</p><h2>Throughout the history of education the most common form of school discipline was corporal punishment.

Private schools in these and most other states may also use it. Corporal punishment in American schools is administered to the seat of the student's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle. This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway, but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office.</h2><h3>How many US states do no practice corporal punishment?</h3><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><h3>Where is corporal punishment practiced the most?</h3><p>the South</p><p>the South</p><p>the South</p><h3>Is corporal punishment increasing or declining in the South?</h3><p>declining</p><p>declining</p><p>declining</p><h3>What tool is used in corporal punishment?</h3><p>a specially made wooden paddle</p><p>wooden paddle</p><p>wooden paddle</p><h3>Where is corporal punishment usually performed these days?</h3><p>privately in the principal's office</p><p>principal's office.</p><p>principal's office</p><h2>Official corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.

During detention, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a punishment essay, or sit quietly.</h2><h3>What is a common punishment in Singapore?</h3><p>detention</p><p>detention</p><p>detention</p><h3>What is a common punishment in the UK and Ireland?</h3><p>detention</p><p>detention</p><p>detention</p><h3>Where does the pupil remain while in detention</h3><p>in schools</p><p>school</p><p>school</p><h3>If a detention requires a pupil to just sit there, how are they required to sit?</h3><p>quietly</p><p>quietly</p><p>quietly</p><h3>If a detention asks the student to write, what do they write?</h3><p>lines or a punishment essay</p><p>punishment essay</p><p>lines or a punishment essay</p><h2>A modern example of school discipline in North America and Western Europe relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class. Positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm, clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Teachers are expected to respect their students; sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.[verification needed]</h2><h3>What type of teacher is required in the Western Europe model of discipline?</h3><p>assertive</p><p>assertive</p><p>assertive</p><h3>What is the balance for positive reinforcement?</h3><p>immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior</p><p>immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm, clear boundaries</p><p>immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior</p><h3>What type of boundaries help to define the way kids behave?</h3><p>firm, clear boundaries</p><p>firm, clear</p><p>clear</p><h3>What is not considered appropriate disclipine?</h3><p>sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils</p><p>sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils</p><p>sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils</p><h3>What are teachers expected to give their students?</h3><p>respect</p><p>respect</p><p>respect</p><h2>Whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics, some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline.[citation needed] Such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently. This viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries—in East Asia for instance—that combine strict discipline with high standards of education.[citation needed]</h2><h3>Who wants a more confrontational type of discipline?</h3><p>some teachers and parents</p><p>some teachers and parents</p><p>some teachers and parents advocate</p><h3>What countries are used as an example of harsher discipline with successful education?</h3><p>East Asia</p><p>East Asia</p><p>countries—in East Asia</p><h3>What do critics think the cause of problems with modern schooling is?</h3><p>weakness in school discipline</p><p>weakness in school discipline</p><p>the weakness in school discipline</p><h3>What type of discipline do critics want to see?</h3><p>a more assertive and confrontational style</p><p>strict discipline</p><p>more assertive and confrontational</p><h2>It's not clear, however that this stereotypical view reflects the reality of East Asian classrooms or that the educational goals in these countries are commensurable with those in Western countries. In Japan, for example, although average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in Western countries, classroom discipline and behavior is highly problematic. Although, officially, schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior, in practice many teachers find the students unmanageable and do not enforce discipline at all.</h2><h3>What country has higher scores on standardized tests than the U.S.?</h3><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><h3>What country has such unmanageable students that many teachers do not discipline them?</h3><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><h3>What country has a problem with classroom discipline, even though scores on tests are high?</h3><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><h3>What country's schools have codes of behavior that are very strict?</h3><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><p>Japan</p><h2>Where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students, maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction, leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught. In response, teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students, ignoring attention-seeking and disruptive students. The result of this is that motivated students, facing demanding university entrance examinations, receive disproportionate resources. Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.</h2><h3>What class sizes can make keeping order difficult?</h3><p>40 to 50 students</p><p>40 to 50 students,</p><p>40 to 50 students</p><h3>If the teacher focuses on maintaining order, what does this take time away from?</h3><p>instruction</p><p>instruction</p><p>instruction</p><h3>Who may teachers focus on, in order to prioritize attention?</h3><p>motivated students</p><p>motivated students</p><p>motivated students</p><h3>Who may teachers ignore, in order to prioritize attention?</h3><p>attention-seeking and disruptive students</p><p>attention-seeking and disruptive students</p><p>attention-seeking and disruptive students</p><h3>Who ends up getting more of the teacher's resources in this scenario?</h3><p>motivated students</p><p>motivated students</p><p>motivated students</p><h2>Sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike. They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else. Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront. Sudbury model democratic schools' proponents argue that a school that has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws, is a school in which community discipline prevails, and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, authority is absolute, punishment is capricious, and due process of law is unknown.</h2><h3>What type of authority do Sudbury schools prefer?</h3><p>popularly based authority</p><p>popularly based</p><p>popularly based</p><h3>In addition to schools, where else is popularly based authority effective?</h3><p>governments</p><p>governments</p><p>governments</p><h3>What is the atmosphere in a school using popularly based authority?</h3><p>persuasion and negotiation</p><p>persuasion and negotiation</p><p>persuasion and negotiation</p><h3>In schools using popularly based authority, what is public order like?</h3><p>easier and more efficient</p><p>easier and more efficient</p><p>easier and more efficient</p><h3>What must be passed using democratic means by the entire school community?</h3><p>good, clear laws</p><p>laws</p><p>laws</p><h2>Since teachers can affect how students perceive the course materials, it has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials. On teacher/course evaluations, it was found that teachers who have a positive disposition towards the course content tend to transfer their passion to receptive students. These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis. One of the difficulties in this approach is that teachers may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject which in turn bores the students as well. Students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials.</h2><h3>What must a teacher show towards the course materials for increase learning?</h3><p>enthusiasm</p><p>enthusiasm</p><p>enthusiasm</p><h3>What gets transferred to students who are receptive to the teacher?</h3><p>passion</p><p>passion</p><p>passion</p><h3>What do these teachers NOT do?</h3><p>teach by rote</p><p>teach by rote</p><p>teach by rote</p><h3>How do students rate teachers that they feel are enthusiastic?</h3><p>higher</p><p>higher</p><p>higher than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm</p><h2>Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged, interested, energetic, and curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom. Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.</h2><h3>What increases student's motivation to learn?</h3><p>teacher enthusiasm</p><p>enthusiasm</p><p>teacher enthusiasm</p><h3>Students exposed to an enthusiastic teacher usually did what more often outside class?</h3><p>read lecture material</p><p>read lecture material</p><p>read lecture material</p><h3>What is dramatic gesturing an example of?</h3><p>nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm</p><p>nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm</p><p>nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm</p><h3>What type of studies explored student motivation?</h3><p>Controlled, experimental studies</p><p>Controlled, experimental</p><p>Controlled, experimental</p><h3>Nonverbal expressions resulted in what kind of levels of motivation to learn?</h3><p>higher</p><p>higher levels</p><p>higher levels</p><h2>There are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation. Teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter. Enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process. The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning. Also, enthusiasm may act as a &quot;motivational embellishment&quot;; increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material. Finally, the concept of emotional contagion, may also apply. Students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher.[citation needed]</h2><h3>Enthusiastic teachers may cause students to become more ____ about their learning process?</h3><p>self-determined</p><p>self-determined</p><p>self-determined</p><h3>What may cause &quot;motivational embellishment&quot;?</h3><p>enthusiasm</p><p>enthusiasm</p><p>enthusiasm</p><h3>What is the term for catching the motivation expressed by the teacher?</h3><p>emotional contagion</p><p>emotional contagion</p><p>emotional contagion</p><h3>What might cause a higher student interest in learning the presented subject?</h3><p>Teacher enthusiasm</p><p>excitement</p><p>Teacher enthusiasm</p><h2>Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships. Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students. Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement. Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior. A teacher must guide his student in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals. Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.</h2><h3>What is student motivation about school linked to?</h3><p>student-teacher relationships</p><p>student-teacher relationships</p><p>student-teacher relationships</p><h3>What type of relationships do enthusiastic teachers cause?</h3><p>beneficial</p><p>beneficial</p><p>beneficial</p><h3>What does a student's academic goals include?</h3><p>the goals he receives from his superior.</p><p>goals he receives from his superior.</p><p>personal goals</p><h3>What should a teacher guide a student in?</h3><p>aligning his personal goals with his academic goals.</p><p>aligning his personal goals with his academic goals.</p><p>aligning his personal goals with his academic goals</p><h3>What is strongly linked to good student-teacher relationships?</h3><p>student motivation and attitudes towards school</p><p>student motivation and attitudes towards school</p><p>student motivation and attitudes towards school</p><h2>Students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers.

The three most important aspects of teacher enthusiasm are enthusiasm about teaching, enthusiasm about the students, and enthusiasm about the subject matter. A teacher must enjoy teaching. If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell. They also must enjoy being around their students. A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching. For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well. An enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life.</h2><h3>What is the second aspect of teacher enthusiasm?</h3><p>enthusiasm about the students</p><p>students</p><p>enthusiasm about the students</p><h3>What does a teacher need to be with regards to their subject matter?</h3><p>enthusiastic</p><p>enthusiastic</p><p>enthusiastic</p><h3>A teacher's spark may create a spark where?</h3><p>in the student</p><p>t in the student</p><p>student</p><h3>What can an enthusiastic teacher be to a young student?</h3><p>very influential</p><p>influential</p><p>influential</p><h3>What is important for a teacher to enjoy?</h3><p>teaching</p><p>teaching</p><p>being around their students</p><h2>Misconduct by teachers, especially sexual misconduct, has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts.

The high school student follows an education specialty track, obtain the prerequisite &quot;student-teaching&quot; time, and receive a special diploma to begin teaching after graduation. In addition to certification, many educational institutions especially within the US, require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom.

Many charter schools do not require that their teachers be certified, provided they meet the standards to be highly qualified as set by No Child Left Behind.

However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school. Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com.</h2><h3>In general, what were teachers paid in the past?</h3><p>relatively low salaries</p><p>relatively low salaries</p><p>relatively low salaries</p><h3>What has been getting much better in the most recent years?</h3><p>average teacher salaries</p><p>average teacher salaries</p><p>teacher salaries</p><h3>What two factors can generally increase a teacher's salary?</h3><p>more experience and higher education</p><p>more experience and higher education</p><p>more experience and higher education</p><h3>In a report on K-12 teachers, which teachers had the lowest median salary?</h3><p>elementary school teachers</p><p>elementary school teachers</p><p>preschool teachers</p><h3>What website are teachers using to sell their lesson plans?</h3><p>TeachersPayTeachers.com</p><p>TeachersPayTeachers.com</p><p>TeachersPayTeachers.com</p><h2>There are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in Christianity, across all three major traditions - (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational, with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical Christian traditions with a long tradition of &quot;discernment of spirits&quot;, of vocations, and other aspects of spiritual life, especially the Roman and Orthodox Catholic Churches. These positions include: the honoured but informal position of starets or elder - a man (or, less often, woman), often a monastic, considered to be graced by God with certain gifts for the guidance of souls and the detection and correction of prelest (spiritual pride or deception) - who acts as a spiritual guide or father in the Orthodox Catholic tradition, especially Russian Orthodoxy (see Optina Monastery, which had a long line of said starets); the Priest or Confessor in Roman Catholicism, who is often a man in Holy Orders but may be a monastic or other person respected for his spiritual accomplishments or acumen (even the Pope of Rome has a Confessor, who is not always a bishop, and, due to the hierarchical structure of the Roman Church, can not be his equal in authority), which is often a semi-official to official position, as opposed to the unofficial positions of spiritual guides in the Orthodox Catholic and Protestant traditions; and the almost-exclusively informal arrangements (generally formal only in members who are under some form of church discipline) of mentorship (both of adults and children, in the latter case often a youth pastor) in the Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions, which boundaries can be blurred with the more typically Roman &quot;confessor&quot; position in some of the more historic and conservative Reformation Churches, such as some of the Lutheran and Anglican. In keeping with the individualistic nature of most Protestant denominations, the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is small, with a heavy emphasis placed on heavy reading and personal, Spirit-enlightened interpretation of the Holy Bible.</h2><h3>How many types of religious or spiritual teachers are there in Christianity?</h3><p>many</p><p>three</p><p>many</p><h3>Which denomination has more of an individualistic streak?</h3><p>Protestant</p><p>Protestant</p><p>Protestant</p><h3>Is the Pope's confessor a Bishop?</h3><p>not always</p><p>not always</p><h3>What are the three major traditions present in Christianity?</h3><p>(Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational</p><p>(Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational</p><p>(Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational</p><h2>In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the teacher is an office in the Aaronic priesthood, generally conferred on young boys or recent converts, and has little in common with the &quot;spiritual teacher&quot; archetype. The role of &quot;spiritual teacher&quot; may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all. The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more &quot;low-church&quot; traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders. This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.</h2><h3>What is an abbreviation for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?</h3><p>LDS Church</p><p>LDS Church</p><p>LDS Church</p><h3>Who may be a spiritual teacher in the LDS Church?</h3><p>many individuals</p><p>many individuals</p><p>many individuals</p><h3>What type of mentorship does the LDS Church focus on?</h3><p>spiritual</p><p>spiritual</p><p>spiritual</p><h3>Who is expected to lead the family in spiritual mentorship?</h3><p>the husband and father</p><p>husband and father</p><p>husband</p><h3>Who do Priesthood representatives defer to, at times?</h3><p>the father of the house</p><p>father of the house</p><p>father of the house</p><h2>In Hinduism the spiritual teacher is known as a guru, and, in many traditions of Hinduism - especially those common in the West - the emphasis on spiritual mentorship is extremely high, with gurus often exercising a great deal of control over the lives of their disciples.</h2><h3>What is the name of the spiritual teacher in Hinduism?</h3><p>guru</p><p>guru</p><p>guru</p><h3>Is the focus on spiritual mentorship in Hinduism high or low?</h3><p>extremely high</p><p>high</p><p>extremely high</p><h3>Who do gurus control?</h3><p>their disciples</p><p>lives of their disciples</p><p>disciples</p><h3>In what area is it common for spiritual mentorship to be extremely high?</h3><p>the West</p><p>the West</p><p>the West</p><h2>In Tibetan Buddhism the teachers of Dharma in Tibet are most commonly called a Lama.

In the more spiritual or mystical Islamic tradition of Sufism, the position of spiritual teacher and an esoteric (as opposed to exoteric, or actions-oriented, e.g. the Five Pillars of Islam) spirituality and spiritual knowledge takes on a more important dimension, with emphasis on learning from living saints - the highest of which is a Qutb - and of traditions passed down from initiate to initiate, and traceable back to the founder of the order.</h2><h3>Who teaches the proper way of living in Islam?</h3><p>ulemas</p><p>ulemas</p><p>ulemas</p><h3>Who can decide on legal matters in Islam?</h3><p>ulemas</p><p>ulemas</p><p>ulemas</p><h3>What is the name of the mystical type of Islam?</h3><p>Sufism</p><p>Sufism</p><p>Sufism</p><h3>What is another name for exoteric?</h3><p>actions-oriented</p><p>actions-oriented</p><p>actions-oriented</p><h3>What is the term for the highest living saint?</h3><p>Qutb</p><p>Qutb</p><p>Qutb</p></div></body></html>
