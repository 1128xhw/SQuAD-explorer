<html><body><div><h1>French_and_Indian_War</h1><h2>The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War. The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.</h2><h3>When was the French and Indian War?</h3><p>1754–1763</p><p>1754–1763</p><p>1754–1763</p><p>1754–1763</p><p>1754–1763</p><h3>Who fought in the French and Indian war?</h3><p>colonies of British America and New France</p><p>colonies of British America and New France</p><p>British America and New France</p><p>British America and New France</p><p>the colonies of British America and New France</p><h3>How many people were in French North American Colonies?</h3><p>roughly 60,000 European settlers</p><p>60,000</p><p>60,000</p><p>60,000</p><p>60,000 European settlers</p><h3>How many people were in British North American Colonies?</h3><p>2 million</p><p>2 million</p><p>2 million</p><p>2 million</p><p>2 million</p><h2>The war was fought primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the South to Nova Scotia in the North. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne and present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol.</h2><h3>Where was war fought?</h3><p>primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies</p><p>between New France and the British colonies</p><p>frontiers between New France and the British colonies</p><p>along the frontiers</p><p>Virginia in the South to Nova Scotia in the North</p><h3>How did war start?</h3><p>dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, called the Forks of the Ohio</p><p>dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers</p><p>dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers</p><p>dispute over control</p><p>a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers</p><h3>When did violence start in war?</h3><p>Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754,</p><p>May 1754</p><p>May 1754</p><p>May 1754</p><p>May 1754</p><h2>In 1755, six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock, the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French. None succeeded and the main effort by Braddock was a disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations in 1755, 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed, due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beauséjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians. Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty, were expelled. Native Americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from New England.</h2><h3>When did colonial governors meet with General Edward Braddock about attack on the french?</h3><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><h3>How successful was initial effort by Braddock?</h3><p>disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela</p><p>disaster</p><p>was a disaster</p><p>he was defeated</p><p>None succeeded</p><h3>Why did British operation fail in 1755, 56, 57?</h3><p>combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies</p><p>poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies</p><p>a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies</p><p>poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts</p><p>a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts</p><h3>In 1755 what fort did British capture?</h3><p>Fort Beauséjour</p><p>Fort Beauséjour</p><p>Fort Beauséjour</p><p>Fort Beauséjour</p><p>Fort Beauséjour</p><h3>What order did British make of French?</h3><p>expulsion of the Acadians</p><p>expulsion of the Acadians</p><p>deportation</p><p>expulsion</p><p>deportation</p><h2>After the disastrous 1757 British campaigns (resulting in a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry, which was followed by Indian torture and massacres of British victims), the British government fell. William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France. France concentrated its forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theatre of the war. Between 1758 and 1760, the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada. They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately Quebec. Though the British were later defeated at Sainte Foy in Quebec, the French ceded Canada in accordance with the 1763 treaty.</h2><h3>Who increased British military resources in colonies?</h3><p>William Pitt</p><p>William Pitt</p><p>William Pitt</p><p>William Pitt</p><p>William Pitt</p><h3>How much resources were French placing in North America?</h3><p>unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France</p><p>limited forces</p><p>significantly increased</p><p>France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France</p><h3>Where was France concentraing efforts?</h3><p>against Prussia and its allies in the European theatre of the war.</p><p>Prussia</p><p>against Prussia and its allies</p><p>European theatre</p><p>Prussia</p><h3>Where were British defeated in Canada?</h3><p>Sainte Foy in Quebec</p><p>Sainte Foy</p><p>Sainte Foy in Quebec</p><p>Sainte Foy</p><p>Sainte Foy</p><h2>The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-French conflict. France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain, in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of Florida (Spain had ceded this to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba). France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America.</h2><h3>What territory was ceded to Britain?</h3><p>territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain</p><p>France</p><p>territory east of the Mississippi</p><p>east of the Mississippi</p><p>territory east of the Mississippi</p><h3>What land was ceded to Spain?</h3><p>French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain</p><p>French Louisiana</p><p>French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans)</p><p>Louisiana west of the Mississippi River</p><p>French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans)</p><h3>What was the significance of British win?</h3><p>confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America</p><p>confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America</p><p>confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America</p><p>dominant colonial power</p><p>confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America</p><h2>The conflict is known by multiple names. In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. As there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Other, less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.</h2><h3>When was King George's war?</h3><p>1740s</p><p>1740s</p><p>1740s</p><p>1740s</p><p>1740s</p><h3>What is the confusion of the French and Indian war?</h3><p>Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War</p><p>Indians fought on both sides of the conflict</p><p>obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War</p><p>Seven Years' War</p><p>it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict</p><h3>What was the Seven Years War?</h3><p>much larger conflict between France and Great Britain</p><p>conflict between France and Great Britain</p><p>in King George's reign</p><p>conflict between France and Great Britain</p><p>a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain</p><h3>What are other alternative names for French and Indian War?</h3><p>Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire</p><p>Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire</p><p>Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire</p><p>Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire</p><p>the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire</p><h2>In Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. &quot;Seven Years&quot; refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.</h2><h3>What time framd does the Seven Years War cover?</h3><p>declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763</p><p>1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763</p><p>1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763</p><p>1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763</p><p>the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763</p><h3>How long did the fighting last in Seven Years War?</h3><p>six years</p><p>six years</p><p>six years</p><p>six years</p><p>six years</p><h3>When was Montreal captured?</h3><p>1760</p><p>1760</p><p>1760</p><p>1760</p><p>1760</p><h3>What was first battle in 1754?</h3><p>Battle of Jumonville Glen</p><p>Battle of Jumonville Glen</p><p>Jumonville Glen</p><p>Battle of Jumonville Glen</p><p>Battle of Jumonville Glen</p><h2>The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley, with some also in Acadia (present-day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia, including Île Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island)). Fewer lived in New Orleans, Biloxi, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama and small settlements in the Illinois Country, hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, did business with local tribes, and often married Indian women. Traders married daughters of chiefs, creating high-ranking unions.</h2><h3>What was French population in North America?</h3><p>about 75,000</p><p>75,000</p><p>75,000</p><p>75,000</p><p>75,000</p><h3>Where were French North Americans settled?</h3><p>heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley, with some also in Acadia</p><p>along the St. Lawrence River valley</p><p>St. Lawrence River valley</p><p>along the St. Lawrence River valley</p><h3>Where did French fur trappers travel?</h3><p>St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, did business with local tribes, and often married Indian women</p><p>St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds</p><p>throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds</p><p>St. Lawrence and Mississippi</p><p>the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds</p><h2>British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent, from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north, to Georgia in the south. Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west, as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time their provincial charters were granted. While their population centers were along the coast, the settlements were growing into the interior. Nova Scotia, which had been captured from France in 1713, still had a significant French-speaking population. Britain also claimed Rupert's Land, where the Hudson's Bay Company traded for furs with local tribes.</h2><h3>What was the ratio of British settler to French?</h3><p>20 to 1</p><p>20 to 1</p><p>20 to 1</p><p>20 to 1</p><p>20 to 1</p><h3>Where did British settlers live?</h3><p>from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north, to Georgia in the south</p><p>eastern coast of the continent</p><p>eastern coast of the continent,</p><p>eastern coast</p><p>from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north, to Georgia in the south</p><h3>Where were populations centered in colonies?</h3><p>along the coast, the settlements were growing into the interior</p><p>along the coast</p><p>along the coast</p><p>along the coast</p><p>along the coast</p><h2>In between the French and the British, large areas were dominated by native tribes. To the north, the Mi'kmaq and the Abenaki were engaged in Father Le Loutre's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia, Acadia, and the eastern portions of the province of Canada, as well as much of present-day Maine. The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of present-day Upstate New York and the Ohio Country, although the latter also included Algonquian-speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee, as well as Iroquoian-speaking Mingo. These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule, and were limited by them in authority to make agreements.</h2><h3>In between French and British, what groups controlled land?</h3><p>native tribes</p><p>native tribes</p><p>native tribes</p><p>native tribes</p><p>native tribes</p><h3>What tribes were in Father Le Loutre's War?</h3><p>Mi'kmaq and the Abenaki</p><p>Mi'kmaq and the Abenaki</p><p>the Mi'kmaq and the Abenaki</p><p>Mi'kmaq and the Abenaki</p><p>the Mi'kmaq and the Abenaki</p><h3>Where did Iroquois Confederation control?</h3><p>present-day Upstate New York and the Ohio Country</p><p>present-day Upstate New York and the Ohio Country</p><p>Upstate New York and the Ohio Country</p><p>New York and the Ohio</p><p>Upstate New York and the Ohio Country</p><h3>What rule did some native live under?</h3><p>Iroquois rule, and were limited by them in authority to make agreements</p><p>Iroquois</p><p>Iroquois</p><p>Iroquois</p><p>Iroquois</p><h2>Further south the Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawba, Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw, and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes. When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict. It was not uncommon for small bands to participate on the &quot;other side&quot; of the conflict from formally negotiated agreements, as most tribes were decentralized and bands made their own decisions about warfare.</h2><h3>What are the Siouan-speaking tribes?</h3><p>Catawba, Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw</p><p>Catawba</p><p>Catawba</p><p>Catawba</p><p>Catawba</p><h3>What areas did French recruit natives from?</h3><p>western portions of the Great Lakes region</p><p>Great Lakes</p><p>tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region</p><p>western portions of the Great Lakes</p><p>western portions of the Great Lakes region</p><h3>What tribes supported British?</h3><p>Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee</p><p>Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee</p><p>Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee</p><p>Iroquois</p><p>the Iroquois Six Nations</p><h2>At the start of the war, no French regular army troops were stationed in North America, and few British troops. New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine, companies of colonial regulars (some of whom had significant woodland combat experience). The colonial government recruited militia support when needed. Most British colonies mustered local militia companies, generally ill trained and available only for short periods, to deal with native threats, but did not have any standing forces.</h2><h3>What was Frensh military presence at start of war?</h3><p>no French regular army troops were stationed in North America</p><p>no French regular army troops were stationed in North America</p><p>no French regular army troops were stationed in North America,</p><p>no French regular army</p><p>no French regular army troops were stationed in North America</p><h3>How much British military was in North America at start of War?</h3><p>few British troops</p><p>few</p><p>few</p><p>not have any standing forces</p><p>few British troops</p><h3>What was normal British defense?</h3><p>mustered local militia companies, generally ill trained and available only for short periods, to deal with native threats, but did not have any standing forces.</p><p>local militia companies</p><p>local militia companies</p><p>militia support</p><p>local militia companies</p><h2>Céloron's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians. The expedition covered about 3,000 miles (4,800 km) between June and November 1749. It went up the St. Lawrence, continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario, crossed the portage at Niagara, and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie. At the Chautauqua Portage (near present-day Barcelona, New York), the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River, which it followed to the site of present-day Pittsburgh. There Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country. Whenever he encountered British merchants or fur-traders, Céloron informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.</h2><h3>What was extent of Celeron's expedition?</h3><p>about 3,000 miles (4,800 km) between June and November 1749.</p><p>about 3,000 miles</p><p>3,000 miles</p><p>3,000 miles</p><p>3,000 miles</p><h3>Who was on Celeron's expedition?</h3><p>200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians</p><p>Céloron</p><p>200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians</p><p>200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians</p><p>200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians</p><h3>How did Celeron handle business on trip?</h3><p>British merchants or fur-traders, Céloron informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.</p><p>told them to leave</p><p>Whenever he encountered British merchants or fur-traders, Céloron informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.</p><p>buried lead plates</p><p>Whenever he encountered British merchants or fur-traders, Céloron informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave</p><h2>When Céloron's expedition arrived at Logstown, the Native Americans in the area informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of the French. Céloron continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers, which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, the home of the Miami chief known as &quot;Old Briton&quot;. Céloron threatened &quot;Old Briton&quot; with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the British. &quot;Old Briton&quot; ignored the warning. Disappointed, Céloron returned to Montreal in November 1749.</h2><h3>How did Natives in Logstown take Celeron's information?</h3><p>informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of the French</p><p>informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British</p><p>they owned the Ohio Country</p><p>they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of the French</p><h3>Where did Old Briton call home?</h3><p>village of Pickawillany</p><p>village of Pickawillany</p><p>village of Pickawillany</p><p>Pickawillany</p><p>village of Pickawillany</p><h3>How did Celeron handle meeting with Old Briton?</h3><p>threatened &quot;Old Briton&quot; with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the British</p><p>Céloron threatened &quot;Old Briton&quot; with severe consequences</p><p>threatened &quot;Old Briton&quot; with severe consequences</p><p>threatened</p><p>Céloron threatened &quot;Old Briton&quot;</p><h3>What was Old Briton's response to Celeron?</h3><p>ignored the warning.</p><p>ignored the warning</p><p>ignored the warning</p><p>ignored the warning</p><p>&quot;Old Briton&quot; ignored the warning</p><h2>In his extensively detailed report, Céloron wrote, &quot;All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English. I don't know in what way they could be brought back.&quot; Even before his return to Montreal, reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris, each side proposing that action be taken. William Shirley, the expansionist governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, was particularly forceful, stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present. Conflicts between the colonies, accomplished through raiding parties that included Indian allies, had taken place for decades, leading to a brisk trade in European colonial captives from either side.</h2><h3>How did Celeron feel about Native relations?</h3><p>very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English</p><p>very badly disposed towards the French</p><p>are very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English</p><p>what way they could be brought back</p><p>very badly disposed towards the French</p><h3>How were leaders back in Europe feeling about news from Celeron expedition?</h3><p>proposing that action be taken</p><p>each side proposing that action be taken</p><p>proposing that action be taken</p><p>each side proposing that action be taken</p><h3>How did William Shirley feel about French advancement?</h3><p>British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present</p><p>British colonists would not be safe</p><p>British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present</p><p>British colonists would not be safe</p><p>forceful</p><h2>In 1749 the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country. The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory, and construct a fort for their protection. But, as the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims. In 1750 Christopher Gist, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, explored the Ohio territory and opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown. He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians, through their &quot;Half-King&quot; Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative, agreed to terms that included permission to build a &quot;strong house&quot; at the mouth of the Monongahela River (the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and kept it as hunting ground by right of conquest.</h2><h3>When did British government give land for development of Ohio Country?</h3><p>1749</p><p>1749</p><p>1749</p><p>1749</p><p>1749</p><h3>Who was given land by British goovernment for development of Ohio Country?</h3><p>Ohio Company of Virginia</p><p>Ohio Company of Virginia</p><p>Ohio Company of Virginia</p><p>Ohio Company of Virginia</p><p>Ohio Company</p><h3>Who explored Ohio territory in 1750?</h3><p>Christopher Gist</p><p>Christopher Gist</p><p>Christopher Gist</p><p>Christopher Gist</p><p>Christopher Gist</p><h3>What agreement was made for trade with natives and British?</h3><p>Treaty of Logstown</p><p>1752 Treaty of Logstown</p><p>1752 Treaty of Logstown</p><p>Treaty of Logstown</p><p>Treaty of Logstown</p><h3>According to agreement between Iroquois and British, where was a strong house to be built?</h3><p>mouth of the Monongahela River (the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</p><p>mouth of the Monongahela River</p><p>mouth of the Monongahela River</p><p>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</p><p>the mouth of the Monongahela River</p><h2>The War of the Austrian Succession (whose North American theater is known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. The treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America were turned over to a commission to resolve, but it reached no decision. Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south, were claimed by both sides. The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean, where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.</h2><h3>What was the North American portion of War of Austrian Succession?</h3><p>King George's War</p><p>King George's War</p><p>King George's War</p><p>King George's War</p><h3>What was the end of the War of the Austrian Succession?</h3><p>1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</p><p>signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</p><p>signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</p><p>1748</p><p>the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</p><h3>What issues were not addressed in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle?</h3><p>conflicting territorial claims between British and French</p><p>conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America</p><p>conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America</p><p>conflicting territorial claims</p><p>The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies</p><h3>When a commission reached no decision, what happened?</h3><p>Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south, were claimed by both sides</p><p>Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south, were claimed by both sides</p><p>Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south, were claimed by both sides.</p><p>claimed by both sides</p><p>Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south, were claimed by both sides</p><h2>On March 17, 1752, the Governor-General of New France, Marquis de la Jonquière, died and was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil. His permanent replacement, the Marquis Duquesne, did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post. The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la Marine. Langlade was given 300 men, including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa. His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron's orders to cease trading with the British. On June 21, the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany, capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the Miami nation, including Old Briton.

Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier, but where Céloron had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore. He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. Marin constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French (whom he accused of killing and eating his father). Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf, he threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.</h2><h3>Who took command of French in spring of 1753?</h3><p>Paul Marin de la Malgue</p><p>Paul Marin de la Malgue</p><p>Paul Marin de la Malgue</p><p>Paul Marin de la Malgue</p><p>Paul Marin de la Malgue</p><h3>Where did Marin build first fort?</h3><p>Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania</p><p>Fort Presque Isle</p><p>near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania</p><p>Fort Presque Isle</p><p>near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania</p><h3>Where was Marin's second fort constructed?</h3><p>Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania</p><p>Fort Le Boeuf</p><p>present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania</p><p>Fort Le Boeuf</p><p>present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania</p><h3>What was Marin's orders?</h3><p>protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British</p><p>protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British</p><p>to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British</p><p>protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley</p><p>he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders</p><h3>What native chief travelled to French fort and threatened Marin?</h3><p>Tanaghrisson</p><p>Tanaghrisson</p><p>Tanaghrisson</p><p>Tanaghrisson</p><p>the Mingo</p><h2>The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York.

Learning of a French scouting party in the area, Washington, with Tanaghrisson and his party, surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. The historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships.

After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French. They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition. Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America. In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755. The British, intending to blockade French ports, sent out their fleet in February 1755, but the French fleet had already sailed.

The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown. Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.</h2><h3>What political response was convening in June/July 1754?</h3><p>Albany Congress</p><p>Albany Congress</p><p>the opening of hostilities</p><p>Albany Congress</p><p>Albany Congress</p><h3>What was the goal of congress?</h3><p>formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal</p><p>formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</p><p>formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</p><p>unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</p><p>to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</p><h3>Was the plan formalized?</h3><p>The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown</p><p>was never ratified</p><p>never ratified</p><p>never ratified</p><p>The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified</p><h3>What was the importance of the congress?</h3><p>format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</p><p>became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</p><p>became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</p><p>prototype for confederation</p><p>became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</p><h2>Braddock (with George Washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne.

Approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured. The remaining 500 British troops, led by George Washington, retreated to Virginia.

Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by Shirley's inexperience in managing large expeditions. In conjunction, Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara. As a response, Shirley left garrisons at Oswego, Fort Bull, and Fort Williams (the latter two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at present-day Rome, New York).

He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).</h2><h3>Who was New France's governor?</h3><p>Marquis de Vaudreuil.</p><p>Marquis de Vaudreuil</p><p>the Marquis de Vaudreuil</p><p>Marquis de Vaudreuil</p><p>Marquis de Vaudreuil</p><h3>How did Vaudreuil react when Johnson was seen as larger threat?</h3><p>sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat</p><p>sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</p><p>sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</p><p>sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</p><p>sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</p><h3>Who won the battle of Lake George?</h3><p>inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field</p><p>The battle ended inconclusively</p><p>ended inconclusively</p><p>both sides withdrawing from the field</p><p>The battle ended inconclusively</p><h3>Where did Johnson stop?</h3><p>Fort William Henry</p><p>Fort William Henry</p><p>Fort William Henry</p><p>Fort William Henry</p><p>Fort William Henry</p><h3>Where was French withdrawal to?</h3><p>Ticonderoga Point,</p><p>Ticonderoga Point</p><p>Ticonderoga Point</p><p>Ticonderoga Point</p><p>Ticonderoga Point</p><h2>Colonel Monckton, in the sole British success that year, captured Fort Beauséjour in June 1755, cutting the French fortress at Louisbourg off from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted, and sometimes committing atrocities. More than any other factor, the cutting off of supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise. The Acadian resistance, in concert with native allies, including the Mi'kmaq, was sometimes quite stiff, with ongoing frontier raids (against Dartmouth and Lunenburg among others). Other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians (ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and Île Saint-Jean), the only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757.</h2><h3>Who captured Fort Beausejour?</h3><p>Colonel Monckton</p><p>Colonel Monckton</p><p>Colonel Monckton</p><p>Colonel Monckton</p><p>British</p><h3>How were British able to cut supplies to Louisbourg?</h3><p>deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area.</p><p>deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area</p><p>captured Fort Beauséjour</p><p>captured Fort Beauséjour</p><p>the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population</p><h3>What other clashes were involved in taking Louisbourg?</h3><p>Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757</p><p>Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757</p><p>deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area</p><p>Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek</p><p>Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757</p><h2>Following the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America.

Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain, so he ordered an attack against the forts Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry. In the March Battle of Fort Bull, French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder. They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario, and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies. French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area, encouraging them to raid frontier settlements.

Building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison, Montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects.

He was then ordered by William Pitt, the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies, to attack Louisbourg first. Beset by delays of all kinds, the expedition was finally ready to sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia in early August.

In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies, angered at the lost opportunity for loot, attacked the British column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations; as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward having been exposed to European carriers.</h2><h3>What troops attacked Fort William Henry in early 1757?</h3><p>French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians)</p><p>French irregular forces</p><p>French irregular forces</p><p>French irregular forces</p><p>French irregular forces</p><h3>On what lake did troops attack fort willima henry in winter?</h3><p>Lake George</p><p>Lake George</p><p>Lake George</p><p>Lake George</p><p>Lake George</p><h3>During withdrawal from Fort William Henry, what did some Indian allies of French do?</h3><p>attacked the British column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves.</p><p>attacked the British column</p><p>attacked the British column</p><p>attacked the British</p><p>attacked the British column</p><h2>Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing &quot;bad medicine&quot; as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle. Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.</h2><h3>What was causing New France to have issues with resupplying?</h3><p>British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping.</p><p>British blockade of the French coastline</p><p>British blockade of the French coastline</p><p>British blockade of the French coastline</p><p>British blockade</p><h3>What other reason caused poor supply of New France from a difficult winter?</h3><p>poor harvest</p><p>allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot</p><p>poor harvest in 1757</p><p>poor harvest in 1757</p><p>a poor harvest</p><h3>Where was Montcalm focusing the defense for New France?</h3><p>St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg,</p><p>St. Lawrence</p><p>St. Lawrence</p><p>St. Lawrence</p><p>the defense of the St. Lawrence</p><h2>The British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater, led to the fall from power of Newcastle and his principal military advisor, the Duke of Cumberland. Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops, supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces.</h2><h3>What led to Newcastle's fall from power as military advisor?</h3><p>British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater</p><p>British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater</p><p>British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the Europe</p><p>failures in North America</p><p>British failures in North America</p><h3>Who did Abercrombie replace as commander in chief?</h3><p>Loudoun</p><p>Duke of Cumberland</p><p>Loudoun</p><p>Pitt</p><p>Newcastle</p><h3>Pitt's plan called for what attacks?</h3><p>three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops</p><p>three major offensive actions</p><p>three major offensive actions</p><p>three major offensive actions</p><p>three major offensive actions</p><h3>How many of the Pitt's planned expeditions were successful?</h3><p>Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg</p><p>Two</p><p>Two</p><p>Two</p><p>Two</p><h2>The third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon, in which 3,600 Frenchmen famously and decisively defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia and Native American allies outside the fort the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe.

The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France, and sent funds to Britain's ally on the mainland, Prussia, and the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay. In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships managed to depart France, eluding the British blockade of the French coast.</h2><h3>In 1758 what was duc de Choiseul's plan for focused military efforts?</h3><p>invasion of Britain, to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland</p><p>invasion of Britain</p><p>an invasion of Britain</p><p>invasion of Britain</p><p>an invasion of Britain</p><h3>How successful was the French revised efforts?</h3><p>The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France</p><p>failed</p><p>invasion failed</p><p>failed</p><p>The invasion failed both militarily and politically</p><h3>What naval battles did France lose in 1759?</h3><p>Lagos and Quiberon Bay.</p><p>battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay</p><p>Lagos and Quiberon Bay</p><p>Lagos and Quiberon Bay</p><p>Lagos and Quiberon Bay</p><h2>British victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759, when they finally captured Ticonderoga, James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec (in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders), and victory at Fort Niagara successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south. The victory was made complete in 1760 when, despite losing outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte-Foy, the British were able to prevent the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides.</h2><h3>Who defeated Montcalm at Quebec?</h3><p>James Wolfe</p><p>James Wolfe</p><p>James Wolfe</p><p>James Wolfe</p><p>James Wolfe</p><h3>What was the significance of victory at Forth Niagara for British?</h3><p>cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south</p><p>successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south</p><p>cut off the French frontier forts</p><p>cut off the French frontier forts</p><p>successfully cut off the French frontier forts</p><h3>What battle outside Quebec City did British lose in 1760?</h3><p>Battle of Sainte-Foy</p><p>Battle of Sainte-Foy</p><p>Sainte-Foy</p><p>Battle of Sainte-Foy</p><p>Battle of Sainte-Foy</p><h3>What victory at thwarted efforts of French relief ships.</h3><p>naval Battle of the Restigouche</p><p>Battle of the Restigouche</p><p>Battle of the Restigouche</p><p>Battle of the Restigouche</p><p>Battle of the Restigouche</p><h2>In September 1760, and before any hostilities erupted, Governor Vaudreuil negotiated from Montreal a capitulation with General Amherst.

The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former, but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, for their part, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain, which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, also gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, from France in compensation for its losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.</h2><h3>When did the North American French and Indian War end?</h3><p>signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763</p><p>10 February 1763</p><p>10 February 1763</p><p>10 February 1763</p><p>10 February 1763</p><h3>When was the European portion of the Seven Years War complete?</h3><p>Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763</p><p>15 February 1763</p><p>15 February 1763</p><p>15 February 1763</p><p>15 February 1763</p><h3>What choice did French have for surrendering land?</h3><p>continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique</p><p>surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique</p><p>either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique,</p><p>its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands</p><p>surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique</p><h3>Why did France choose to give up continental lands?</h3><p>value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent</p><p>They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent</p><p>They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater</p><p>value of the Caribbean islands' sugar</p><p>They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent</p><h2>Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from Europe and the colonies further south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands; these latter efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places like Saint-Domingue, and fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. (The French word &quot;Acadien&quot; evolved to &quot;Cadien&quot;, then to &quot;Cajun&quot;.)</h2><h3>How many French colonists were gained by British?</h3><p>80,000</p><p>80,000</p><p>80,000</p><p>80,000</p><p>80,000</p><h3>When was the deportation of Acadians?</h3><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><p>1755</p><h3>Where did British resettle many Acadians?</h3><p>throughout its North American provinces</p><p>throughout its North American provinces</p><p>North American provinces</p><p>North American provinces</p><p>its North American provinces</p><h3>Although some Acadians went to France and other destiantions, what North American city did many move to?</h3><p>New Orleans</p><p>New Orleans</p><p>New Orleans</p><p>New Orleans</p><p>New Orleans</p><h2>Following the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of &quot;popery&quot;; the Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.</h2><h3>Who issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763?</h3><p>King George III</p><p>King George III</p><p>King George III</p><p>King George III</p><p>King George III</p><h3>What was the objective of Royal Proclamation of 1763?</h3><p>outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory</p><p>outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory</p><p>division and administration of the newly conquered territory</p><p>division and administration</p><p>the division and administration of the newly conquered territory</p><h3>What lands were reserved for natives?</h3><p>west of the Appalachian Mountains</p><p>lands west of the Appalachian Mountains</p><p>west of the Appalachian Mountains</p><p>west of the Appalachian Mountains</p><p>west of the Appalachian Mountains</p><h2>For many native populations, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession. The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes. Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.</h2><h3>Where did many Spanish Catholic move after British takeover in Florida?</h3><p>Most went to Cuba,</p><p>Most went to Cuba</p><p>Cuba</p><p>Cuba</p><p>Cuba</p><h3>What made Ohio Country vulnerable?</h3><p>military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes</p><p>construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes</p><p>the construction of military roads to the area</p><p>military roads to the area</p><p>the construction of military roads</p><h3>When was Spanish takeover of Louisiana Territory complete?</h3><p>1769</p><p>1769</p><p>1769</p><p>1769</p><p>1769</p><h3>What natives were displaced by British takeover in Florida?</h3><p>Choctaw and the Creek</p><p>tribes that did not want to do business with the British</p><p>Choctaw and the Creek</p><p>Choctaw and the Creek</p><h3>What did the loss mean to France?</h3><p>disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession</p><p>disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion</p><p>elimination of French power</p><p>.</p></div></body></html>
