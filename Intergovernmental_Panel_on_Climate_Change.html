<html><body><div><h1>Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change</h1><h2>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the United Nations, set up at the request of member governments. It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 43/53. Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP. The IPCC produces reports that support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty on climate change. The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to &quot;stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system&quot;. IPCC reports cover &quot;the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.&quot;</h2><h3>What organization is the IPCC a part of?</h3><p>the United Nations</p><p>the United Nations</p><p>the United Nations</p><h3>What UN organizations established the IPCC?</h3><p>the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</p><p>World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),</p><p>the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</p><h3>What does the UN want to stabilize?</h3><p>greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere</p><p>greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere</p><p>stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere</p><h3>What is the UN's climate change treaty?</h3><p>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</p><p>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</p><p>the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),</p><h3>What UN resolution endorsed the IPCC?</h3><p>Resolution 43/53</p><p>Resolution 43/53</p><p>Resolution 43/53</p><h2>Korean economist Hoesung Lee is the chair of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the election of the new IPCC Bureau. Before this election, the IPCC was led by his vice-Chair Ismail El Gizouli, who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of Rajendra K. Pachauri in February 2015. The previous chairs were Rajendra K. Pachauri, elected in May 2002; Robert Watson in 1997; and Bert Bolin in 1988. The chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs, working group co-chairs, and a secretariat.</h2><h3>Who is the chair of the IPCC?</h3><p>Hoesung Lee</p><p>Hoesung Lee</p><p>Hoesung Lee</p><h3>What nationality is Hoesung Lee?</h3><p>Korean</p><p>onomist</p><p>Korean</p><h3>Who is the vice-chair of the IPCC?</h3><p>Ismail El Gizouli</p><p>Ismail El Gizouli</p><p>Ismail El Gizouli</p><h3>Who was the first chair of the IPCC?</h3><p>Bert Bolin</p><p>Bert Bolin</p><p>Bert Bolin</p><h3>When did Pachauri resign as chair of the IPCC?</h3><p>February 2015</p><p>February 2015</p><p>February 2015</p><h2>The IPCC Panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations. Participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged. Plenary sessions of the IPCC and IPCC Working groups are held at the level of government representatives. Non Governmental and Intergovernmental Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers. Sessions of the IPCC Bureau, workshops, expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only. Attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts. After the opening ceremonies, closed plenary sessions were held. The meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at Sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations.</h2><h3>Who is on the IPCC Panel?</h3><p>representatives appointed by governments and organizations</p><p>representatives appointed by governments and organizations</p><p>representatives appointed by governments and organizations</p><h3>How many people attended the 2003 IPCC meeting?</h3><p>350</p><p>350</p><p>350</p><h3>What kind of people attend the IPCC meetings?</h3><p>government officials and climate change experts</p><p>government officials and climate change experts</p><p>government officials and climate change experts</p><h3>How much of the IPCC attendees are government representatives?</h3><p>about seven-eighths</p><p>seven-eighths</p><p>about seven-eighths</p><h2>The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund, established in 1989 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Costs of the Secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the WMO, while UNEP meets the cost of the Depute Secretary. Annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO, by UNEP, and by IPCC Members; the scale of payments is determined by the IPCC Panel, which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget. The organisation is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO.</h2><h3>When was the IPCC Trust Fund founded?</h3><p>1989</p><p>1989</p><p>1989</p><h3>Who started the IPCC Trust Fund?</h3><p>the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)</p><p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)</p><p>the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO),</p><h3>Who funds the IPCC's Deputy Secretary?</h3><p>United Nations Environment Programme</p><p>UNEP</p><p>UNEP</p><h3>What rules does the IPCC have to follow?</h3><p>the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO</p><p>Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO</p><p>Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO</p><h3>Who funds the IPCC's Secretary?</h3><p>World Meteorological Organization</p><p>WMO</p><p>the WMO</p><h2>The IPCC does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data. Lead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources. According to IPCC guidelines, authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources. Authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources (the &quot;grey literature&quot;), provided that they are of sufficient quality. Examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals. Each subsequent IPCC report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required.</h2><h3>What does the IPCC not do?</h3><p>does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data</p><p>research</p><p>carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data</p><h3>Where do IPCC reports get their information?</h3><p>available information about climate change based on published sources</p><p>published sources</p><p>peer-reviewed sources</p><h3>What is 'grey literature'?</h3><p>non-peer-reviewed sources</p><p>non-peer-reviewed sources</p><p>non-peer-reviewed sources</p><h3>What kind of non-peer-reviewed sources does the IPCC use?</h3><p>model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals</p><p>model results</p><p>model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals</p><h2>Each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material. A chapter typically has two &quot;coordinating lead authors&quot;, ten to fifteen &quot;lead authors&quot;, and a somewhat larger number of &quot;contributing authors&quot;. The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors, ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements, and reporting to the Working Group chairs. Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters.

They predict that under a &quot;business as usual&quot; (BAU) scenario, global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °C per decade during the [21st] century. They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °C over the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability.

The statement, also published as an editorial in the journal Science, stated &quot;we support the [TAR's] conclusion that it is at least 90% certain that temperatures will continue to rise, with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 °C above 1990 levels by 2100&quot;. The TAR has also been endorsed by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, and European Geosciences Union (refer to &quot;Endorsements of the IPCC&quot;).</h2><h3>When was the joint statement on climate change issued?</h3><p>2001</p><p>2001</p><p>2001</p><h3>How many organizations issued the joint statement on climate change?</h3><p>16 national science academies</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><h3>Which journal was the joint statement published in?</h3><p>Science</p><p>Science</p><p>Science</p><h3>How sure did the statement say scientists were that temperatures would keep rising?</h3><p>at least 90%</p><p>at least 90%</p><p>at least 90% certain</p><h3>How much did the statement predict global surface temperature would increase by 2100?</h3><p>between 1.4 and 5.8 °C above 1990 levels</p><p>1.4 and 5.8 °C</p><p>between 1.4 and 5.8 °C</p><h2>IPCC author Richard Lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the TAR. Among his criticisms, Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers (SPM) does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report. For example, Lindzen states that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models. John Houghton, who was a co-chair of TAR WGI, has responded to Lindzen's criticisms of the SPM. Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world's governments, and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence.</h2><h3>Which IPCC author criticized the TAR?</h3><p>Richard Lindzen</p><p>Richard Lindzen</p><p>Richard Lindzen</p><h3>What did Lindzen criticize about the Summary for Policymakers?</h3><p>does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report</p><p>understates the uncertainty associated with climate models</p><p>does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report</p><h3>Who responded to Lindzen's criticisms?</h3><p>John Houghton</p><p>John Houghton</p><p>John Houghton,</p><h3>What was Houghton's role?</h3><p>a co-chair of TAR WGI</p><p>co-chair of TAR WGI</p><p>co-chair of TAR WGI</p><h3>What did Houghton say is necessary for any changes to the SPM?</h3><p>scientific evidence</p><p>must be supported by scientific evidence</p><p>must be supported by scientific evidence</p><h2>In addition to climate assessment reports, the IPCC is publishing Special Reports on specific topics. The preparation and approval process for all IPCC Special Reports follows the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports. In the year 2011 two IPCC Special Report were finalized, the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) and the Special Report on Managing Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). Both Special Reports were requested by governments.</h2><h3>How does the IPCC prepare Special Reports?</h3><p>the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports</p><p>follows the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports</p><p>the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports</p><h3>When was the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) issued?</h3><p>2011</p><p>2011</p><p>2011</p><h3>When was the Special Report on Managing Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) issued?</h3><p>2011</p><p>2011</p><p>2011</p><h3>Why were the 2011 Special Reports issued?</h3><p>requested by governments</p><p>requested by governments</p><p>requested by governments.</p><h2>The IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process. While the preparation of the assessment reports is a major IPCC function, it also supports other activities, such as the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, required under the UNFCCC. This involves publishing default emission factors, which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption, industrial production and so on.</h2><h3>What other activities does the UNFCCC require the IPCC to run?</h3><p>the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme</p><p>Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme</p><p>Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme</p><h3>What is used to estimate emissions?</h3><p>default emission factors</p><p>default emission factors</p><p>default emission factors</p><h3>Levels of what things are used to determine emission factors?</h3><p>fuel consumption, industrial production and so on</p><p>Greenhouse Gas Inventories</p><p>fuel consumption, industrial production and so on</p><h3>What councils assign tasks to the IPCC?</h3><p>WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council</p><p>WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council</p><p>WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council</p><h2>This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers.

Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes (MBH99), which has been referred to as the &quot;hockey stick graph&quot;. This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century. The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007. The MBH99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by Jones et al. 1998, Pollack, Huang &amp; Shen 1998, Crowley &amp; Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000, using differing data and methods. The Jones et al. and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction in Figure 2.21 of the IPCC report.</h2><h3>When was the paper published that the &quot;Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction&quot; graph was based on?</h3><p>1999</p><p>1999</p><p>1999</p><h3>Who wrote the paper that the &quot;Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction&quot; graph was based on?</h3><p>Michael E.

Even at the draft stage, this finding was disputed by contrarians: in May 2000 Fred Singer's Science and Environmental Policy Project held a press event on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., featuring comments on the graph Wibjörn Karlén and Singer argued against the graph at a United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing on 18 July 2000. Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic, which he mis-identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report, and argued that &quot;Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report, the IPCC presented the 'Hockey Stick' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report&quot;. Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that &quot;manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people&quot;. The data and methodology used to produce the &quot;hockey stick graph&quot; was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl &amp; Ammann 2007, which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick.</h2><h3>What range of years was the current warming compared to?</h3><p>between 1000 and 1900</p><p>1000 and 1900</p><p>1000 and 1900</p><h3>Who led the Science and Environmental Policy Project?</h3><p>Fred Singer</p><p>Fred Singer</p><p>Fred Singer</p><h3>Where did Singer hold a press conference in May 2000?</h3><p>Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.</p><p>Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.</p><p>Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.</p><h3>When did Singer dispute the graph at a Senate hearing?</h3><p>18 July 2000</p><p>May 2000</p><p>18 July 2000</p><h3>What Senate committee did Singer speak to in July 2000?</h3><p>United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation</p><p>Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation</p><p>United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation</p><h2>On 23 June 2005, Rep.

Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, said this was a &quot;misguided and illegitimate investigation&quot; apparently aimed at intimidating scientists, and at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation. The National Research Council's report agreed that there were some statistical failings, but these had little effect on the graph, which was generally correct. In a 2006 letter to Nature, Mann, Bradley, and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that &quot;more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached&quot; and that the uncertainties were &quot;the point of the article&quot;.</h2><h3>Who was the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce?</h3><p>Rep.

The ozone case communicated to lay persons &quot;with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture&quot; and related to &quot;immediate risks with everyday relevance&quot;, while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger. The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts. In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem. In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.</h2><h3>Who said people involved in the ozone situation had &quot;a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties&quot;?</h3><p>Sheldon Ungar</p><p>Sheldon Ungar</p><p>Sheldon Ungar</p><h3>What remain unsolved problems with the Kyoto Protocol?</h3><p>varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions</p><p>varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions</p><h3>What conflicts did the ozone mitigation reduce?</h3><p>regional burden sharing conflicts</p><p>regional burden sharing conflicts</p><p>varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions</p><h3>Who ordered the Stern Review?</h3><p>the UK government</p><p>the UK government</p><p>the UK government</p><h2>Since the IPCC does not carry out its own research, it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies, and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report's final release. In principle, this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report cannot be included. In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing, this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science. However, there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next.[citation needed]</h2><h3>What does the IPCC rely on for research?</h3><p>other scientific bodies</p><p>scientific papers and independently documented results</p><p>scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies</p><h3>What can the IPCC's report deadlines cause to be omitted?</h3><p>significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science</p><p>significant new evidence or events that change our understanding</p><p>significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science</p><h3>Who is seen as the ultimate climate change authority?</h3><p>IPCC</p><p>IPCC</p><p>the IPCC</p><h2>In February 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the Fourth Assessment Report, five climate scientists – all contributing or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes to the IPCC. They suggested a range of new organizational options, from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors, to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body, or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated &quot;living&quot; Wikipedia-IPCC. Other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference.</h2><h3>How many scientists called to change the IPCC in Feb 2010?</h3><p>five</p><p>five</p><p>five</p><h3>Where was the Feb 2010 call for change published?</h3><p>the journal Nature</p><p>the journal Nature</p><p>the journal Nature</p><h3>What was one proposal to let the IPCC respond to new evidence faster?</h3><p>turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated &quot;living&quot; Wikipedia-IPCC</p><p>turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated &quot;living&quot; Wikipedia-IPCC</p><p>turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated &quot;living&quot; Wikipedia-IPCC</p><h3>How was it suggested that the IPCC avoid political problems?</h3><p>remove government oversight from its processes</p><p>remove government oversight</p><p>remove government oversight from its processes</p></div></body></html>
