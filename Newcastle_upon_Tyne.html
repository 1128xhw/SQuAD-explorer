<html><body><div><h1>Newcastle_upon_Tyne</h1><h2>Newcastle upon Tyne (RP: i/ˌnjuːkɑːsəl əˌpɒn ˈtaɪn/; Locally: i/njuːˌkæsəl əˌpən ˈtaɪn/), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and Tyneside the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities. Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974.[not in citation given] The regional nickname and dialect for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie.</h2><h3>How many miles south of Edinburgh is Newcastle?</h3><p>103 miles</p><p>103 miles</p><p>103 miles</p><h3>How many miles from the north Sea is Newcastle?</h3><p>8.5 mi</p><p>8.5 mi</p><p>8.5 mi</p><h3>What network is Newcastle a member of?</h3><p>Eurocities</p><p>Eurocities</p><p>the English Core Cities Group</p><h3>What county was Newcastle a part of until 1400?</h3><p>Northumberland</p><p>Northumberland</p><p>county of Northumberland</p><h3>What's the regional nickname for Newcastle and its surrounding area?</h3><p>Geordie</p><p>Geordie</p><p>Geordie</p><h2>The city developed around the Roman settlement Pons Aelius and was named after the castle built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, William the Conqueror's eldest son. The city grew as an important centre for the wool trade in the 14th century, and later became a major coal mining area. The port developed in the 16th century and, along with the shipyards lower down the River Tyne, was amongst the world's largest shipbuilding and ship-repairing centres. Newcastle's economy includes corporate headquarters, learning, digital technology, retail, tourism and cultural centres, from which the city contributes £13 billion towards the United Kingdom's GVA. Among its icons are Newcastle Brown Ale; Newcastle United football club; and the Tyne Bridge. It has hosted the world's most popular half marathon, the Great North Run, since it began in 1981.</h2><h3>Who built a castle in Newcastle in 1080?</h3><p>Robert Curthose</p><p>Robert Curthose</p><p>Robert Curthose</p><h3>What trade was the city an important center of in the 14th century?</h3><p>wool</p><p>wool</p><p>the wool trade</p><h3>What resource was mined in the Newcastle area?</h3><p>coal</p><p>coal</p><p>coal</p><h3>What century was Newcastle's port developed in?</h3><p>16th century</p><p>the 16th</p><p>the 16th century</p><h3>What globally popular half marathon began in 1981?</h3><p>the Great North Run</p><p>the Great North Run</p><p>the Great North Run</p><h2>The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius, a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests that Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius at this period was estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are still visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the &quot;Roman Wall&quot; can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend—the &quot;wall's end&quot;—and to the supply fort Arbeia in South Shields. The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was constructed primarily for defence, to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, not as a fighting line for a major invasion.</h2><h3>What was the first recorded settlement in what became Newcastle?</h3><p>Pons Aelius</p><p>Pons Aelius</p><p>Pons Aelius</p><h3>What river was there originally a bridge across in Roman times?</h3><p>Tyne</p><p>the River Tyne</p><p>the River Tyne</p><h3>What was the estimated population of Pons Aelius around the 2nd century?</h3><p>2,000</p><p>2,000</p><p>2,000</p><h3>Whose wall has fragments visible in places around Newcastle even today?</h3><p>Hadrian's</p><p>Hadrian's</p><p>Hadrian's Wall</p><h3>What tribes were the Romans fearful would invade from the North?</h3><p>Pictish</p><p>Pictish</p><p>Pictish tribes</p><h2>Throughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress. Incorporated first by Henry II, the city had a new charter granted by Elizabeth in 1589. A 25-foot (7.6 m) high stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century, and was created a county corporate with its own sheriff by Henry IV in 1400.</h2><h3>Newcastle served as a northern fortress for which country during the Middle Ages?</h3><p>England's</p><p>England</p><p>England</p><h3>Who granted Newcastle a new charter in 1589?</h3><p>Elizabeth</p><p>Elizabeth</p><p>Elizabeth</p><h3>How high was the stone wall built around Newcastle in the 13th century?</h3><p>25-foot</p><p>25-foot</p><p>25-foot (7.6 m) high</p><h3>What was the name of the King of the Scots?</h3><p>William the Lion</p><p>William the Lion</p><p>William the Lion</p><h3>How many times did Newcastle fight off the Scots during the 14th century?</h3><p>three times</p><p>three</p><p>three times</p><h2>From 1530 a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen. This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town. The phrase taking coals to Newcastle was first recorded contextually in 1538. The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit. In the 18th century American Timothy Dexter, an entrepreneur, widely regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom. He was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him; however his shipment arrived on the Tyne during a strike that had crippled local production; unexpectedly he made a considerable profit.</h2><h3>What did a 1530 royal act restrict shipments of?</h3><p>coal</p><p>coal</p><p>coal</p><h3>What was the cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as?</h3><p>the Hostmen</p><p>the Hostmen</p><p>the Hostmen</p><h3>What does the phrase &quot;taking coals to Newcastle&quot; mean?</h3><p>a pointless pursuit</p><p>a pointless pursuit</p><p>a pointless pursuit</p><h3>What was the American Timothy Dexter widely regarded as?</h3><p>an eccentric</p><p>an eccentric</p><p>an eccentric,</p><h3>What did the merchants of Newcastle plot to do to Timothy Dexter?</h3><p>ruin him</p><p>ruin him</p><p>to ruin him</p><h2>In the Sandgate area, to the east of the city and beside the river, resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families. They were so called because they worked on the keels, boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers, for export to London and elsewhere. In the 1630s about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, more than one-third of the population. Specifically within the year 1636, it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the Society of Antiquaries that 47% of the then population of Newcastle died from the epidemic; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any British City in this period.</h2><h3>Who did the keelmen live with in a tight-knight community east of Newcastle?</h3><p>their families</p><p>their families</p><p>their families</p><h3>How was coal transferred from the river banks to colliers? </h3><p>boats</p><p>keels</p><p>keels</p><h3>How many folks died of plague in Newcastle in the 1630s?</h3><p>7,000</p><p>7,000</p><p>7,000</p><h3>What percentage of Newcastle's population was culled by the plague?</h3><p>47%</p><p>more than one-third</p><p>47%</p><h3>The epidemic in Newcastle was the most what in any British city at the time?</h3><p>devastating loss</p><p>devastating loss</p><p>devastating loss</p><h2>During the English Civil War, the North declared for the King. In a bid to gain Newcastle and the Tyne, Cromwell's allies, the Scots, captured the town of Newburn. In 1644 the Scots then captured the reinforced fortification on the Lawe in South Shields following a siege. In 1644 the city was then besieged for many months and was eventually stormed ('with roaring drummes') and sacked by Cromwell's allies. The grateful King bestowed the motto &quot;Fortiter Defendit Triumphans&quot; (&quot;Triumphing by a brave defence&quot;) upon the town. Charles I was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646–7.</h2><h3>Who did the North declare for during the English civil war?</h3><p>the King</p><p>the King</p><p>for the King</p><h3>Who was Cromwell's allies?</h3><p>the Scots</p><p>the Scots</p><p>the Scots</p><h3>What was roaring as Newcastle was stormed?</h3><p>drummes</p><p>drummes</p><p>drummes</p><h3>What does Fortiter Defendit Triumphans mean?</h3><p>Triumphing by a brave defence</p><p>Triumphing by a brave defence</p><p>Triumphing by a brave defence</p><h3>Who was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646 through 1647?</h3><p>Charles I</p><p>Charles I</p><p>Charles I</p><h2>In the 19th century, shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city's prosperity; and the city was a powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution. This revolution resulted in the urbanization of the city. In 1817 the Maling company, at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city. The Victorian industrial revolution brought industrial structures that included the 2 1⁄2-mile (4.0 km) Victoria Tunnelling, built in 1842, which provided underground wagon ways to the staithes. On 3 February 1879, Mosley Street in the city, was the first public road in the world to be lit up by the incandescent lightbulb. Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting. Innovations in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps, Stephenson's Rocket, Lord Armstrong's artillery, Be-Ro flour, Joseph Swan's electric light bulbs, and Charles Parsons' invention of the steam turbine, which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity. In 1882, Newcastle became the seat of an Anglican diocese, with St. Nicholas' Church becoming its cathedral.</h2><h3>What did the Industrial Revolution cause to happen to Newcastle?</h3><p>urbanization</p><p>urbanization</p><p>the urbanization of the city</p><h3>What was the largest pottery company in the world in 1817?</h3><p>the Maling company</p><p>Maling</p><p>Maling company</p><h3>Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to have what innovation?</h3><p>electric lighting</p><p>the incandescent lightbulb</p><p>the incandescent lightbulb</p><h3>What were shipbuilding and engineering important to Newcastle for in the 19th century?</h3><p>prosperity</p><p>the city's prosperity</p><p>the city's prosperity;</p><h3>What did Charles Parsons invent?</h3><p>the steam turbine</p><p>the steam turbine</p><p>the steam turbine</p><h2>In large parts, Newcastle still retains a medieval street layout. Narrow alleys or 'chares', most of which can only be traversed by foot, still exist in abundance, particularly around the riverside. Stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant Castle Keep, originally recorded in the 14th century, remain intact in places. Close, Sandhill and Quayside contain modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries, including Bessie Surtees House, the Cooperage and Lloyds Quayside Bars, Derwentwater House and &quot;House of Tides&quot;, a restaurant situated at a Grade I-listed 16th century merchant's house at 28–30 Close.</h2><h3>What type of layout does Newcastle's streets have in many parts?</h3><p>medieval</p><p>medieval</p><p>medieval street layout.</p><h3>What are chares?</h3><p>Narrow alleys</p><p>Narrow alleys</p><p>Narrow alleys</p><h3>What runs from the riverside to higher parts of the city center?</h3><p>Stairs</p><p>Stairs</p><p>chares'</p><h3>What kind of buildings are in the towns of Close, Sandhill and Quayside?</h3><p>modern</p><p>modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries</p><p>modern buildings</p><h3>What is the House of Tides?</h3><p>a restaurant</p><p>a restaurant</p><p>a restaurant situated at a Grade</p><h2>The city has an extensive neoclassical centre referred to as Tyneside Classical largely developed in the 1830s by Richard Grainger and John Dobson, and recently extensively restored. Broadcaster and writer Stuart Maconie described Newcastle as England's best-looking city and the late German-born British scholar of architecture, Nikolaus Pevsner, describes Grey Street as one of the finest streets in England. The street curves down from Grey's Monument towards the valley of the River Tyne and was voted England's finest street in 2005 in a survey of BBC Radio 4 listeners. In the Google Street View awards of 2010, Grey Street came 3rd in the British picturesque category. Osborne Road came 4th in the foodie street category. A portion of Grainger Town was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, including all but one side of the original Eldon Square itself.</h2><h3>What has recently undergone extensive restoration?</h3><p>Tyneside Classical</p><p>Tyneside Classical</p><p>Newcastle</p><h3>What did John Dobson describe Newcastle as?</h3><p>England's best-looking city</p><p>England's best-looking city</p><p>England's best-looking city</p><h3>What street does Nikolaus Pevsner think is one of the finest in England?</h3><p>Grey Street</p><p>Grey Street</p><p>Grey Street</p><h3>When was a part of Grainger Town destroyed?</h3><p>in the 1960s</p><p>the 1960s</p><p>the 1960s</p><h3>What is in Eldon Square?</h3><p>Shopping Centre</p><p>Shopping Centre</p><p>the Eldon Square Shopping Centre</p><h2>Another green space in Newcastle is the Town Moor, lying immediately north of the city centre. It is larger than London's famous Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath put together and the freemen of the city have the right to graze cattle on it. The right incidentally extends to the pitch of St. James' Park, Newcastle United Football Club's ground, though this is not exercised, although the Freemen do collect rent for the loss of privilege. Honorary freemen include Bob Geldof, King Harald V of Norway, Bobby Robson, Alan Shearer, the late Nelson Mandela and the Royal Shakespeare Company.

The Newcastle and Gateshead Quaysides are now a thriving, cosmopolitan area with bars, restaurants and public spaces. As a tourist promotion, Newcastle and Gateshead have linked together under the banner &quot;NewcastleGateshead&quot;, to spearhead the regeneration of the North-East. The River Tyne had the temporary Bambuco Bridge in 2008 for ten days; it was not made for walking, road or cycling, but was just a sculpture.</h2><h3>What has replaced the former shipping premises?</h3><p>Large-scale regeneration</p><p>Large-scale regeneration</p><p>new office developments</p><h3>Who commissioned the Gateshead Milennium Bridge?</h3><p>Gateshead Council</p><p>Gateshead Council</p><p>Gateshead Council</p><h3>Who designed the Sage Gateshead music center?</h3><p>Norman Foster</p><p>Norman Foster</p><p>Norman Foster</p><h3>Why have Newcastle and Gateshead linked together under a common banner?</h3><p>tourist promotion</p><p>to spearhead the regeneration of the North-East</p><p>to spearhead the regeneration of the North-East</p><h3>How many days did the River Tyne have the Bambuco Bridge?</h3><p>ten</p><p>ten</p><p>for ten days</p><h2>The historic heart of Newcastle is the Grainger Town area. Established on classical streets built by Richard Grainger, a builder and developer, between 1835 and 1842, some of Newcastle upon Tyne's finest buildings and streets lie within this area of the city centre including Grainger Market, Theatre Royal, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street. These buildings are predominantly four stories high, with vertical dormers, domes, turrets and spikes. Richard Grainger was said to 'have found Newcastle of bricks and timber and left it in stone'. Of Grainger Town's 450 buildings, 244 are listed, of which 29 are grade I and 49 are grade II*.</h2><h3>What is the historic heart of Newcastle?</h3><p>the Grainger Town area</p><p>Grainger Town area</p><p>the Grainger Town area</p><h3>When was Richard Grainger actively building and developing?</h3><p>between 1835 and 1842</p><p>between 1835 and 1842</p><p>between 1835 and 1842,</p><h3>How high are many of the buildings with turrets?</h3><p>four stories</p><p>four stories</p><p>four stories high</p><h3>How man of Grainger Town's 450 buildings are listed?</h3><p>244</p><p>244</p><p>244 are listed,</p><h2>The Grainger Market replaced an earlier market originally built in 1808 called the Butcher Market. The Grainger Market itself, was opened in 1835 and was Newcastle's first indoor market. At the time of its opening in 1835 it was said to be one of the largest and most beautiful markets in Europe. The opening was celebrated with a grand dinner attended by 2000 guests, and the Laing Art Gallery has a painting of this event. With the exception of the timber roof which was destroyed by a fire in 1901 and replaced by latticed-steel arches the Market is largely in its original condition. The Grainger Market architecture, like most in Grainger Town, which are either grade I or II listed, was listed grade I in 1954 by English Heritage.</h2><h3>What earlier market did the Grainger Market replace?</h3><p>the Butcher Market</p><p>the Butcher Market</p><p>the Butcher Market</p><h3>When did Newcastle's first indoor market open?</h3><p>1835</p><p>1835</p><p>in 1835</p><h3>How many guests attended the dinner celebrating the opening of the Grainger Market?</h3><p>2000</p><p>2000</p><p>2000 guests</p><h3>How is the opening of the Grainger Market documented in the Laing Art Gallery?</h3><p>a painting</p><p>a painting</p><p>a painting</p><h3>Who listed the Grainger Market architecture as grade 1 in 1954?</h3><p>English Heritage</p><p>English Heritage</p><p>English Heritage.</p><h2>The climate in Newcastle is oceanic (Köppen Cfb) and significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream (via the North Atlantic Drift). Being in the rain shadow of the North Pennines, it is among the driest cities in the UK. Temperature extremes recorded at Newcastle Weather Centre include 32.5 °C (90.5 °F) during August 1990 down to −12.6 °C (9.3 °F) during January 1982. In contrast to other areas influenced by the Gulf Stream, such as inland Scandinavia, Newcastle has milder winters and cooler summers, similar to the remainder of the British Isles.</h2><h3>What's the climate like in Newcastle?</h3><p>oceanic</p><p>oceanic</p><p>significantly milder than some other locations</p><h3>What kind of influence does the Gulf Stream exert on Newcastle?</h3><p>warming</p><p>warming</p><p>warming influence</p><h3>What type of shadow does the North Pennines cast?</h3><p>rain</p><p>rain</p><p>the rain shadow</p><h3>When was the coldest temperature in Newcastle recorded?</h3><p>January 1982</p><p>1982</p><p>−12.6 °C (9.3 °F)</p><h3>What area is Newcastle's milder winters and cooler summers most similar to?</h3><p>the British Isles</p><p>the British Isles</p><p>the remainder of the British Isles</p><h2>In 2010, Newcastle was positioned ninth in the retail centre expenditure league of the UK. There are several major shopping areas in Newcastle City Centre. The largest of these is the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, one of the largest city centre shopping complexes in the UK. It incorporates a flagship Debenhams store as well as one of the largest John Lewis stores in the UK. John Lewis is still known to many in Newcastle as Bainbridges. Newcastle store Bainbridge's, opened in 1838, is often cited as the world’s first department store. Emerson Bainbridge (1817–1892), a pioneer and the founder of Bainbridges, sold goods via department, a new for merchant custom for that time. The Bainbridge’s official ledgers reported revenue by department, giving birth to the name department store. Eldon Square is currently undergoing a full redevelopment. A new bus station, replacing the old underground bus station, was officially opened in March 2007. The wing of the centre, including the undercover Green Market, near Grainger Street was demolished in 2007 so that the area could be redeveloped. This was completed in February 2010 with the opening of a flagship Debenhams department store as well as other major stores including Apple, Hollister and Guess.</h2><h3>What year was Newcastle ninth in retail expenditures?</h3><p>2010</p><p>2010</p><p>In 2010</p><h3>What is one of the largest city center shopping complexes in the UK?</h3><p>Eldon Square Shopping Centre,</p><p>the Eldon Square Shopping Centre</p><p>the Eldon Square Shopping Centre</p><h3>What department store is thought to be the first in the world?</h3><p>Bainbridge's</p><p>Bainbridge's</p><p>Bainbridges</p><h3>How did Brainbridge's official ledgers report revenue?</h3><p>by department</p><p>by department</p><p>by department,</p><h3>What year was the new bus station in Newcastle officially opened?</h3><p>2007</p><p>2007</p><p>2007</p><h2>Other shopping destinations in Newcastle include Grainger Street and the area around Grey's Monument, the relatively modern Eldon Garden and Monument Mall complexes, the Newgate Centre, Central Arcade and the traditional Grainger Market.

The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule. This language was the forerunner of Modern English; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages—particularly Latin and Norman French—the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language. An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words: &quot;dead&quot;, &quot;cow&quot;, &quot;house&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; are pronounced &quot;deed&quot;, &quot;coo&quot;, &quot;hoos&quot; and &quot;strang&quot;—which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language. Other Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins include: &quot;larn&quot; (from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;laeran&quot;, meaning &quot;teach&quot;), &quot;burn&quot; (&quot;stream&quot;) and &quot;gan&quot; (&quot;go&quot;).</h2><h3>What is the dialect of Newcastle known as?</h3><p>Geordie</p><p>Geordie</p><p>Geordie,</p><h3>Who conquered much of England after the end of Roman imperial rule?</h3><p>Anglo-Saxon populations</p><p>Anglo-Saxon populations</p><p>the Anglo-Saxon populations</p><h3>What does the Geordie dialect keep of the older language which came before it?</h3><p>many elements</p><p>many elements</p><p>many elements of the old language.</p><h3>Strang is an Anglo-Saxon word which means what in modern English?</h3><p>strong</p><p>strang</p><p>strong</p><h3>Would word means burn in the Anglo-Saxon language?</h3><p>stream</p><p>stream</p><p>stream</p><h2>&quot;Bairn&quot; and &quot;hyem&quot;, meaning &quot;child&quot; and &quot;home&quot;, respectively, are examples of Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia; barn and hjem are the corresponding modern Norwegian and Danish words. Some words used in the Geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the Northern United Kingdom. The words &quot;bonny&quot; (meaning &quot;pretty&quot;), &quot;howay&quot; (&quot;come on&quot;), &quot;stot&quot; (&quot;bounce&quot;) and &quot;hadaway&quot; (&quot;go away&quot; or &quot;you're kidding&quot;), all appear to be used in Scots; &quot;aye&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;) and &quot;nowt&quot; (IPA://naʊt/, rhymes with out,&quot;nothing&quot;) are used elsewhere in Northern England. Many words, however, appear to be used exclusively in Newcastle and the surrounding area, such as &quot;Canny&quot; (a versatile word meaning &quot;good&quot;, &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;very&quot;), &quot;hacky&quot; (&quot;dirty&quot;), &quot;netty&quot; (&quot;toilet&quot;), &quot;hoy&quot; (&quot;throw&quot;, from the Dutch gooien, via West Frisian), &quot;hockle&quot; (&quot;spit&quot;).</h2><h3>&quot;Bairn&quot; and &quot;hyem&quot; have origins from what culture?</h3><p>Scandinavia</p><p>Scandinavia</p><p>Scandinavia</p><h3>Where are some words from the Geordia dialect used?</h3><p>Northern United Kingdom</p><p>elsewhere in the Northern United Kingdom</p><p>the Northern United Kingdom</p><h3>What folks are likely to use words like &quot;howay&quot; and &quot;hadaway&quot;?</h3><p>Scots</p><p>Scots</p><p>Scots</p><h3>What appears to be used exclusively in Newcastle and surrounding areas?</h3><p>Many words</p><p>Many words</p><p>Canny</p><h3>What language does &quot;hoy&quot; originate from?</h3><p>Dutch</p><p>Dutch</p><p>the Dutch gooien</p><h2>In a report, published in early February 2007 by the Ear Institute at the University College London, and Widex, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer, Newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the whole of the UK, with an average level of 80.4 decibels.

It was opened in five phases between 1980 and 1984, and was Britain's first urban light rail transit system; two extensions were opened in 1991 and 2002. It was developed from a combination of existing and newly built tracks and stations, with deep-level tunnels constructed through Newcastle city centre. A bridge was built across the Tyne, between Newcastle and Gateshead, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. The network is operated by DB Regio on behalf of Nexus and carries over 37 million passengers a year, extending as far as Newcastle Airport, Tynemouth, South Shields and South Hylton in Sunderland. In 2004, the company Marconi designed and constructed the mobile radio system to the underground Metro system.

The present building was begun in the 12th Century and the last addition to it, apart from the vestries, was the main porch in 1726. It is quite possible that there was an earlier church here dating from Saxon times. This older church would have been one of several churches along the River Tyne dedicated to St Andrew, including the Priory church at Hexham. The building contains more old stonework than any other church in Newcastle. It is surrounded by the last of the ancient churchyards to retain its original character. Many key names associated with Newcastle's history worshipped and were buried here. The church tower received a battering during the Siege of Newcastle by the Scots who finally breached the Town Wall and forced surrender. Three of the cannonballs remain on site as testament to the siege.</h2><h3>Which parish church in Newcastle is typically agreed to be the oldest one in town?</h3><p>The Parish Church of St Andrew</p><p>The Parish Church of St Andrew</p><p>The Parish Church of St Andrew is</p><h3>What year was the latest addition to the Church of St. Andrew?</h3><p>1726</p><p>1726</p><p>1726</p><h3>What was added to the the church of St. Andrew in 1726?</h3><p>the main porch</p><p>the main porch</p><p>the main porch</p><h3>What surrounds the church of St. Andrew?</h3><p>ancient churchyards</p><p>ancient churchyards</p><p>ancient churchyards</p><h3>What received a battering during the Siege of Newcastle?</h3><p>The church tower</p><p>The church tower</p><p>The church tower</p><h2>ITV Tyne Tees was based at City Road for over 40 years after its launch in January 1959.
