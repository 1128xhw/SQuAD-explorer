Due to his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power. In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the Mongols. However, Jamukha, threatened by Temüjin's rapid ascent, quickly moved to stop Temüjin's ambitions. In 1187, he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops. Temüjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack, but he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut. Jamukha horrified people greatly and harmed his image by boiling seventy young male captives alive in cauldrons, alienating many of his potential followers and eliciting sympathy for Temüjin. Toghrul, as Temüjin's patron, was exiled to the Qara Khitai. The life of Temüjin for the next ten years is very unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Jamukha support that were not part of Temüjin's power base?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the traditional Mongolian aristocracy</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> traditional Mongolian aristocracy</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> the traditional Mongolian aristocracy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which shaman's proclamation aided Temüjin's rise? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kokochu</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Kokochu </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Kokochu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Temüjin elected khan of the Mongols?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1186</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">1186</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">1186</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which battle did Temüjin lose to Jamukha shortly after his election as khan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Dalan Balzhut</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Dalan Balzhut</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> 1187</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Temüjin's patron Toghrul exiled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qara Khitai</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Qara Khitai</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Qara Khitai.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As an incentive for absolute obedience and following his rule of law, the Yassa code, Temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils.

Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty.

Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed Ögedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of the Khwarezmian dynasty in the early 1200s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ordered the attack on the caravan of traders Genghis Khan send to Khwarezmia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Inalchuq</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Inalchuq</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Inalchuq</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Genghis Khan's ambassadors did the Shah have beheaded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Muslim</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Muslim</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">he Muslim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many soldiers did Genghis Khan take with him to Khwarezmia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100,000 </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">100,000</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">100,000 soldiers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trading route joined Khwarezmia and the Mongol Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Silk Road</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Silk Road</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Silk Road</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the Tien Shan mountains by entering the area controlled by the Khwarezmian Empire.

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including Mstislav III of Kiev, were put under this platform and crushed to death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Khwarezmian Empire fall to Genghis Khan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1220</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">1220</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">1220,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose plan called for the Mongolian army to split in two after the Khwarezmian conquest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Subutai</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Subutai</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Subutai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Jebe and Subutai spend the winter following the split of the Mongol army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">near the Black Sea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Black Sea</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Russia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Kievian force that confronted Subutai's army defeated in 1223?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kalka River</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> Kalka River</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Kalka River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Kievian Rus' troops against Subutai's Mongol army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for conquest of Hungary and Europe. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added Transoxiana and Persia to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson Batu and the Golden Horde, the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Mongol leader completed the conquest of Kievan Rus'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Batu</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Batu</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Genghis Khan's grandson Batu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what name was the Mongol army that finally conquered Bulgaria known?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Golden Horde</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Golden Horde</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">the Golden Horde</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two Mongol leaders added Persia to the Mongol Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Subutai and Jebe</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Subutai and Jebe</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Subutai and Jebe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Subutai's army return to Mongolia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1225</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">1225 </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">1225</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Jebe die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on the road back to Samarkand</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">on the road back to Samarkand</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">the road back to Samarkand</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts.

One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near Helan Mountains but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid siege to the Tangut city Lingzhou and crossed the Yellow River, defeating the Tangut relief army.

At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to Liupanshan (Qingshui County, Gansu Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after.

According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In The Secret History of the Mongols, just before the invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor.

He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. Tolui, Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to Ögedei. Ögedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which pair of Genghis Khan's sons were most rivalrous?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chagatai and Jochi</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Chagatai and Jochi</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Chagatai and Jochi)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Genghis Khan's sons was disqualified from being successor because of his unstable behavior?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chagatai</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Chagatai </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Chagatai </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which's of Genghis Khan's successors could not be successor because of his age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tolui</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Tolui</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Tolui,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which son did Genghis Khan view as his most dependable one?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ögedei</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Ögedei </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> Ögedei</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in Khorasan. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of Urgench. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: &quot;Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.&quot; Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jochi's death occurred in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1226</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">1226</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">1226</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Jochi remain after Genghis Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Khorasan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Khorasan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Khorasan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which territory did Jochi try to protect that may have led to a dispute with his brothers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Urgench</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Urgench</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> Urgench</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Jochi reportedly enlist to help him stop his father's massacres? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sultan Muhammad</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Sultan Muhammad</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Sultan Muhammad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is Jochi's reported alliance with the Muslims historically suspect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In August 1227, during the fall of Yinchuan, the capital of Western Xia, Genghis Khan died. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the Western Xia, illness, falling from his horse, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle. According to The Secret History of the Mongols Genghis Khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury. He was already old and tired from his journeys. The Galician–Volhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign. Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis' death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty. One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Genghis Khan was in the process of taking what capital city when he died?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yinchuan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Yinchuan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Yinchuan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Secret History say Genghis Khan was doing when he sustained his mortal injuries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hunting</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">hunting </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> hunting </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What weapon did Marco Pole report as the cause of Genghis Khan's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arrow</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">arrow </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">arrow wound </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Later chronicles of Genghis Khan's death implicate a princess from what empire in his death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western Xia</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> Western Xia</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> Western Xia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which rival of the Mongols is suspected of inventing the story that Genghis Khan was murdered by a captured princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oirads</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Oirads</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Oirads</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Years before his death, Genghis Khan asked to be buried without markings, according to the customs of his tribe.

It was taken through Communist-held territory in Yan'an some 900 km on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years. In 1949, as Communist troops advanced, the Nationalist soldiers moved it another 200 km farther west to the famous Tibetan monastery of Kumbum Monastery or Ta'er Shi near Xining, which soon fell under Communist control. In early 1954, Genghis Khan's bier and relics were returned to the Lord's Enclosure in Mongolia. By 1956 a new temple was erected there to house them.

The &quot;relics&quot; were remade in the 1970s and a great marble statue of Genghis was completed in 1989.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Mongolian name for the original place of the Genghis Khan mausoleum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edsen Khoroo</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Edsen Khoroo</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Edsen Khoroo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Buddhist monastery hosted the Genghis Khan mausoleum during the Japanese occupation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dongshan Dafo Dian</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Dongshan Dafo Dian</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">the Dongshan Dafo Dian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Chinese Nationalists move the mausoleum away from advancing Chinese Communist forces? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kumbum Monastery or Ta'er Shi near Xining</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> Kumbum Monastery</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Tibetan monastery of Kumbum Monastery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the mausoleum returned to the Lord's Enclosure in Mongolia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1954</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">1954</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">1954,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who destroyed the most valuable relics in the mausoleum during the Cultural Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Red Guards</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Red Guards</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">1968</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On October 6, 2004, a joint Japanese-Mongolian archaeological dig uncovered what is believed to be Genghis Khan's palace in rural Mongolia, which raises the possibility of actually locating the ruler's long-lost burial site.

Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply.

Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What recent decade saw brightening of the perception of Genghis Khan in Mongolia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">1990s </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the key accomplishment of Genghis Khan that modern Mongolians celebrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">uniting warring tribes</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">uniting warring tribes</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">uniting warring tribes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do Mongolians sometime describe their relationship to Genghis Khan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genghis Khan's children</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Genghis Khan's children</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">father of the Mongols</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some Mongolians feel non-Mongolian historians exaggerate about Genghis Khan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his brutality</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">butchery </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> his butchery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the general perception of non-Mongolian histories of Genghis Khan by Mongolians themselves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unfairly biased</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">unfairly biased</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">his positive role is underrated</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness are endorsed on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. &quot;Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,&quot; Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. &quot;Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,&quot; Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Mongolian name of the first Mongolian laws codified in writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ikh Zasag</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> Ikh Zasag (</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> Ikh Zasag </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Mongolian President Tsakhiagian Elbegdorj note was significantly punished by Genghis Khan's laws?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">corruption and bribery</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">corruption and bribery</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">corruption and bribery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Mongolian president lauded Genghis Khan on the 850th anniversary of the conqueror's birth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Elbegdorj</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What innovation in Mongolian language is credited to Genghis Khan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">traditional Mongolian script</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> traditional Mongolian script</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> traditional Mongolian script</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are conflicting views of Genghis Khan in the People's Republic of China with some viewing him positively in the Inner Mongolia region where there are a monument and buildings about him and where there is a considerable number of Mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million, almost twice the population of Mongolia. While Genghis Khan never conquered all of China, his grandson Kublai Khan completed that conquest and established the Yuan dynasty that is often credited with re-uniting China. There has been much artwork and literature praising Genghis as a great military leader and political genius. The years of the Mongol-established Yuan dynasty left an indelible imprint on Chinese political and social structures for subsequent generations with literature during the Jin dynasty relatively fewer. In general the legacy of Genghis Khan and his successors, who completed the conquest of China after 65 years of struggle, remains a mixed topic.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in China is Genghis Khan most favorably viewed today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Inner Mongolia region</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> Inner Mongolia region</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> Inner Mongolia region </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the population of the Inner Mongolia region of China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 million</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">around 5 million</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">around 5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which descendant of Genghis Khan is remembered as having reunified China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> Kublai Khan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Chinese dynasty did the Mongols found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yuan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer"> Yuan</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Yuan dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Kublai Khan's relation to Genghis Khan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grandson</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">grandson </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> grandson</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Middle East, and particularly in Iran, Genghis Khan is almost universally condemned as a destructive and genocidal warlord who caused enormous damage and destruction to the population of these areas.
