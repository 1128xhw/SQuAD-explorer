Understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of teaching styles. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly. For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: &quot;The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all. This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would a teacher assess the levels of a student on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">particular skills</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">educational</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">particular skills</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what areas does most of the learning take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self-study and problem solving</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">classroom</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">in self-study and problem solving</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would a teacher do for someone who is timid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">encourage</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">encourage</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">encourage </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would a teacher do for someone who is cocky?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deflate</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">deflate</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">deflate </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What function is a teacher's role similar to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a coach</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">coach</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">coach </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children.

The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning. Also, enthusiasm may act as a &quot;motivational embellishment&quot;; increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material.

Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior.

If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell. They also must enjoy being around their students. A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching. For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well.

Teaching certification generally lasts three years, but teachers can receive certificates that last as long as ten years. Public school teachers are required to have a bachelor's degree and the majority must be certified by the state in which they teach. Many charter schools do not require that their teachers be certified, provided they meet the standards to be highly qualified as set by No Child Left Behind. Additionally, the requirements for substitute/temporary teachers are generally not as rigorous as those for full-time professionals.

However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school. Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In general, what were teachers paid in the past?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relatively low salaries</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">relatively low salaries</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">relatively low salaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been getting much better in the most recent years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">average teacher salaries</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">average teacher salaries</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">teacher salaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two factors can generally increase a teacher's salary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more experience and higher education</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">more experience and higher education </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">more experience and higher education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In a report on K-12 teachers, which teachers had the lowest median salary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elementary school teachers</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">elementary school teachers </span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">preschool teachers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What website are teachers using to sell their lesson plans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">TeachersPayTeachers.com</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">TeachersPayTeachers.com</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">TeachersPayTeachers.com</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in Christianity, across all three major traditions - (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational, with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical Christian traditions with a long tradition of &quot;discernment of spirits&quot;, of vocations, and other aspects of spiritual life, especially the Roman and Orthodox Catholic Churches. These positions include: the honoured but informal position of starets or elder - a man (or, less often, woman), often a monastic, considered to be graced by God with certain gifts for the guidance of souls and the detection and correction of prelest (spiritual pride or deception) - who acts as a spiritual guide or father in the Orthodox Catholic tradition, especially Russian Orthodoxy (see Optina Monastery, which had a long line of said starets); the Priest or Confessor in Roman Catholicism, who is often a man in Holy Orders but may be a monastic or other person respected for his spiritual accomplishments or acumen (even the Pope of Rome has a Confessor, who is not always a bishop, and, due to the hierarchical structure of the Roman Church, can not be his equal in authority), which is often a semi-official to official position, as opposed to the unofficial positions of spiritual guides in the Orthodox Catholic and Protestant traditions; and the almost-exclusively informal arrangements (generally formal only in members who are under some form of church discipline) of mentorship (both of adults and children, in the latter case often a youth pastor) in the Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions, which boundaries can be blurred with the more typically Roman &quot;confessor&quot; position in some of the more historic and conservative Reformation Churches, such as some of the Lutheran and Anglican. In keeping with the individualistic nature of most Protestant denominations, the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is small, with a heavy emphasis placed on heavy reading and personal, Spirit-enlightened interpretation of the Holy Bible.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many types of religious or spiritual teachers are there in Christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">many</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">many </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which denomination has more of an individualistic streak?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestant</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">Protestant</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer">Protestant </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is the Pope's confessor a Bishop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not always</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">not always</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the three major traditions present in Christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">(Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 2: </i><span class="answer">(Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational</span></p></li><li><p><i>Answer 3: </i><span class="answer"> (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the teacher is an office in the Aaronic priesthood, generally conferred on young boys or recent converts, and has little in common with the &quot;spiritual teacher&quot; archetype. The role of &quot;spiritual teacher&quot; may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all. The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more &quot;low-church&quot; traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders.
