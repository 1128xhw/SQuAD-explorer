Another theory holds that the island found by da Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, 2,430 kilometres (1,510 mi) to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships attached to the squadron of Estêvão da Gama expedition on 30 July 1503 (as reported in the account of clerk Thomé Lopes). However, a paper published in 2015 reviewed the discovery date and dismissed the 18 August as too late for da Nova to make a discovery and then return to Lisbon by 11 September 1502, whether he sailed from St Helena or Tristan da Cunha. It demonstrates the 21 May is probably a Protestant rather than Catholic or Orthodox feast-day, first quoted in 1596 by Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, who was probably mistaken because the island was discovered several decades before the Reformation and start of Protestantism. The alternative discovery date of 3 May, the Catholic feast-day for the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, quoted by Odoardo Duarte Lopes and Sir Thomas Herbert is suggested as being historically more credible.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date was the island discovered on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21 May 1502</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What navigator discovered the island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">João da Nova</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country was João da Nova doing service for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portugal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What person is Saint Helena Island named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Helena of Constantinople</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Portuguese found the island uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water.

In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island. The Portuguese and Spanish soon gave up regularly calling at the island, partly because they used ports along the West African coast, but also because of attacks on their shipping, the desecration of their chapel and religious icons, destruction of their livestock and destruction of plantations by Dutch and English sailors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who probably located the island on their final leg of their circumnavigation trip?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Englishman Sir Francis Drake</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did English ships of war attack on the island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portuguese India carracks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed a far east trade and began to frequent the island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dutch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave up calling at the island due to attacks on their shipping?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Portuguese and Spanish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Dutch Republic formally made claim to Saint Helena in 1633, although there is no evidence that they ever occupied, colonised or fortified it.

The latter half of the 19th century saw the advent of steam ships not reliant on trade winds, as well as the diversion of Far East trade away from the traditional South Atlantic shipping lanes to a route via the Red Sea (which, prior to the building of the Suez Canal, involved a short overland section).

Coastal areas are covered in volcanic rock and warmer and drier than the centre. The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak at 818 m (2,684 ft). In 1996 it became the island's first national park. Much of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are some original trees augmented by plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project which was established in 2002 to replant part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. When the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species. The island's hinterland must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably also quite green. The modern landscape is very different, with widespread bare rock in the lower areas, although inland it is green, mainly due to introduced vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep have been introduced, and native species have been adversely affected as a result.

There were no plans to land the cable and install a landing station ashore, which could supply St Helena's population with sufficient bandwidth to fully leverage the benefits of today's Information Society. In January 2012, a group of supporters petitioned the UK government to meet the cost of landing the cable at St Helena. On 6 October 2012, eFive agreed to reroute the cable through St. Helena after a successful lobbying campaign by A Human Right, a San Francisco-based NGA working on initiatives to ensure all people are connected to the Internet. Islanders have sought the assistance of the UK Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office in funding the £10m required to bridge the connection from a local junction box on the cable to the island. The UK Government have announced that a review of the island's economy would be required before such funding would be agreed to.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is the South Atlantic Express in miles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6,214</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who runs the South Atlantic Express?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eFive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did eFive announce they would reroute the cable through Saint Helena?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 October 2012</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who lobbied for the cable reroute into South Helena?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Human Right</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The island has two local newspapers, both of which are available on the Internet.
