Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States, who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitution in 1787. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C., was under construction. In the 19th century, Philadelphia became a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of European immigrants. It became a prime destination for African-Americans in the Great Migration and surpassed two million occupants by 1950.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Philadelphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Penn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What role did Philadelphia play in the American Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a meeting place for the Founding Fathers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What purpose did Philadelphia serve while D.C. was under construction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">temporary U.S. capital</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did it reach 2 million occupants&gt;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Based on the similar shifts underway the nation's economy after 1960, Philadelphia experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions of the USA and often overseas. As a result, the economic base of Philadelphia, which had historically been manufacturing, declined significantly. In addition, consolidation in several American industries (retailing, financial services and health care in particular) reduced the number of companies headquartered in Philadelphia. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes, coupled with significant demographic change as wealthier residents moved into the nearby suburbs and more immigrants moved into the city. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s. Revitalization began in the 1990s, with gentrification turning around many neighborhoods and reversing its decades-long trend of population loss.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the historical economic base of Philadelphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">manufacturing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the city near bankruptcy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did wealthy residents move?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">suburbs </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced the wealthy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">immigrants </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The area's many universities and colleges make Philadelphia a top international study destination, as the city has evolved into an educational and economic hub. With a gross domestic product of $388 billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation. Philadelphia is the center of economic activity in Pennsylvania and is home to seven Fortune 1000 companies. The Philadelphia skyline is growing, with several nationally prominent skyscrapers. The city is known for its arts, culture, and history, attracting over 39 million domestic tourists in 2013. Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city, and Fairmount Park is the largest landscaped urban park in the world. The 67 National Historic Landmarks in the city helped account for the $10 billion generated by tourism. Philadelphia is the birthplace of the United States Marine Corps, and is also the home of many U.S. firsts, including the first library (1731), first hospital (1751) and medical school (1765), first Capitol (1777), first stock exchange (1790), first zoo (1874), and first business school (1881).

The Lenape are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government. They are also called Delaware Indians and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and violent conflict with Europeans. Iroquois people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in the US state of Oklahoma, with some communities living also in Wisconsin, Ontario (Canada) and in their traditional homelands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What native American tribe lived in the area before settlement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lenape </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other tribe occasionally fought against the Lenape?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iroquois </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What disease killed the most Lenape?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">smallpox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Lenape go after being pushed out of the Philidelphia area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">upper Ohio River basin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do the Lenape reside today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oklahoma</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Europeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River opposite the Schuylkill River in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina (present day Wilmington, Delaware) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their military defeat of the English colony of Maryland. In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm, named New Korsholm after a town that is now in Finland. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence, although the Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, but the situation did not really change until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the first settlers to the Delaware Valley?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dutch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first settlement in the area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fort Nassau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who claimed the entire Delaware River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he Dutch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the English conquer the New Netherland colony?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1664</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted William Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony. Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown section. Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for brotherly love (from philos, &quot;love&quot; or &quot;friendship&quot;, and adelphos, &quot;brother&quot;). As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city. Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the port, and subdivided and resold their lots. Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. It became an important trading center, poor at first, but with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Pennsylvania colony?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Penn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Penn buy the land from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lenape </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did William Penn practice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quaker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Philadelphia established as a city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1701 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of street layout did Penn use for Philadelphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> grid plan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Philadelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British America, and second in the British Empire, behind London. The city hosted the First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary War; the Second Continental Congress, which signed the United States Declaration of Independence, during the war; and the Constitutional Convention (1787) after the war.

Before 1800, its free black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent black denomination in the country, and the first black Episcopal Church. The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. New York City soon surpassed Philadelphia in population, but with the construction of roads, canals, and railroads, Philadelphia became the first major industrial city in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the US government leave Philadelphia for D.C.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1799</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did the black community found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African Methodist Episcopal Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city surpassed the population of Philadelphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New York City </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of economy did Philadelphia have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">industrial </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Throughout the 19th century, Philadelphia had a variety of industries and businesses, the largest being textiles.

Industry, along with the U.S. Centennial, was celebrated in 1876 with the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's Fair in the United States. Immigrants, mostly Irish and German, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended the city limits of Philadelphia from the 2 square miles of present-day Center City to the roughly 130 square miles of Philadelphia County.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Philadelphia's biggest industry during the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">textiles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first World's Fair?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1876 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which were the two biggest immigrant groups in Philadelphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Irish and German</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the size in square miles today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">130 square miles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street, and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools, and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic Nativist riots had erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. In the latter half of the century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy; and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city. Between 1880 and 1930, the African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559.

In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot of ethnic whites against blacks during Red Summer, in post-World War I unrest, as recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, mob violence, and police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brigadier General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as director of public safety, but political pressure prevented any long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which political party controlled Philadelphia in the early 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Republican </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What phrase could describe Philadelphia of the early 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">corrupt and contented</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the first major political reform occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1917 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.

In addition, suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s.

The Delaware River and Schuylkill Rivers served as early boundaries between which the city's early street plan was kept within. In addition, Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824 (in parenthesis): Centre Square, North East Publick Square (Franklin Square), Northwest Square (Logan Square), Southwest Square (Rittenhouse Square), and Southeast Square (Washington Square).

Renovations were made to Sister Cities Park in mid-2011 and on May 10, 2012, SCP was reopened and currently features an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's ten sister and friendship cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city in Poland is a sister city to Philadelphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Toruń</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city in Israel is a sister city to Philadelphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tel Aviv </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Torun triangle built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1976</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else does the Triangle contain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Copernicus monument</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many sister cities does Philadelphia have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ten </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
