The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the Paris Pacts of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year was the Warsaw Pact established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1955</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which nation formed the nucleus of the Warsaw Pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which conflict was the impetus for the formation of the Pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Cold War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Soviet allied countries were members of the Warsaw Pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The acceptance of which country into NATO prompted the formation of the Warsaw Pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">West Germany</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the Warsaw Pact was established as a balance of power or counterweight to NATO, there was no direct confrontation between them.

The Warsaw Pact's largest military engagement was Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia (with the participation of all Pact nations except Romania and Albania). The Pact failed to function when the Revolutions of 1989 spread through Eastern Europe, beginning with the Solidarity movement in Poland and its success in June 1989.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which organization was in direct competition with the Warsaw Pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">NATO</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which nation saw the most significant Warsaw Pact military deployment? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Czechoslovakia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Polish revolutionary movement which the Warsaw Pact failed to suppress?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Solidarity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country saw the largest Warsaw Pact deployment? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Czechoslovakia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the Warsaw Pact cease to function effectively? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1989</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Polish labor movement which successfully defied the Warsaw Pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Solidarity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 25 February 1991, the Pact was declared at an end at a meeting of defense and foreign ministers from the remaining member states meeting in Hungary.

This policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons. Ideologically, the Soviet Union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement. A corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and Communist Party functions, which was explicitly stated in the Brezhnev Doctrine. Geostrategic principles also drove the Soviet Union to prevent invasion of its territory by Western European powers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ideologies did the Soviet Union aspire to lead around the globe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">socialism and communism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Soviet leader formed doctrine aimed at keeping socialist satellite nations in line?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brezhnev</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Soviet Union feared invasion from which potential enemy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western Europe</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before creation of Warsaw Pact, fearing Germany rearmed, Czechoslovak leadership sought to create security pact with East Germany and Poland. These states protested strongly against re-militarization of West Germany. The Warsaw Pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of West Germany inside NATO. Soviet leaders, as many European countries in both western and eastern side, feared Germany being once again a military power as a direct threat and German militarism remained a fresh memory among Soviets and Eastern Europeans. As Soviet Union had already bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites, the Pact has been long considered 'superfluous', and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived, NATO officials labeled it as a 'cardboard castle'. Previously, in March 1954, the USSR, fearing the restoration of German Militarism in West Germany, requested admission to NATO.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by fears of which country rearming itself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">West Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country sought NATO admission in response to the fear of German rearmament?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the USSR</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of January–February 1954. Soviet foreign minister Molotov made proposals to have Germany reunified and elections for a pan-German government, under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers armies and German neutrality, but all were refused by the other foreign ministers, Dulles (USA), Eden (UK) and Bidault (France). Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March 1952, talks about a German reunification, initiated by the socalled 'Stalin Note', ended after the United Kingdom, France, and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm. James Dunn (USA), who met in Paris with Eden, Adenauer and Robert Schuman (France), affirmed that &quot;the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community&quot;. According to John Gaddis &quot;there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer&quot; from USSR. While historian Rolf Steininger asserts that Adenauer's conviction that “neutralization means sovietization” was the main factor in the rejection of the soviet proposals, Adenauer also feared that unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU's dominance in the Bundestag.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Soviet minister who proposed German reunification?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Molotov</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was reunification first proposed as an idea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1952</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One month later, the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the EDC but also by western opponents of the European Defense Community (like French Gaullist leader Palewski) who perceived it as &quot;unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe&quot;. The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the USA, UK and France stating to accept the participation of the USA in the proposed General European Agreement. And considering that another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by western powers as &quot;directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation&quot;, the Soviets decided to declare their &quot;readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc&quot;, specifying that &quot;the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The omission of which nation from involvement in the proposed security system led to its NATO opposition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the USA</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Again all proposals, including the request to join NATO, were rejected by UK, US, and French governments shortly after.

Doctrinally, as a Soviet-style (offensive) battle plan, Seven Days to the River Rhine gave commanders few defensive-war strategies for fighting NATO in Warsaw Treaty territory.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did Poland declassify most of its Warsaw Pact-era archives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many documents remain classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Warsaw Pact's planned counteroffensive to a NATO first strike?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Seven Days to the River Rhine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many nuclear weapons were eventually housed in Poland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">250</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year was the counteroffensive strategy first conceived?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1979</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
