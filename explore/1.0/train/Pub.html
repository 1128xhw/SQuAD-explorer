After the departure of Roman authority in the 5th Century and the fall of the Romano-British kingdoms, the Anglo-Saxons established alehouses that grew out of domestic dwellings, the Anglo-Saxon alewife would put a green bush up on a pole to let people know her brew was ready. These alehouses quickly evolved into meeting houses for the folk to socially congregate, gossip and arrange mutual help within their communities. Herein lies the origin of the modern public house, or &quot;Pub&quot; as it is colloquially called in England. They rapidly spread across the Kingdom, becoming so commonplace that in 965 King Edgar decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the inhabitants of the British Isles begin drinking ale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Bronze Age</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With the Roman road network, what were the first inns called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tabernae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the alewife let people know that her brew was ready?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Anglo-Saxon alewife would put a green bush up on a pole</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did King Edgar decree in 965?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">there should be no more than one alehouse per village</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what historical epoch did Britons begin drinking ale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Bronze Age</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Romans arrive in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1st Century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Latin term for the Roman inns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tabernae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Romans leave Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5th Century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What color bush did an Anglo-Saxon woman raise to indicate that her ale was done brewing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">green </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A traveller in the early Middle Ages could obtain overnight accommodation in monasteries, but later a demand for hostelries grew with the popularity of pilgrimages and travel.

Famous London inns include The George, Southwark and The Tabard. There is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment.

Gin was brought to England by the Dutch after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and became very popular after the government created a market for &quot;cuckoo grain&quot; or &quot;cuckoo malt&quot; that was unfit to be used in brewing and distilling by allowing unlicensed gin and beer production, while imposing a heavy duty on all imported spirits. As thousands of gin-shops sprang up all over England, brewers fought back by increasing the number of alehouses. By 1740 the production of gin had increased to six times that of beer and because of its cheapness it became popular with the poor, leading to the so-called Gin Craze. Over half of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London were gin shops.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After what political upheaval was gin introduced to England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Glorious Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What people introduced gin to England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dutch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Glorious Revolution occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1688</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much more gin than beer was made in England in 1740?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1740, what fraction of London drinking establishments were gin shops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">half</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The drunkenness and lawlessness created by gin was seen to lead to ruination and degradation of the working classes.

Even the evangelical church and temperance movements of the day viewed the drinking of beer very much as a secondary evil and a normal accompaniment to a meal.

Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels on a table in the corner of the room.

Licences were only granted, transferred or renewed at special Licensing Sessions courts, and were limited to respectable individuals. Often these were ex-servicemen or ex-policemen; retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service. Licence conditions varied widely, according to local practice. They would specify permitted hours, which might require Sunday closing, or conversely permit all-night opening near a market. Typically they might require opening throughout the permitted hours, and the provision of food or lavatories. Once obtained, licences were jealously protected by the licensees (who were expected to be generally present, not an absentee owner or company), and even &quot;Occasional Licences&quot; to serve drinks at temporary premises such as fêtes would usually be granted only to existing licensees.

Patrons may put money behind the bar before official closing time, and redeem their drinks during the lock-in so no drinks are technically sold after closing time. The origin of the British lock-in was a reaction to 1915 changes in the licensing laws in England and Wales, which curtailed opening hours to stop factory workers from turning up drunk and harming the war effort. Since 1915, the UK licensing laws had changed very little, with comparatively early closing times. The tradition of the lock-in therefore remained. Since the implementation of Licensing Act 2003, premises in England and Wales may apply to extend their opening hours beyond 11 pm, allowing round-the-clock drinking and removing much of the need for lock-ins. Since the smoking ban, some establishments operated a lock-in during which the remaining patrons could smoke without repercussions but, unlike drinking lock-ins, allowing smoking in a pub was still a prosecutable offence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when the owner of a pub allows patrons to remain when the pub should have closed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;lock-in&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What law allows pubs to apply to extend their closing hours after 11pm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Licensing Act 2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A law of what year prompted the existence of the &quot;lock-in&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1915 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What action by a pub owner can result in his prosecution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allowing smoking</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In March 2006, a law was introduced to forbid smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland. Wales followed suit in April 2007, with England introducing the ban in July 2007. Pub landlords had raised concerns prior to the implementation of the law that a smoking ban would have a negative impact on sales. After two years, the impact of the ban was mixed; some pubs suffered declining sales, while others developed their food sales. The Wetherspoon pub chain reported in June 2009 that profits were at the top end of expectations; however, Scottish &amp; Newcastle's takeover by Carlsberg and Heineken was reported in January 2008 as partly the result of its weakness following falling sales due to the ban.

More common, however, was a card room or a billiard room.[citation needed] The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a higher price of drinks, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed and drinks would be served at the table.[citation needed] From this came the popular music hall form of entertainment—a show consisting of a variety of acts.[citation needed] A most famous London saloon was the Grecian Saloon in The Eagle, City Road, which is still famous because of a nursery rhyme: &quot;Up and down the City Road / In and out The Eagle / That's the way the money goes / Pop goes the weasel.&quot; This meant that the customer had spent all his money at The Eagle, and needed to pawn his &quot;weasel&quot; to get some more.

Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany. A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar[citation needed]. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff. In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the &quot;vault&quot;, other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere. By the early 1970s there was a tendency to change to one large drinking room and breweries were eager to invest in interior design and theming.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Germany, what do servers do to serve beer in beer gardens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bring the beer out to the table</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before the pub, where did beer establishments keep their casks of ale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">taproom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What establishments inspired pubs to set up serving bars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gin houses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what settlement is the pub known as The Vine located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brierley Hill</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the locals call The Vine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Bull and Bladder</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the British engineer and railway builder, introduced the idea of a circular bar into the Swindon station pub in order that customers were served quickly and did not delay his trains.

The landlord of a tied pub may be an employee of the brewery—in which case he/she would be a manager of a managed house, or a self-employed tenant who has entered into a lease agreement with a brewery, a condition of which is the legal obligation (trade tie) only to purchase that brewery's beer. The beer selection is mainly limited to beers brewed by that particular company. The Beer Orders, passed in 1989, were aimed at getting tied houses to offer at least one alternative beer, known as a guest beer, from another brewery. This law has now been repealed but while in force it dramatically altered the industry.

Newly acquired pubs are often renamed by the new owners, and many people resent the loss of traditional names, especially if their favourite regional beer disappears at the same time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When a pub is bought by a new owner, what often happens to them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">renamed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What often happens to regional breweries after they sell their pubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">closed down</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A brewery tap is the nearest outlet for a brewery's beers.

The sets of each of the three major television soap operas have been visited by some of the members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II. The centrepiece of each visit was a trip into the Rovers, the Queen Vic, or the Woolpack to be offered a drink.

Some import British cask ale, rather than beer in kegs, to provide the full British real ale experience to their customers. This newly established Danish interest in British cask beer and the British pub tradition is reflected by the fact that some 56 British cask beers were available at the 2008 European Beer Festival in Copenhagen, which was attended by more than 20,000 people.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What continental European country has pubs that would be familiar to a Briton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Denmark</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many British cask beers were present at the 2008 European Beer Festival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">56 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city did the 2008 European Beer Festival take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Copenhagen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many people visited the 2008 European Beer Festival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Ireland, pubs are known for their atmosphere or &quot;craic&quot;. In Irish, a pub is referred to as teach tábhairne (&quot;tavernhouse&quot;) or teach óil (&quot;drinkinghouse&quot;). Live music, either sessions of traditional Irish music or varieties of modern popular music, is frequently featured in the pubs of Ireland. Pubs in Northern Ireland are largely identical to their counterparts in the Republic of Ireland except for the lack of spirit grocers. A side effect of &quot;The Troubles&quot; was that the lack of a tourist industry meant that a higher proportion of traditional bars have survived the wholesale refitting of Irish pub interiors in the 'English style' in the 1950s and 1960s. New Zealand sports a number of Irish pubs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the native Irish term for a pub's atmosphere?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">craic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does teach tábhairne mean in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tavernhouse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Irish term means &quot;drinkinghouse&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">teach óil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Vis-à-vis pubs in Ireland, what feature do pubs in Northern Ireland lack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spirit grocers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country outside Ireland is known for having Irish pubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Zealand</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most popular term in English-speaking Canada used for a drinking establishment was &quot;tavern&quot;, until the 1970s when the term &quot;bar&quot; became widespread as in the United States. In the 1800s the term used was &quot;public house&quot; as in England but &quot;pub culture&quot; did not spread to Canada. A fake &quot;English looking&quot; pub trend started in the 1990s, built into existing storefronts, like regular bars. Most universities in Canada have campus pubs which are central to student life, as it would be bad form just to serve alcohol to students without providing some type of basic food. Often these pubs are run by the student's union. The gastropub concept has caught on, as traditional British influences are to be found in many Canadian dishes. There are now pubs in the large cities of Canada that cater to anyone interested in a &quot;pub&quot; type drinking environment.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Traditionally, what was the popular term for a drinking establishment in English-speaking Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tavern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade did &quot;bar&quot; become the popular term for a drinking establishment in English-speaking Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 19th century, what term was used in English-speaking Canada to describe a drinking establishment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">public house</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What body often runs pubs on the campuses of Canadian universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the student's union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade could one find an &quot;English looking&quot; pub trend in Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
