Whole sections of the old city, for example the Carmen Quarter, have been extensively renovated.

English soldiers advanced as far as Requena on the road to Madrid. After the victory of the Bourbons at the Battle of Almansa on 25 April 1707, the English army evacuated Valencia and Philip V ordered the repeal of the privileges of Valencia as punishment for the kingdom's support of Charles of Austria. By the Nueva Planta decrees (Decretos de Nueva Planta) the ancient Charters of Valencia were abolished and the city was governed by the Castilian Charter. The Bourbon forces burned important cities like Xativa, where pictures of the Spanish Bourbons in public places are hung upside down as a protest to this day. The capital of the Kingdom of Valencia was moved to Orihuela, an outrage to the citizens of Valencia. Philip ordered the Cortes to meet with the Viceroy of Valencia, Cardinal Luis de Belluga, who opposed the change of capital because of the proximity of Orihuela, a religious, cultural and now political centre, to Murcia (capital of another viceroyalty and his diocese). Because of his hatred of the city of Orihuela, which had bombarded and looted Valencia during the War of Succession, the cardinal resigned the viceroyalty in protest against the actions of Philip, who finally relented and returned the capital to Valencia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the English occupy Valencia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16 months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what battle were the Bourbons victorious?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Almansa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ordered Valencia punished for supporting Charles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What abolished Valencia's ancient charters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nueva Planta decrees</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who resigned in protest against Philip?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cardinal Luis de Belluga</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city remained in the hands of Christian troops until 1102, when the Almoravids retook the city and restored the Muslim religion. Although the self-styled 'Emperor of All Spain', Alfonso VI of León and Castile, drove them from the city, he was not strong enough to hold it. The Christians set it afire before abandoning it, and the Almoravid Masdali took possession on 5 May 1109. The event was commemorated in a poem by Ibn Khafaja in which he thanked Yusuf ibn Tashfin for the city's liberation.The declining power of the Almoravids coincided with the rise of a new dynasty in North Africa, the Almohads, who seized control of the peninsula from the year 1145, although their entry into Valencia was deterred by Ibn Mardanis, King of Valencia and Murcia until 1171, at which time the city finally fell to the North Africans.

Small businesses predominated, but with the rapid mechanisation of industry larger companies were being formed. The best expression of this dynamic was in the regional exhibitions, including that of 1909 held next to the pedestrian avenue L'Albereda (Paseo de la Alameda), which depicted the progress of agriculture and industry.

The financial markets were destabilised, causing a severe economic crisis that led to rationing. A black market in rationed goods existed for over a decade. The Francoist administrations of Valencia silenced publicity of the catastrophic consequences of the floods of 1949 with the attendant dozens of deaths, but could not do the same after the even more tragic flood of 1957 when the river Turia overflowed its banks again, killing many Valencians (officially, eighty-one died; the actual figure is not known). To prevent further disasters, the river was eventually diverted to a new course. The old river bed was abandoned for years, and successive Francoist mayors proposed making it a motorway, but that option was finally rejected with the advent of democracy and fervent neighbourhood protests. The river was divided in two at the western city limits (Plan Sur de Valencia), and diverted southwards along a new course that skirts the city, before meeting the Mediterranean. The old course of the river continues, dry, through the city centre, almost to the sea. The old riverbed is now a verdant sunken park called the 'Garden of the Turia' (Jardí del Túria or Jardín del Turia) that allows cyclists and pedestrians to traverse much of the city without the use of roads; overhead bridges carry motor traffic across the park.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose regime prohibited political parties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Franco</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to official figures, how many died in the flood of 1957?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eighty-one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What river flooded in 1957?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What park is located in the previous river bed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Garden of the Turia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What suggested use for the river bed was rejected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">motorway</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Valencia's port is the biggest on the Mediterranean western coast, the first of Spain in container traffic as of 2008 and the second of Spain in total traffic, handling 20% of Spain's exports.

Small and medium-sized industries are an important part of the local economy, and before the current crisis unemployment was lower than the Spanish average.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Spanish exports does Valencia's port handle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Valencia has the largest port on which coast?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mediterranean western coast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Valencia's port rank among Spanish ports in terms of total traffic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of fruit is exported from Valencia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oranges</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A fervent follower of the absolutist cause, Elío had played an important role in the repression of the supporters of the Constitution of 1812.

The city surrendered on 7 August; Alfonso XII was proclaimed king on 29 December 1874, and arrived in Valencia on 11 January 1875 on his way to Madrid, marking the end of the first republic. Despite the Bourbon restoration, the roughly even balance between conservatives and liberals in the government was sustained in Valencia until the granting of universal male suffrage in 1890, after which the Republicans, led by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, gained considerably more of the popular vote.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the cantonalist uprising occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1873</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was sent to stop Valencia's uprising?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Martinez-Campos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became king in 1874?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alfonso XII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Alfonso XXII reach Valencia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11 January 1875</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Republican leader after the granting of male suffrage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vicente Blasco Ibáñez</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>World-renowned (and city-born) architect Santiago Calatrava produced the futuristic City of Arts and Sciences (Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències), which contains an opera house/performing arts centre, a science museum, an IMAX cinema/planetarium, an oceanographic park and other structures such as a long covered walkway and restaurants.

Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language.
Valencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public life. Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in 1978. However, due to industrialisation in recent decades, Valencia has attracted immigration from other regions in Spain, and hence there is also a demographic factor for its declining social use. Due to a combination of these reasons, Valencia has become the bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, which celebrates Valencian as merely folkloric, but rejects the existing standard which was adapted from Catalan orthography.
Spanish is currently the predominant language in the city proper but, thanks to the education system, most Valencians have basic knowledge of both Spanish and Valencian, and either can be used in the city. Valencia is therefore the second biggest Catalan-speaking city after Barcelona. Institutional buildings and streets are named in Valencian. The city is also home to many pro-Valencian political and civil organisations. Furthermore, education entirely in Valencian is offered in more than 70 state-owned schools in the city, as well as by the University of Valencia across all disciplines.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many official languages does Valencia have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is very similar to Valencian and is considered another variety of the same language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catalan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language is official in Valencia besides Valencian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spanish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many schools offer education completely in Valencian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 70</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Valencian regain its offical status?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1978</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Valencia has experienced a surge in its cultural development during the last thirty years, exemplified by exhibitions and performances at such iconic institutions as the Palau de la Música, the Palacio de Congresos, the Metro, the City of Arts and Sciences (Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències), the Valencian Museum of Enlightenment and Modernity (Museo Valenciano de la Ilustracion y la Modernidad), and the Institute of Modern Art (Instituto Valenciano de Arte Moderno).

With the Byzantine invasion of the southwestern Iberian peninsula in 554 the city acquired strategic importance. After the expulsion of the Byzantines in 625, Visigothic military contingents were posted there and the ancient Roman amphitheatre was fortified. Little is known of its history for nearly a hundred years; although this period is only scarcely documented by archeology, excavations suggest that there was little development of the city.

Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the façade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Paláu. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III.

Some of the most emblematic buildings of the city were built during this period, including the Serranos Towers (1392), the Lonja (1482), the Miguelete and the Chapel of the Kings of the Convent of Santo Domingo. In painting and sculpture, Flemish and Italian trends had an influence on artists such as Lluís Dalmau, Peris Gonçal and Damià Forment. Literature flourished with the patronage of the court of Alfonso the Magnanimous, supporting authors like Ausiàs March, Roiç de Corella, and Isabel de Villena. By 1460 Joanot Martorell wrote Tirant lo Blanch, an innovative novel of chivalry that influenced many later writers, from Cervantes to Shakespeare. Ausiàs March was one of the first poets to use the everyday language Valencian, instead of the troubadour language, Occitan. Also around this time, between 1499 and 1502, the University of Valencia was founded under the parsimonious name of Estudio General (&quot;studium generale&quot;, place of general studies).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Serranos Towers constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1392</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What influential novel did Joanot Martorell write?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tirant lo Blanch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was an early poet to use Valencian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ausiàs March</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the University of Valencia founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> between 1499 and 1502</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the University of Valencia's original name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Estudio General</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The decline of the city reached its nadir with the War of Spanish Succession (1702–1709) that marked the end of the political and legal independence of the Kingdom of Valencia.

Marshal Suchet began a long siege of the city in October 1811, and after intense bombardment forced it to surrender on 8 January 1812. After the capitulation, the French instituted reforms in Valencia, which became the capital of Spain when the Bonapartist pretender to the throne, José I (Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's elder brother), moved the Court there in the summer of 1812.

From 1609 through 1614, the Spanish government systematically forced Moriscos to leave the kingdom for Muslim North Africa. They were concentrated in the former Kingdom of Aragon, where they constituted a fifth of the population, and the Valencia area specifically, where they were roughly a third of the total population. The expulsion caused the financial ruin of some of the nobility and the bankruptcy of the Taula de Canvi in 1613. The Crown endeavoured to compensate the nobles, who had lost much of their agricultural labour force; this harmed the economy of the city for generations to come. Later, during the so-called Catalan Revolt (1640–1652), Valencia contributed to the cause of Philip IV with militias and money, resulting in a period of further economic hardship exacerbated by the arrival of troops from other parts of Spain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What people group was descended from Muslim converts to Christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Moriscos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Jews expelled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1609</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Moriscos go when they were forced out of Spain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What proportion of the Valencia area's population were the Moriscos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Taula de Canvi bankrupted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1613</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the second half of the 19th century the bourgeoisie encouraged the development of the city and its environs; land-owners were enriched by the introduction of the orange crop and the expansion of vineyards and other crops,. This economic boom corresponded with a revival of local traditions and of the Valencian language, which had been ruthlessly suppressed from the time of Philip V. Around 1870, the Valencian Renaissance, a movement committed to the revival of the Valencian language and traditions, began to gain ascendancy. In its early stages the movement inclined to the romanticism of the poet Teodor Llorente, and resisted the more assertive remonstrances of Constantine Llombart, founder of the still extant cultural society, Lo Rat Penat, which is dedicated to the promotion and dissemination of the Valencian language and culture.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who got rich from the Valencian orange crop and vineyards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">land-owners</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had suppressed the Valencian language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group still exists and promotes Valencian culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lo Rat Penat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What poet was an early influence on the Valencian Renaissance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teodor Llorente</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Lo Rat Penat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constantine Llombart</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the regency of Maria Cristina, Espartero ruled Spain for two years as its 18th Prime Minister from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841.

The new century was marked in Valencia with a major event, the Valencian regional exhibition of 1909 (La Exposición Regional Valenciana de 1909), which emulated the national and universal expositions held in other cities.

On 6 November 1936 the city became the capital of Republican Spain under the control of the prime minister Manuel Azana; the government moved to the Palau de Benicarló, its ministries occupying various other buildings. The city was heavily bombarded by air and sea, necessitating the construction of over two hundred bomb shelters to protect the population. On 13 January 1937 the city was first shelled by a vessel of the Fascist Italian Navy, which was blockading the port by the order of Benito Mussolini. The bombardment intensified and inflicted massive destruction on several occasions; by the end of the war the city had survived 442 bombardments, leaving 2,831 dead and 847 wounded, although it is estimated that the death toll was higher, as the data given are those recognised by Francisco Franco's government. The Republican government passed to Juan Negrín on 17 May 1937 and on 31 October of that year moved to Barcelona. On 30 March 1939 Valencia surrendered and the Nationalist troops entered the city. The postwar years were a time of hardship for Valencians. During Franco's regime speaking or teaching Valencian was prohibited; in a significant reversal it is now compulsory for every schoolchild in Valencia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was prime minister in 1936?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manuel Azana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What building did the government move to in 1936?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palau de Benicarló</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bomb shelters were built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over two hundred</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Italian Navy first attack Valencia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13 January 1937</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the government relocate to in 1937?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barcelona</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In March 2012, the newspaper El Mundo published a story according to which FGV had instructed employees who were to testify at the crash commission investigation, providing a set of possible questions and guidelines to prepare the answers.

King Philip IV of Spain and the Duke of Arcos suggested the building of the new chapel, and in 1647 the Viceroy, Conde de Oropesa, who had been preserved from the bubonic plague, insisted on carrying out their project. The Blessed Virgin was proclaimed patroness of the city under the title of Virgen de los desamparados (Virgin of the Forsaken), and Archbishop Pedro de Urbina, on 31 June 1652, laid the cornerstone of the new chapel of this name. The archiepiscopal palace, a grain market in the time of the Moors, is simple in design, with an inside cloister and a handsome chapel.

In 1986, because of its cultural, historical, and ecological value, the Generalitat Valenciana declared it a natural park.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far from Valencia is the Albufera?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11 km</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what park is the Albufera located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parc Natural de l'Albufera</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far from the sea was Valencia when it was founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6.4 km</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Valencia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what entity was the Albufera bought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Crown of Spain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The third largest city in Spain and the 24th most populous municipality in the European Union, Valencia has a population of 809,267 within its administrative limits on a land area of 134.6 km2 (52 sq mi).

The Castilian nobleman Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, who was intent on possessing his own principality on the Mediterranean, entered the province in command of a combined Christian and Moorish army and besieged the city beginning in 1092. By the time the siege ended in May 1094, he had carved out his own fiefdom—which he ruled from 15 June 1094 to July 1099. This victory was immortalised in the Lay of the Cid. During his rule, he converted nine mosques into churches and installed the French monk Jérôme as bishop of the See of Valencia. El Cid was killed in July 1099 while defending the city from an Almoravid siege, whereupon his wife Ximena Díaz ruled in his place for two years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was El Cid's real name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did El Cid die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 1099</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took El Cid's position after his death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ximena Díaz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did El Cid rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 June 1094 to July 1099</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the ruler when the new city wall was constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abd al-Aziz</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city went through serious troubles in the mid-fourteenth century. On the one hand were the decimation of the population by the Black Death of 1348 and subsequent years of epidemics — and on the other, the series of wars and riots that followed. Among these were the War of the Union, a citizen revolt against the excesses of the monarchy, led by Valencia as the capital of the kingdom — and the war with Castile, which forced the hurried raising of a new wall to resist Castilian attacks in 1363 and 1364. In these years the coexistence of the three communities that occupied the city—Christian, Jewish and Muslim — was quite contentious. The Jews who occupied the area around the waterfront had progressed economically and socially, and their quarter gradually expanded its boundaries at the expense of neighbouring parishes. Meanwhile, Muslims who remained in the city after the conquest were entrenched in a Moorish neighbourhood next to the present-day market Mosen Sorel. In 1391 an uncontrolled mob attacked the Jewish quarter, causing its virtual disappearance and leading to the forced conversion of its surviving members to Christianity. The Muslim quarter was attacked during a similar tumult among the populace in 1456, but the consequences were minor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Valencia suffer from the Black Death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1348</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which three religious groups lived in Valencia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian, Jewish and Muslim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Muslims lived near what current market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mosen Sorel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Jewish section attacked?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1391</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Muslim section attacked?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1456</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Faced with this loss of business, Valencia suffered a severe economic crisis.
