The USSR argued that the Convention's definition should follow the etymology of the term, and may have feared greater international scrutiny of its own Great Purge. Other nations feared that including political groups in the definition would invite international intervention in domestic politics. However leading genocide scholar William Schabas states: “Rigorous examination of the travaux fails to confirm a popular impression in the literature that the opposition to inclusion of political genocide was some Soviet machination. The Soviet views were also shared by a number of other States for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator: Lebanon, Sweden, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Egypt, Belgium, and Uruguay. The exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non-governmental organization, the World Jewish Congress, and it corresponded to Raphael Lemkin’s vision of the nature of the crime of genocide.” </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which provision was initially included in the first write-up of the Convention and then removed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">political killings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the countries that objected to the inclusion of political killings in the early version of the Convention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">USSR</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the primary concern of other nations who objected to including political groups in the definition of genocide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">international intervention in domestic politics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which distinguished academic of genocide highlighted several other countries opposed to including political genocide in the Convention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Schabas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What atrocity motivated a self-serving USSR to object to the provision of political killings drafted into the Convention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its own Great Purge</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2007 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), noted in its judgement on Jorgic v.

By formally recognizing the act of genocide as a crime, involves the undergoing prosecution that begins with not only seeing genocide as outrageous past any moral standpoint but also may be a legal liability within international relations. When genocide is looked at in a general aspect it is viewed as the deliberate killing of a certain group. Yet is commonly seen to escape the process of trial and prosecution due to the fact that genocide is more often than not committed by the officials in power of a state or area. In 1648 before the term genocide had been coined, the Peace of Westphalia was established to protect ethnic, national, racial and in some instances religious groups.

In that year, a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin, described the policies of systematic murder founded by the Nazis as genocide. The word genocide is the combination of the Greek prefix geno- (meaning tribe or race) and caedere (the Latin word for to kill).

International offences such as the crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been committed in Darfur may be no less serious and heinous than genocide.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been widely debated as a possible act of genocide in Sudan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">situation in Darfur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2003 what well known U.S. Secretary of State declared the situation in Darfur as an act of genocide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colin Powell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In front of which committee did Powell testify?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did UN Security Council Resolution 1564 authorize in 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Despite some concessions, what act did the Commission ultimately state that Sudan had not pursued?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">genocidal policy </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In March 2005, the Security Council formally referred the situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, taking into account the Commission report but without mentioning any specific crimes. Two permanent members of the Security Council, the United States and China, abstained from the vote on the referral resolution. As of his fourth report to the Security Council, the Prosecutor has found &quot;reasonable grounds to believe that the individuals identified [in the UN Security Council Resolution 1593] have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes,&quot; but did not find sufficient evidence to prosecute for genocide.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom did the Security Council officially refer the situation in Darfur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was taken into account, without mentioning specific crimes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Commission report</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">China and what other permanent member of the Security Council abstained from the vote on the referral resolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which number report to the Council did the Prosecutor concede that crimes had been committed but evidence for prosecution was insufficient?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his fourth report</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the build-up to genocide, what have other authors focused on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">structural conditions </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What processes are thought to create an evolution toward genocide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">psychological and social </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who revealed the starting points of this evolution to be economic deterioration and political confusion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ervin Staub</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A history of what is just one factor that contributes to the probability of violence developing into genocide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">devaluation of the group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one preventive effort in circumventing conditions that lead to genocide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humanizing a devalued group</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
