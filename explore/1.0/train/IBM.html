Having learned Patterson's pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies. He implemented sales conventions, &quot;generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker&quot;. His favorite slogan, &quot;THINK&quot;, became a mantra for each company's employees. During Watson's first four years, revenues more than doubled to $9 million and the company's operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. &quot;Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR&quot; and chose to replace it with the more expansive title &quot;International Business Machines&quot;.
