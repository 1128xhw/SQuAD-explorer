It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What device is able to change electric powerinto radio waves and also do the reverse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">An antenna </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What device is often used in conjuntion with the antenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">radio transmitter or radio receiver</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process associated with antennas produces a high frequency alternating current?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">transmission</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else can radio waves be called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electromagnetic waves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does an antenna catch electromagnetic waves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reception</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter.

Marconi discovered that by raising the &quot;aerial&quot; wire above the ground and connecting the other side of his transmitter to ground, the transmission range was increased. Soon he was able to transmit signals over a hill, a distance of approximately 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi). In Italian a tent pole is known as l'antenna centrale, and the pole with the wire was simply called l'antenna. Until then wireless radiating transmitting and receiving elements were known simply as aerials or terminals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is most associated with the emergence of the word antenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guglielmo Marconi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did experimentation with electromagnetic waves begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1895</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a way to increase the strength of a radio transmission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> raising the &quot;aerial&quot; wire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far was Marconi able to get his signal to go using this technique?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.5 mi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Antennas are required by any radio receiver or transmitter to couple its electrical connection to the electromagnetic field.

The dipole antenna, which is the basis for most antenna designs, is a balanced component, with equal but opposite voltages and currents applied at its two terminals through a balanced transmission line (or to a coaxial transmission line through a so-called balun). The vertical antenna, on the other hand, is a monopole antenna. It is typically connected to the inner conductor of a coaxial transmission line (or a matching network); the shield of the transmission line is connected to ground. In this way, the ground (or any large conductive surface) plays the role of the second conductor of a dipole, thereby forming a complete circuit. Since monopole antennas rely on a conductive ground, a so-called grounding structure may be employed to provide a better ground contact to the earth or which itself acts as a ground plane to perform that function regardless of (or in absence of) an actual contact with the earth.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are basic antennas expensive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relatively inexpensive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the foundation most often used when creating new antenna models?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dipole antenna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What category do vertical antennas fall under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monopole antenna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used to close the circuit of a dipole antenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large conductive surface</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Antennas more complex than the dipole or vertical designs are usually intended to increase the directivity and consequently the gain of the antenna.

Antenna &quot;gain&quot; in this instance describes the concentration of radiated power into a particular solid angle of space, as opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of the ideal radiator.

The monopole antenna is essentially one half of the half-wave dipole, a single 1⁄4-wavelength element with the other side connected to ground or an equivalent ground plane (or counterpoise). Monopoles, which are one-half the size of a dipole, are common for long-wavelength radio signals where a dipole would be impractically large.

In roles where higher performance is needed, designers often use multiple elements combined together.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What accounts for the geometry involved in the use of an antenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> inverse square law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What refers to ratios of powers generated versus peers that are innate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">effective area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> How is the compactness of the signal measured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Watts per square metre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of project would call for more than one element used together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> higher performance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Returning to the basic concept of current flows in a conductor, consider what happens if a half-wave dipole is not connected to a feed point, but instead shorted out. Electrically this forms a single 1⁄2-wavelength element. But the overall current pattern is the same; the current will be zero at the two ends, and reach a maximum in the center. Thus signals near the design frequency will continue to create a standing wave pattern. Any varying electrical current, like the standing wave in the element, will radiate a signal. In this case, aside from resistive losses in the element, the rebroadcast signal will be significantly similar to the original signal in both magnitude and shape. If this element is placed so its signal reaches the main dipole in-phase, it will reinforce the original signal, and increase the current in the dipole.

It turns out that the amount of reactance seen at the terminals of a resonant antenna when the frequency is shifted, say, by 5%, depends very much on the diameter of the conductor used. A long thin wire used as a half-wave dipole (or quarter wave monopole) will have a reactance significantly greater than the resistive impedance it has at resonance, leading to a poor match and generally unacceptable performance. Making the element using a tube of a diameter perhaps 1/50 of its length, however, results in a reactance at this altered frequency which is not so great, and a much less serious mismatch which will only modestly damage the antenna's net performance.

This widens the bandwidth of the resonance. On the other hand, amateur radio antennas need to operate over several bands which are widely separated from each other. This can often be accomplished simply by connecting resonant elements for the different bands in parallel. Most of the transmitter's power will flow into the resonant element while the others present a high (reactive) impedance and draw little current from the same voltage. A popular solution uses so-called traps consisting of parallel resonant circuits which are strategically placed in breaks along each antenna element. When used at one particular frequency band the trap presents a very high impedance (parallel resonance) effectively truncating the element at that length, making it a proper resonant antenna. At a lower frequency the trap allows the full length of the element to be employed, albeit with a shifted resonant frequency due to the inclusion of the trap's net reactance at that lower frequency.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What effect do cages have on the spectrum of usable frequencies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">widens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of tubes are generally used for sturdier always of antennas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How could one achieve the task of creating an antenna that can be Used over various bands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> connecting resonant elements</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an essential for dealing with directing the flow of power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trap's</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gain is a parameter which measures the degree of directivity of the antenna's radiation pattern.

After all, Q is short for &quot;quality factor&quot; and a low Q typically signifies excessive loss (due to unwanted resistance) in a resonant L-C circuit. However this understanding does not apply to resonant antennas where the resistance involved is the radiation resistance, a desired quantity which removes energy from the resonant element in order to radiate it (the purpose of an antenna, after all!). The Q is a measure of the ratio of reactance to resistance, so with a fixed radiation resistance (an element's radiation resistance is almost independent of its diameter) a greater reactance off-resonance corresponds to the poorer bandwidth of a very thin conductor. The Q of such a narrowband antenna can be as high as 15. On the other hand, a thick element presents less reactance at an off-resonant frequency, and consequently a Q as low as 5. These two antennas will perform equivalently at the resonant frequency, but the second antenna will perform over a bandwidth 3 times as wide as the &quot;hi-Q&quot; antenna consisting of a thin conductor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The properties of a usable radio frequency can be called its?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Q</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a measure of the comparison between reactance and resistance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Q</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the largest Q that could be achieved with a slimmer band antenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of element would be used to encounter less reactance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thick</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For example, at 30 MHz (10 m wavelength) a true resonant 1⁄4-wavelength monopole would be almost 2.5 meters long, and using an antenna only 1.5 meters tall would require the addition of a loading coil.

However, the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit lower than the impedance of a resonant monopole, likely requiring further impedance matching. In addition to a lower radiation resistance, the reactance becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced, and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a Q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted.

Thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna. Changing the antenna's height by a quarter wavelength, then changes the phase of the reflection by 180°, with a completely different effect on the antenna's impedance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can receive a stron signal by transmitting an original wave?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">actual antenna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where will the additional current be induced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> antenna elemen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is altered because of the proximity to the ground?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antenna's impedance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what happens to the reflected wave which allows the antenna to reach its asympotic feedpoint impedance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reduced power</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For horizontal propagation between transmitting and receiving antennas situated near the ground reasonably far from each other, the distances traveled by tne direct and reflected rays are nearly the same.

Therefore, in discussions of antenna properties no distinction is usually made between receiving and transmitting terminology, and the antenna can be viewed as either transmitting or receiving, whichever is more convenient.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are essential properties of an antenna changed based on what fungtion they are performing</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the same </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What proposition explains the equivalency of the recieving pattern of an antenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reciprocity theorem of electromagnetics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can the antenna serve more than one fungtion at a time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">either transmitting or receiving</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one electrical trait of an antenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> radiation pattern</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
