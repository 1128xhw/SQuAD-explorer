As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club. On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled &quot;Oda a Platko&quot;, which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko. On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what day did the stadium crowd jeer the Royal March in protest against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14 June 1925</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the directors of Barcelona first claim to operate a professional football club?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1926</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did the FC Barca hold a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara against the Spanish national team?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 July 1927</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the poem titled &quot;Oda a Platko&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rafael Alberti</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Gamper commit suicide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 July 1930</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1925 what incident by the crowd caused the closing of the stadium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> jeered the Royal March</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was the stadium closed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> six months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Barcelona claim to be a professional football club?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1926</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Barcelona win the Spanish League?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23 June 1929</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What past president of the Barcelona club committed suicide in 1930?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gamper</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.

He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Bernabéu along the way. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971).

With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What team was dominate in the 1960s in La Liga?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Real Madrid </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Due to the emergence of Fuste and Rexach, what competition did Barcelona win in 1963?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Copa del Generalísimo </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What competition did Barcelona win in 1966?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Fairs Cup</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was present when Barcelona beat Real Madrid in 1968?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Franco</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With Franco's dictatorship over, to what did Barcelona change their name ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Futbol Club Barcelona</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.

The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch.

Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Llorenç Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What team did favorite play Luis Figo leave Barcelona to join?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Real Madrid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of treatment was Figo offered during visits to Barcelona?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hostile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After Figo's departure what happened the next three years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> decline</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rank was club Barcelona in 2003?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 15th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After Barcelona's poor showing in the 2003 season , who resigned from the presidency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joan Gaspart</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Two days later, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return to Barcelona as head coach, after he agreed to a two-year deal.
