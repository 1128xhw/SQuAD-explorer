Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.

The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern oaks, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what stage of its life does a tree usually grow the fastest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">youth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As a tree ages, do its growth rings usually get wider or narrower?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">narrower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of a tree opens and spreads out more as it matures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">crown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is wood production of a tree lessened or increased as it ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lessened</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with nutrients, what do trees growing in forests have to compete for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature.

Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per millilitre (g/cm3 or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as basic specific gravity (Timell 1986).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which property of wood reveals the most about its quality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">specific gravity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to lumber strength, what important indicator of wood's quality can be determined using specific gravity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pulp yield</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What measurement is expressed in mass per unit substance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">density</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When wood dries and shrinks, what happens to its density?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When wood is described as &quot;green,&quot; what does &quot;green&quot; mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">water-saturated</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into “one fairly easily measured wood characteristic” (Elliott 1970).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with growth, what kind of factors determine the density of wood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">physiological</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Into how many characteristics are the factors of wood combined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What author called wood's density &quot;fairly easily measured&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elliott</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Age, diameter, height, radial growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, silvicultural treatment, and seed source, all to some degree influence wood density.
