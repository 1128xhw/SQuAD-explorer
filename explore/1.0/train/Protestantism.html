It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom, together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.

Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas,[c] Denmark,[d] Norway,[e] Sweden,[f] Finland,[g] Prussia,[h] Latvia,[i], Estonia,[j] and Iceland,[k] as well as other smaller territories. Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions,[l] Hungary,[m] the Netherlands,[n] Scotland,[o] Switzerland,[p] and France[q] by such reformers as John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and John Knox. Arminianism[r] gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany. In 1534, King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England[s] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon; this opened the door to reformational ideas, notably during the following reign of Edward VI, through Thomas Cranmer, Richard Hooker, Matthew Parker and other theologians. There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation—a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers—which gave rise to Anabaptist, Moravian, and other Pietistic movements. In later centuries, Protestants developed their own culture, which made major contributions in education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy and the arts, and other fields.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Lutheranism begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name three early Protestant reformers.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and John Knox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Arminianism take hold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Netherlands and parts of Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ended Catholic supremecy in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Henry VIII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made large contributions in the sciences in latter centuries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestants</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents, or nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide, Protestantism is present on all populated continents.[t] The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism, lacking both structural unity and central human authority.

The word evangelical (German: evangelisch), which refers to the gospel, was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement. Nowadays, this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations, above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch means Protestant, and is different from the German evangelikal, which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole. It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States. The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German, and is different from English reformed (German: reformiert), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what language does the term evangelical originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What German word refers to the gospel or being Protestant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evangelisch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What English word for a church began with the Puritans in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evangelical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name two contributors to Reformed churches.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who brought Evangelicalism to the U.S.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Puritans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation, based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura (by scripture alone).

Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes, promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam, giving free passage to Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the Cévennes region.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nickname for French Protestants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Huguenots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the French find alienating about Catholicism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were French nobles converted to Protestantism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1550s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 1572</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose death caused an increase in the French civil wars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry II</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who began the Protestant movement in Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Huldrych Zwingli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two areas had a long history of resentment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the German states and the Swiss Confederation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the meeting to make an alliance between Zwingli and Luther?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Colloquy of Marburg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Prince hosted the Colloquy of Marburg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Philip of Hesse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Colloquy of Marburg become infamous for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its failure</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (via media) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under Thomas Cromwell, the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under whose reign did the Church of England part from Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry VIII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Act of Supremacy passed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1534</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made Anglicanism into a more distinct tradition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Elizabethan Religious Settlement </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what years were the Dissolution of the Monasteries carried out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Between 1535 and 1540</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was made the Supreme Head of the Church of England in 1534?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Henry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age.

Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants. The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist, claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void, the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism. As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics.[aa] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise.[ab] They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism. Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front. Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden, Thomas Müntzer, Kaspar Schwenkfeld, Sebastian Franck, Menno Simons. Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck, Conrad Grebel, Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the word Anabaptist describe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one who baptizes again</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who named the Anabaptists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their persecutors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What baptism do Anabaptists reject?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">baptism of infants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who persecuted the Anabaptists in the 16th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hans Denck was considered what type of reformer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second Front Reformer</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs, worship practices and church structures.

Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings.

As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other.

The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values. Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science.

Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle (doctrine of the two kingdoms). The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture; 1523). Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his representative church government. The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other reformed churches.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the doctrine that separated church and non-religious affairs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">doctrine of the two kingdoms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who added the election of laymen to church government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calvin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the treatise that allowed a congregation to elect or remove a minister?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1523</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who added synods to church government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Huguenots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Luther's followers advised to use when governing worldly affairs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reason</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: &quot;It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.&quot; Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What political mixture did Calvin prefer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aristocracy and democracy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for checks and balances in a political system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">separation of powers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who paved the way for modern democracy to emerge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calvin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was allowed to teach a liberal Bible interpretation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugo Grotius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophers were given asylum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies.

Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers. These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.

Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework. The great majority of American Protestants, both clergy and laity, strongly supported the independence movement. All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world (e.g., Latin America, Japan, and Germany). The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette, an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette's draft of this document. The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group initiated the right to religious freedom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Luther refuse to change his beliefs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Worms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What persecuted groups followed the separation of church and state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anabaptists and Huguenots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote about religious freedom in the early 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Smyth and Thomas Helwys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many American Protestants supported independence in America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The great majority</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Democracy, social-contract theory, separation of powers, religious freedom, separation of church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers.

For example, John Locke, whose political thought was based on &quot;a set of Protestant Christian assumptions&quot;, derived the equality of all humans, including the equality of the genders (&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;), from Genesis 1, 26-28. As all persons were created equally free, all governments needed &quot;the consent of the governed.&quot; These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence, which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group popularized early Protestant teachings about separation of church and state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Enlightenment thinkers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Locke use as a basis for his political beliefs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a set of Protestant Christian assumptions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose ideas influenced the Declaration of Independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Locke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Rights do the Declaration of Independence consider unalienable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What scripture did Locke use as a reference for equality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genesis 1, 26-28</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Also, other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants.

These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary, it remains one of the most popular religions. Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, there are only few Protestant adherents; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, restrictions during the Communist rule, and also the ongoing secularization. Over the last several decades, religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased. According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Protestants made up 12% of the EU population. According to Pew Research Center, Protestants constituted nearly one fifth (or 17.8%) of the continent's Christian population in 2010. Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15% of all Europeans in 2009, while Noll claims that less than 12% of them lived in Europe in 2010.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what European areas is Protestantism still the most practiced religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2012, what percentage of the EU was thought to be Protestant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what countries is Protestantism one of the most popular (but not THE most popular) religions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Pew Research Center estimated Protestants to be what percentage of Europe's Christian population in 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17.8%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area was once the site of a significant pre-reformation movement, but now only has a small number of Protestants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Czech Republic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant. Since 1900, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion. Much of the growth has occurred after World War II, when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred. According to one source, Protestants constituted respectively 2.5%, 2%, 0.5% of Latin Americans, Africans and Asians. In 2000, percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17%, more than 27% and 5.5%, respectively. According to Mark A. Noll, 79% of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910, while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth. By 2010, 59% of Anglicans were found in Africa. In 2010, more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany, while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined. Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe. China is home to world's largest Protestant minority.[af]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where has Protestantism spread quickly since the 1900's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did much of the spread of Protestantism occur in the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">after World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2010, what percentage of Anglicans were said to be in Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">59%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Anglicans were in the UK in 1910?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">79%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2010, what country had more Protestants than both the UK and Germany together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brazil</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
