Following the recent unrest in Tibet, three members of Reporters Without Borders, including Robert Ménard, breached security and attempted to disrupt a speech by Liu Qi, the head of Beijing's Olympic organising committee during the torch lighting ceremony in Olympia, Greece. The People's Republic of China called this a &quot;disgraceful&quot; attempt to sabotage the Olympics. On March 30, 2008 in Athens, during ceremonies marking the handing over of the torch from Greek officials to organizers of the Beijing games, demonstrators shouted 'Free Tibet' and unfurled banners; some 10 of the 15 protesters were taken into police detention.

 China: In China, the torch was first welcomed by Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang and State Councilor Liu Yandong. It was subsequently passed onto CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao. A call to boycott French hypermart Carrefour from May 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the Chinese over the weekend from April 12, accusing the company's major shareholder, the LVMH Group, of donating funds to the Dalai Lama. There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products. According to the Washington Times on April 15, however, the Chinese government was attempting to &quot;calm the situation&quot; through censorship: &quot;All comments posted on popular Internet forum Sohu.com relating to a boycott of Carrefour have been deleted.&quot; Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some burned French flags, some added Nazism's Swastika to the French flag, and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy. The Carrefour boycott was met with anti-boycott demonstrators who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming, only to be blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Action was taken to boycott which company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carrefour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the biggest shareholder of Carrefour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the LVMH Group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did some protesters burn?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French flag</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were anti-protesters blocked from entering a Carrefour store with Chinese flags?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kunming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was said to have given money to the Dalai Lama?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the LVMH Group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What method did the Chinese government use to ease the boycott situation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">censorship</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What French company was being boycotted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carrefour</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In response to the demonstrations, an editorial in the People's Daily urged Chinese people to &quot;express [their] patriotic enthusiasm calmly and rationally, and express patriotic aspiration in an orderly and legal manner&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what publication were Chinese people asked to be orderly and legal because of the protests and demonstrations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">People's Daily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the publication where Chinese people were advised to be calm and rational about patriotism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">People's Daily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Chinese people were told to show patriotism in an orderly and what manner?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">legal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>

 Great Britain: The torch relay leg held in London, the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics, on April 6 began at Wembley Stadium, passed through the City of London, and eventually ended at O2 Arena in the eastern part of the city. The 48 km (30 mi) leg took a total of seven and a half hours to complete, and attracted protests by pro-Tibetan independence and pro-Human Rights supporters, prompting changes to the planned route and an unscheduled move onto a bus, which was then briefly halted by protestors. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has officially complained to Beijing Organising Committee about the conduct of the tracksuit-clad Chinese security guards. The Chinese officials, seen manhandling protesters, were described by both the London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Lord Coe, chairman of the London Olympic Committee as &quot;thugs&quot;. A Metropolitan police briefing paper revealed that security for the torch relay cost £750,000 and the participation of the Chinese security team had been agreed in advance, despite the Mayor stating, &quot;We did not know beforehand these thugs were from the security services. Had I known so, we would have said no.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city hosted the 2012 Summer Olympics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch route begin in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 6</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did security cost for the torch relay in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£750,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city held the Olympics in 2012?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the torch relay begin in London for the 2008 Olympics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wembley Stadium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the relay end in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">O2 Arena</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles was the relay in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 mi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word was used by London officials to describe Chinese security guards for their treatment of protesters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thugs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could &quot;see why they would like to make an issue&quot; of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as &quot;a mobile protective ring.&quot; Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized change to the route amid security concerns. The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street amid security concerns and efforts to evade the protesters. In an effort to counter the pro-Tibet protesters and show their support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, more than 2,000 Chinese also gathered on the torch route and demonstrated with signs, banners and Chinese flags. A large number of supporters were concentrated in Trafalgar Square, displaying the Olympic slogan &quot;One World, One Dream&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many torchbearers took part in the London route?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person to hold the torch for the London route?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Steve Redgrave</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Francesca Martinez, who decided to not carry the torch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard Vaughan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was outside at 10 Downing Street to welcome the torch without actually touching it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who got emails asking him to boycott the torch relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Steve Redgrave</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people carried the torch in England for the 2008 Olympics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two people in England declined to bear the torch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Gordon Brown welcome the torch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 Downing Street</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was an attempt made to take the torch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ladbroke Grove</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>
 France: The torch relay leg in Paris, held on April 7, began on the first level of the Eiffel Tower and finished at the Stade Charléty. The relay was initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists, who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading &quot;Paris defends human rights throughout the world&quot; to the City Hall, in an attempt to promote values &quot;of all humanity and of human rights.&quot; Members from Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests, including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand over to Teddy Riner: &quot;I understand they're afraid of everything, but this is just annoying. They extinguished the flame despite the fact that there was no risk, and they could see it and they knew it. I don't know why they did it.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch relay in Paris occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 7</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Paris route start for the torch relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Eiffel Tower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Rather than being carried by an athlete, how did the torch end its route in Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by bus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The flame of the torch was put out when David Douillet was ready to hand it to who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teddy Riner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date did the torch relay begin in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 7</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city in France did the torch relay start at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where location was the torch relay started in the city in Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eiffel Tower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many police were said to have protected the torch in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was the torch put out in France die to security concerns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chinese officials canceled the torch relay ceremony amidst disruptions, including a Tibetan flag flown from a window in the City Hall by Green Party officials.

On the day of the relay officials diverted the torch run to an unannounced route. The start was at McCovey Cove, where Norman Bellingham of the U.S. Olympic Committee gave the torch to the first torchbearer, Chinese 1992 Olympic champion swimmer Lin Li. The planned closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled and instead, a ceremony was held at San Francisco International Airport, where the torch was to leave for Buenos Aires. The route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of China supporters and protesters against China. As people found out there would be no closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza, there were angry reactions. One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to &quot;thwart any organized protest that had been planned.&quot; San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a &quot;cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money.&quot; Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in &quot;everyone's best interest&quot; and that he believed people had been &quot;afforded the right to protest and support the torch&quot; despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, &quot;The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded.&quot; People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC. The cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be USD $726,400, nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising. Mayor Gavin Newsom said that &quot;exponential&quot; costs associated with mass arrests were avoided by his decision to change the route in consultation with police chief Heather Fong.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the torch start it's North American route?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Francisco</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What day did the torch arrive in San Francisco?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 9</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the first North American torchbearer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lin Li</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The route end was changed from Justin Herman plaza to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Francisco International Airport</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the head of the U.S. Olympic Committee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peter Ueberroth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city in the United States held the 2008 Olympic Torch relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Francisco</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date of the relay in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 9.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the person who handed off the torch to the torchbearer in the United States 2008 Olympic relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Norman Bellingham</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the location where the relay ending event was canceled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Justin Herman Plaza</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On April 1, 2008, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a resolution addressing human rights concerns when the Beijing Olympic torch arrives in San Francisco on April 9.

Among them was San Francisco resident Laurel Sutherlin, who spoke to the local TV station KPIX-CBS5 live from a cellphone, urging the International Olympic Committee to ask China not to allow the torch to go through Tibet. &quot;Sutherlin said he was worried that the torch's planned route through Tibet would lead to more arrests and Chinese officials would use force to stifle dissent.&quot; The three activists and five supporters face charges related to trespassing, conspiracy and causing a public nuisance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Three protester climbed what to hang two banners on April 7, 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Golden Gate Bridge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Laurel Sutherlin spoke to which TV station about his concerns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">KPIX-CBS5</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who asked that the San Francisco relay route be shortened?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">China</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What famous bridge had two banners hung from it by protesters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Golden Gate Bridge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who spoke to station KPIX-CBS5 about the bridge banner protests?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Laurel Sutherlin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many supporters face charges for the bridge stunt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many activists may be charged with crimes for the bridge stunt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The torch was lit at a park outside at AT&amp;T Park at about 1:17 pm PDT (20:17 UTC), briefly held aloft by American and Chinese Olympic officials. The relay descended into confusion as the first runner in the elaborately planned relay disappeared into a warehouse on a waterfront pier where it stayed for a half-an-hour. There were clashes between thousands of pro-China demonstrators, many of whom said they were bused in by the Chinese Consulate and other pro-China groups, and both pro-Tibet and Darfur protesters. The non-Chinese demonstrators were reported to have been swamped and trailed by angry crowds. Around 2 pm PDT (21:00 UTC), the torch resurfaced about 3 km (1.9 mi) away from the stadium along Van Ness Avenue, a heavily trafficked thoroughfare that was not on official route plans. Television reports showed the flame flanked by motorcycles and uniformed police officers. Two torchbearers carried the flame running slowly behind a truck and surrounded by Olympic security guards. During the torch relay, two torchbearers, Andrew Michael who uses a wheelchair and is the Vice President for Sustainable Development for the Bay Area Council and Director of Partnerships For Change, and an environmental advocate, Majora Carter, managed to display Tibetan flags in protest, resulting in their ejection from the relay. The closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was canceled due to the presence of large numbers of protesters at the site. The torch run ended with a final stretch through San Francisco's Marina district and was then moved by bus to San Francisco International Airport for a makeshift closing ceremony at the terminal, from which the free media was excluded. San Jose Mercury News described the &quot;deceiving&quot; event as &quot;a game of Where's Waldo, played against the landscape of a lovely city.&quot; International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said the San Francisco relay had &quot;fortunately&quot; avoided much of the disruptions that marred the legs in London and Paris, but &quot;was, however, not the joyous party that we had wished it to be.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the first relay runner disappear to with the torch??</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a warehouse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which wheelchair-bound torchbearer was ejected from the relay for showing a Tibetan flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andrew Michael</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What wheelchair-bound bearer of the Olympic torch displayed a Tibetan flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andrew Michael</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the last part of the San Francisco torch relay carried through before getting on a bus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marina district</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was a makeshift closing ceremony held for the torch relay in San Francisco?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Francisco International Airport</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the bearer of the torch disappeared into a warehouse, what road did the relay reappear on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Van Ness Avenue</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre> Argentina: The torch relay leg in Buenos Aires, Argentina, held on April 11, began with an artistic show at the Lola Mora amphitheatre in Costanera Sur.

The leg finished at the Buenos Aires Riding Club in the Palermo district, the last torchbearer being Gabriela Sabatini. The 13.8 km route included landmarks like the obelisk and Plaza de Mayo. The day was marked by several pro-Tibet protests, which included a giant banner reading &quot;Free Tibet&quot;, and an alternative &quot;human rights torch&quot; that was lit by protesters and paraded along the route the flame was to take. Most of these protests were peaceful in nature, and the torch was not impeded. Chinese immigrants also turned out in support of the Games, but only minor scuffles were reported between both groups. Runners surrounded by rows of security carried the Olympic flame past thousands of jubilant Argentines in the most trouble-free torch relay in nearly a week. People showered the parade route with confetti as banks, government offices and businesses took an impromptu half-day holiday for the only Latin American stop on the flame's five-continent journey.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Olympic torch relay begin in Buenos Aires?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 11</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the torch route start in Buenos Aires?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Lola Mora amphitheatre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the mayor of Buenos Aires?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mauricio Macri</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Olympic torch relay begin in Argentina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buenos Aires</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What place held an opening show for the relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lola Mora amphitheatre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the mayor who passed off the torch to the first bearer in Argentina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mauricio Macri</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first bearer of the torch in Argentina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carlos Espínola.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was showered along the route in some places?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">confetti</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Argentine activists told a news conference that they would not try to snuff out the torch's flame as demonstrators had in Paris and London. &quot;I want to announce that we will not put out the Olympic torch,&quot; said pro-Tibet activist Jorge Carcavallo. &quot;We'll be carrying out surprise actions throughout the city of Buenos Aires, but all of these will be peaceful.&quot; Among other activities, protesters organized an alternative march that went from the Obelisk to the city hall, featuring their own &quot;Human Rights Torch.&quot; A giant banner reading &quot;Free Tibet&quot; was also displayed on the torch route.

The torch was lit by Vice-President Ali Mohamed Shein. About a thousand people followed the relay, waving the Olympic flag.

 Pakistan: The Olympic torch reached Islamabad for the first time ever on April 16. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani spoke at the opening ceremony of the relay. Security was high, for what one newspaper called the &quot;most sensitive leg&quot; of the torch's Olympic journey. The relay was initially supposed to carry the torch around Islamabad, but the entire relay was cancelled due to security concerns regarding &quot;militant threats or anti-China protests&quot;, and replaced by an indoors ceremony with the torch carried around the track of Jinnah Stadium. In fear of violent protests and bomb attacks, the torch relay in Pakistan took place in a stadium behind closed doors. Although the relay was behind closed doors, thousands of policemen and soldiers guarded the flame. As a consequence, no incidents arose.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch arrive in Islamabad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 16</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was an indoor ceremony held since the outdoor relay was cancelled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jinnah Stadium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who spoke at the opening ceremony in Islamabad in addition to President Musharraf?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Olympic torch relay start in Pakistan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamabad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of a traditinal relay, where was the track the torch was carried in Pakistan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jinnah Stadium.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>
 India: Due to concerns about pro-Tibet protests, the relay through New Delhi on April 17 was cut to just 2.3 km (less than 1.5 miles), which was shared amongst 70 runners. It concluded at the India Gate. The event was peaceful due to the public not being allowed at the relay. A total of five intended torchbearers -Kiran Bedi, Soha Ali Khan, Sachin Tendulkar, Bhaichung Bhutia and Sunil Gavaskar- withdrew from the event, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;, or, in Bhutia's case, explicitly wishing to &quot;stand by the people of Tibet and their struggle&quot; and protest against the PRC &quot;crackdown&quot; in Tibet. Indian national football captain, Baichung Bhutia refused to take part in the Indian leg of the torch relay, citing concerns over Tibet. Bhutia, who is Sikkimese, is the first athlete to refuse to run with the torch. Indian film star Aamir Khan states on his personal blog that the &quot;Olympic Games do not belong to China&quot; and confirms taking part in the torch relay &quot;with a prayer in his heart for the people of Tibet, and ... for all people across the world who are victims of human rights violations&quot;. Rahul Gandhi, son of the Congress President Sonia Gandhi and scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family, also refused to carry the torch.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch visit New Delhi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 17</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many runners carried the torch in New Delhi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which football captain did not participate in the relay to show support for Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baichung Bhutia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many torchbearers did not participate because of their concerns with Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the torch relay happen in India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Delhi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was the route in India in miles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.5</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bearers of the torch were used in India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bearers decided not to participate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the footballer who refused to be a part of the relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baichung Bhutia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Wary of protests, the Indian authorities have decided to shorten the route of the relay in New Delhi, and have given it the security normally associated with Republic Day celebrations, which are considered terrorist targets.

 Thailand: The April 18 relay through Bangkok was the Olympic flame's first visit to Thailand. The relay covered just over 10 km, and included Bangkok's Chinatown. The torch was carried past Democracy Monument, Chitralada Palace and a number of other city landmarks. M.R. Narisa Chakrabongse, Green World Foundation (GWF) chairwoman, withdrew from the torch-running ceremony, protesting against China's actions in Tibet. Several hundred protesters were present, along with Olympic supporters. Thai authorities threatened to arrest foreign protesters and ban them from future entry into Thailand. A coalition of Thai human rights groups announced that it would organise a &quot;small demonstration&quot; during the relay, and several hundred people did indeed take part in protests, facing Beijing supporters. Intended torchbearer Mom Rajawongse Narissara Chakrabongse boycotted the relay, to protest against China's actions in Tibet.

 Indonesia: The Olympic flame reached Jakarta on April 22. The original 20 km relay through Jakarta was cancelled due to &quot;security worries&quot;, at the request of the Chinese embassy, and the torch was instead carried round the city main's stadium, as it had been in Islamabad. Several dozen pro-Tibet protesters gathered near the stadium, and were dispersed by the police. The event was held in the streets around the city main's stadium. The cancelling of the relay through the city itself was decided due to security concerns and at the request of the Chinese embassy. Only invitees and journalists were admitted inside the stadium. Protests took place outside the stadium.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Olympic torch visit Jakarta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 22</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who requested that the original route be cancelled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Chinese embassy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with invited people, who were the only other people allowed in the stadium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">journalists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the torch relay begin in Indonesia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jakarta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many kilometers was the planned route that was cancelled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the first route not taken?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">security worries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of facility was the torch carried at instead.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stadium.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did protests occur when non one except invited guests and the press were allowed inside the stadium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">outside the stadium.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>
 Australia: The event was held in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory on April 24, and covered around 16 km of Canberra's central areas, from Reconciliation Place to Commonwealth Park. Upon its arrival in Canberra, the Olympic flame was presented by Chinese officials to local Aboriginal elder Agnes Shea, of the Ngunnawal people. She, in turn, offered them a message stick, as a gift of peace and welcome. Hundreds of pro-Tibet protesters and thousands of Chinese students reportedly attended. Demonstrators and counter-demonstrators were kept apart by the Australian Federal Police. Preparations for the event were marred by a disagreement over the role of the Chinese flame attendants, with Australian and Chinese officials arguing publicly over their function and prerogatives during a press conference.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch arrive in Canberra?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 24</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who received the flame from Chinese officials in Canberra?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Agnes Shea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Agnes Shea give to the Chinese in return?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a message stick</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who publicly argued at a press conference?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australian and Chinese officials</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the relay held in Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canberra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many kilometers was the route in Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the location of the beginning of the Olympic torch route in Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Reconciliation Place</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who kept the demonstrators separated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australian Federal Police.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the Aboriginal elder who received the torch from Chinese officials?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Agnes Shea</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the events in Olympia, there were reports that China requested permission to deploy People's Liberation Army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in Canberra. Australian authorities stated that such a request, if it were to be made, would be refused. Chinese officials labeled it a rumor. Australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators, following a call by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Chinese Australian students to &quot;go defend our sacred torch&quot; against &quot;ethnic degenerate scum and anti-China separatists&quot;. Tony Goh, chairman of the Australian Council of Chinese Organisations, has said the ACCO would be taking &quot;thousands&quot; of pro-Beijing demonstrators to Canberra by bus, to support the torch relay. Zhang Rongan, a Chinese Australian student organising pro-Beijing demonstrations, told the press that Chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses, meals and accommodation for pro-Beijing demonstrators, and helping them organise a &quot;peaceful show of strength&quot;.

 Japan: The event was held in Nagano, which hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics, on April 26. Japanese Buddhist temple Zenkō-ji, which was originally scheduled to be the starting point for the Olympic torch relay in Nagano, refused to host the torch and pulled out of the relay plans, amid speculation that monks there sympathized with anti-Chinese government protesters. as well as the risk of disruption by violent protests. Parts of Zenkō-ji temple's main building (Zenkō-ji Hondō), reconstructed in 1707 and one of the National Treasures of Japan, was then vandalized with spraypaint. A new starting point, previously the site of a municipal building and now a parking lot, was chosen by the city. An event the city had planned to hold at the Minami Nagano Sports Park following the torch relay was also canceled out of concern about disruptions caused by demonstrators protesting against China's recent crackdown in Tibet. Thousands of riot police were mobilized to protect the torch along its route. The show of force kept most protesters in check, but slogans shouted by pro-China or pro-Tibet demonstrators, Japanese nationalists, and human rights organizations flooded the air. Five men were arrested and four injured amidst scenes of mob violence. The torch route was packed with mostly peaceful demonstrators. The public was not allowed at the parking lot where the relay started. After the Zenkoji monks held a prayer ceremony for victims of the recent events in Tibet. More than 100 police officers ran with the torch and riot police lined the streets while three helicopters flew above. Only two Chinese guards were allowed to accompany the torch because of Japan's concern over their treatment of demonstrators at previous relays. A man with a Tibetan flag tried to stop the torch at the beginning of the relay but was dragged off by police. Some raw eggs were also thrown from the crowd.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nagano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch arrive in Nagano?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 26</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the torch relay held in Japan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nagano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Olympics did Nagano host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1998 Winter Olympics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What location was supposed to be the start of the relay event in Nagano?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japanese Buddhist temple Zenkō-ji</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When monks pulled out of the event, where was the new starting point for the relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a municipal building</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Chinese guards were allowed to go with the torch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre> South Korea: The event was held in Seoul, which hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, on April 27. Intended torchbearers Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun boycotted the event to protest against the Chinese government's crackdown in Tibet. More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route, which began at Olympic Park, which was built when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students clashed with protesters, throwing rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK, attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees. He poured gasoline on himself but police quickly surrounded him and carried him away. Two other demonstrators tried to storm the torch but failed. Fighting broke out near the beginning of the relay between a group of 500 Chinese supporters and approximately 50 protesters who carried a banner that read: &quot;Free North Korean refugees in China.&quot; The students threw stones and water bottles as approximately 2,500 police tried to keep the groups separated. Police said they arrested five people, including a Chinese student who was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks. Thousands of Chinese followed the torch on its 4.5 hour journey, some chanting, &quot;Go China, go Olympics!&quot; By the end of the relay, Chinese students became violent, and it was reported in Korean media that they were &quot;lynching&quot; everyone who was disagreeing with them. One police man was also rushed to hospital after being attacked by Chinese students. On Apr 29, the Secretary of Justice, Kim Kyung Han, told the prime minister that he will find &quot;every single Chinese who was involved and bring them to justice.&quot; Later in the day, South Korea's Prosecutor's Office, National Police Agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and National Intelligence Service made a joint statement saying that they will be deporting every Chinese student that was involved in the incident. China defended the conduct of the students.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the torch relay event held in South Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Seoul</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Seoul host the Olympics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1988 Summer Olympics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the start point for the relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Olympic Park</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became violent during the relay route and was promised deportation when caught?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese students</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the relay event held in South Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Seoul</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Olympics did Seoul host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1988 Summer Olympics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>
 North Korea: The event was held in Pyongyang on April 28. It was the first time that the Olympic torch has traveled to North Korea. A crowd of thousands waving pink paper flowers and small flags with the Beijing Olympics logo were organized by the authoritarian regime watched the beginning of the relay in Pyongyang, some waving Chinese flags. The event was presided over by the head of the country's parliament, Kim Yong Nam. The North, an ally of China, has been critical of disruptions to the torch relay elsewhere and has supported Beijing in its actions against protests in Tibet. Kim passed the torch to the first runner Pak Du Ik, who played on North Korea's 1966 World Cup soccer team, as he began the 19-kilometre route through Pyongyang. The relay began from the large sculpted flame of the obelisk of the Juche Tower, which commemorates the national ideology of Juche, or &quot;self-reliance&quot;, created by the country's late founding President Kim Il Sung, father of leader Kim Jong Il, who did not attend.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch arrive in Pyongyang?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 28</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who presided over the torch event in North Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kim Yong Nam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first torchbearer in North Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pak Du Ik</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the relay start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Juche Tower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the relay event held in North Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pyongyang.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date did the torch relay event take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 28.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did people in the crowd wave at the beginning of the relay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pink paper flowers and small flags</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first runner with the torch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pak Du Ik</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The United Nations Organization and its children's agency UNICEF withdrew their staff, saying that it wasn't sure the event would help its mission of raising awareness of conditions for children and amid concerns that the relay would be used as a propaganda stunt. &quot;It was unconscionable,&quot; said a UN official who was briefed on the arguments.

One day before the relay was to start, the official website appeared to have been updated to remove the disputed islands and dotted lines marking China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people protesting China were arrested in Hanoi prior to the rally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which blogger calling for demonstrations was arrested for tax evasion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Điếu Cày</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which torchbearer sent a letter of protest to the president of the International Olympic Committee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lê Minh Phiếu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many protesters were arrested in Hanoi prior to the rally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is blogger Điếu Cày's real name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nguyễn Văn Hải</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Though he urged for demonstrations in Vietnam, Nguyễn Văn Hải was charged with what crime?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tax evasion.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the torchbearer who wrote a letter to the IOC president about discrepancies on a website?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lê Minh Phiếu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was removed from the website that Lê Minh Phiếu had written about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disputed islands and dotted lines marking China's maritime claims</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre> Hong Kong: The event was held in Hong Kong on May 2. In the ceremony held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive Donald Tsang handed the torch to the first torchbearer, Olympic medalist Lee Lai Shan. The torch relay then traveled through Nathan Road, Lantau Link, Sha Tin (crossed Shing Mun River via a dragon boat, which had been never used before in the history of Olympic torch relays), Victoria Harbour (crossed by Tin Hau, a VIP vessel managed by the Marine Department) before ending in Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai. A total of 120 torchbearers were selected to participate in the event consisting of celebrities, athletes and pro-Beijing camp politicians. No politicians from the pro-democracy camp were selected as torchbearers. One torchbearer could not participate due to flight delay. It was estimated that more than 200,000 spectators came out and watched the relay. Many enthusiastic supporters wore red shirts and waved large Chinese flags. According to Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang, 3,000 police were deployed to ensure order.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the torch arrive in Hong Kong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first torchbearer in Hong Kong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lee Lai Shan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the torch event started in Hong Kong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hong Kong Cultural Centre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the torch relay end in Hong Kong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many torchbearers participated in the relay event in Hong Kong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">120</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the relay event held in Hong Kong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 2.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who handed the torch to Lee Lai Shan, the first torchbearer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Donald Tsang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was used to get the torch across the Shing Mun River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a dragon boat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many torchbearers carried the torch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">120</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The torchbearers included athletes, celebrities and who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pro-Beijing camp politicians.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There were several protests along the torch relay route. Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable plastic Olympic flames, which they said symbolised democracy. They wanted accountability for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying &quot;I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.&quot; Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like &quot;running dog,&quot; &quot;traitor,&quot; &quot;get out!,&quot; and &quot;I love the Communist Party.&quot; At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage. Onlookers were saying &quot;Aren't you Chinese?&quot; in Mandarin putonghua as they tried to cover the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag. One woman had an orange sign that said, &quot;Olympic flame for democracy&quot;, while a man carried a poster with a tank and the slogan &quot;One world, two dreams&quot;. A university student and former RDHK radio host Christina Chan wrapped the Tibetan snow lion flag around her body and later began waving it. Several onlookers heckled Chan, shouting &quot;What kind of Chinese are you?&quot; and &quot;What a shame!&quot; In the end, she and some of the protesters were taken away against their will by the authorities via a police vehicle &quot;for their own protection.&quot; Chan is currently[when?] suing the Hong Kong government, claiming her human rights were breached.

In response, Lee Cheuk Yan, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, said, &quot;It's outrageous that the government is willing to sacrifice the image of Hong Kong because of the torch relay.&quot; Hollywood actress Mia Farrow was also briefly questioned at the Hong Kong airport though officials allowed her to enter. She later gave a speech criticizing China's relations with Sudan in Hong Kong, as there was also a small minority of people protesting about China's role in the crisis of Darfur.

There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products. Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some burned French flags, some added Swastika (due to its conotaions with Nazism) to the French flag, and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy. Some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles. Hundreds of people joined Anti-French rallies in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao, which quickly spread to other cities like Xi'an, Harbin and Jinan. Carrefour denied any support or involvement in the Tibetan issue, and had its staff in its Chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the Chinese national flag and caps with Olympic insignia and as well as the words &quot;Beijing 2008&quot; to show its support for the games. The effort had to be ceased when the BOCOG deemed the use of official Olympic insignia as illegal and a violation of copyright.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which French company was boycotted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carrefour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Carrefour was boycotted because of which shareholder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">LVMH Group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the LVMH Group accused of supporting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dalai Lama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was burned during these boycotts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French flag</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was accused of helping the Dalai Lama?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">LVMH Group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Boycotters accused France of being pro-seccessionist and what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-Chinese racism.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In response to the demonstrations, the Chinese government attempted to calm the situation, possibly fearing the protests may spiral out of control as has happened in recent years, including the anti-Japanese protests in 2005.
