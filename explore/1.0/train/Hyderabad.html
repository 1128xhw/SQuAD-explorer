In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for 150 years, with the city serving as its capital. The Nizami influence can still be seen in the culture of the Hyderabadi Muslims. The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the President of India. In 2014, the newly formed state of Telangana split from Andhra Pradesh and the city became joint capital of the two states, a transitional arrangement scheduled to end by 2025.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Hyderabad established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Established in 1591</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the person that established Hyderabad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty controlled Hyderabad until the early 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Qutb Shahi dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Mughal viceroy created a dynasty in early 18th century Hyderabad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which dynasty did Asif Jah I create?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nizams of Hyderabad</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today, with the Charminar—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—coming to symbolise Hyderabad. Golconda fort is another major landmark. The influence of Mughlai culture is also evident in the city's distinctive cuisine, which includes Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from different parts of the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. While Hyderabad is losing its cultural pre-eminence, it is today, due to the Telugu film industry, the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which individual commissioned Chaminar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muhammad Quli Qutb </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Hyderabad become important culturally in India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mid-19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two groups had an influence in making Hyderabad a cultural center?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Qutb Shahis and Nizams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What culture is most represented in the food of Hyderabad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mughlai culture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hyderabad has India's second biggest film production industry, what is it called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Telugu film industry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the City of Pearls. Many of the city's traditional bazaars, including Laad Bazaar, Begum Bazaar and Sultan Bazaar, have remained open for centuries. However, industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian manufacturing, research and financial institutions, including Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, the National Geophysical Research Institute and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Special economic zones dedicated to information technology have encouraged companies from across India and around the world to set up operations and the emergence of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the 1990s led to the area's naming as India's &quot;Genome Valley&quot;.

It was named to honour the Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, who was also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battles. Andrew Petersen, a scholar of Islamic architecture, says the city was originally called Baghnagar (city of gardens). One popular theory suggests that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of the city, named it &quot;Bhagyanagar&quot; or &quot;Bhāgnagar&quot; after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl with whom he had fallen in love. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal. The city was renamed Hyderabad in her honour.

During this period, Alauddin Khilji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golkonda, to Delhi. Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty until 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau, with Gulbarga, 200 km (124 mi) west of Hyderabad, as its capital.

Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. The death of Asif Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability.

Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form the modern states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement, attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. The city suffered several explosions: one at Dilsukhnagar in 2002 claimed two lives; terrorist bombs in May and August 2007 caused communal tension and riots; and two bombs exploded in February 2013. On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state, and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill.

Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household songs based on local Folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Deccan region known for culturally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a tawaif?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">courtesan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of music is dholak ke geet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">songs based on local Folklore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What entity is responsible for the Taramati Music Festival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The state government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the rule of what two groups did dance and music from North India become popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Mughals and Nizams</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although the city is not particularly noted for theatre and drama, the state government promotes theatre with multiple programmes and festivals in such venues as the Ravindra Bharati, Shilpakala Vedika and Lalithakala Thoranam.

The remaining 8% include buses, goods vehicles and taxis. The large number of vehicles coupled with relatively low road coverage—roads occupy only 9.5% of the total city area:79—has led to widespread traffic congestion especially since 80% of passengers and 60% of freight are transported by road.:3 The Inner Ring Road, the Outer Ring Road, the Hyderabad Elevated Expressway, the longest flyover in India, and various interchanges, overpasses and underpasses were built to ease the congestion. Maximum speed limits within the city are 50 km/h (31 mph) for two-wheelers and cars, 35 km/h (22 mph) for auto rickshaws and 40 km/h (25 mph) for light commercial vehicles and buses.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2012 how many vehicles were driving in Hyderabad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3.5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the vehicles in Hyderabad were cars in 2012?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Hyderabad city was covered by roads in 2012?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 9.5% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2012 what percentage of Hyderabad freight was moved by road?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the maximum speed for buses in Hyderabad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">40 km/h (25 mph)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hyderabad sits at the junction of three National Highways linking it to six other states: NH-7 runs 2,369 km (1,472 mi) from Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, in the north to Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, in the south; NH-9, runs 841 km (523 mi) east-west between Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, and Pune, Maharashtra; and the 280 km (174 mi) NH-163 links Hyderabad to Bhopalpatnam, Chhattisgarh NH-765 links Hyderabad to Srisailam.
