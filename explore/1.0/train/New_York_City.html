In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the New York City Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants. According to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as well as New Jersey; the black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance. Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the mayor of New York City in 1861? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fernando Wood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the commutation fee to avoid being conscripted during the American Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$300</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">People of what ethnicity most visibly participated in the Draft Riots of 1863?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Irish </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many people died during the Draft Riots of 1863?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">120 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the approximate African-American population of New York City in 1865?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Draft Riots caused which building to burn down in 1863?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colored Orphan Asylum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.

The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In millimeters, how much precipitation does New York receive a year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,270</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In centimeters, what is the average winter snowfall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">66</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Hurricane Sandy strike New York?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 29, 2012</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many inches of precipitation does NYC get in a year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">49.9</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which natural disaster occurred on October 29, 2012 in NYC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hurricane Sandy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The mean snowfall between 1981 and 2010 in NYC has been how many inches?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25.8</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The City of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the New York City department that operates the park system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New York City Department of Parks and Recreation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the state office that operates New York City parks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What federal service operates New York City parks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Park Service</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New York City was the second best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities, behind the park system of Minneapolis.

The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu (Chinese: 朝鲜族) or Joseonjok (Hangul: 조선족)) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos, as well as Malaysians and other Southeast Asians; while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian as well as Asian Indian immigrants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What New York borough contains the highest population of Asian-Americans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What borough housed the first Chinatown in New York?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manhattan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of 2012, what percentage of the New York City population was ethnically Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6.3%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What borough is home to a large Tibetan population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the New York City population is Japanese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">0.3%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>New York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city.

Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which political party holds the majority of most office terms in NYC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Democrats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2008, what percentage of voters were democrats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">67</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which US president became the first to receive over 80 percent of NYC votes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barack Obama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the last year that a republican candidate won all four boroughs of NYC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1924</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which president won all of NYC in 1924?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calvin Coolidge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What party are most public officials of New York members of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Democratic Party</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In November 2008, how many New Yorkers were registered as Democrats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">67%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the last presidential election when a Republican won New York City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1924</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many boroughs did Barack Obama win in the 2012 presidential election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What political party was Calvin Coolidge a member of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Republican</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Much of the scientific research in the city is done in medicine and the life sciences.

Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s.
