Drawing inspiration from elements of punk rock while departing from its musical conventions and wider cultural affiliations, post-punk music was marked by varied, experimentalist sensibilities and its &quot;conceptual assault&quot; on rock tradition. Artists embraced electronic music, black dance styles and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists liberally drew on sources such as critical theory, cinema, performance art and modernist literature. Accompanying these musical developments were subcultures that produced visual art, multimedia performances, independent record labels and fanzines in conjunction with the music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is post-punk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heterogeneous type of rock music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did post-punk arrive on the scene?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the wake of the punk movement of the 1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did post-punk artists use in their music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">critical theory, cinema, performance art and modernist literature</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What began to spring up around the post-punk music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">independent record labels and fanzines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did post-punk take on rock and roll?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conceptual assault</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the original punk movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a name for a type of rock music that is extremely varied in sound?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Post-punk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What elements of punk rock did post-punk depart from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">musical conventions and wider cultural affiliations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subject matter does post-punk commonly mesh its musical sensibilities with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">art and politics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What developed along with the music developments of post-punk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subcultures </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The term &quot;post-punk&quot; was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into disparate areas. Many of these artists, initially inspired by punk's DIY ethic and energy, ultimately became disillusioned with the style and movement, feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula, rock convention and self-parody. They repudiated its populist claims to accessibility and raw simplicity, instead seeing an opportunity to break with musical tradition, subvert commonplaces and challenge audiences. Artists moved beyonds punk's focus on the concerns of a largely white, male, working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tropes, such as three-chord progressions and Chuck Berry-based guitar riffs. These artists instead defined punk as &quot;an imperative to constant change&quot;, believing that &quot;radical content demands radical form&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who coined the term post-punk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">journalists in the late 1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dis the new term, post-punk, cover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into disparate areas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What inspired early post-punk artists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">punk's DIY ethic and energy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did post-punk fall out of love with punk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">commercial formula, rock convention and self-parody</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the new post-punk artists believe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;radical content demands radical form&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the first to use the term &quot;post-punk&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">journalists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was &quot;post-punk&quot; first used to start describing artists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were many post-punk artists originally inspired by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">punk's DIY ethic and energy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many chords did standard punk songs typically use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did post-punk artists feel there was an imperative to constantly do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">change</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Though the music varied widely between regions and artists, the post-punk movement has been characterized by its &quot;conceptual assault&quot; on rock conventions and rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditionalist, hegemonic or rockist in favor of experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as dub, electronic music, disco, noise, jazz, krautrock, world music and the avant-garde. While post-punk musicians often avoided or intentionally obscured conventional influences, previous musical styles did serve as touchstones for the movement, including particular brands of glam, art rock and &quot;[the] dark undercurrent of '60s music&quot;.[nb 1] According to Reynolds, artists once again approached the studio as an instrument, using new recording methods and pursuing novel sonic territories. Author Matthew Bannister wrote that post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined &quot;rock as progressive, as art, as 'sterile' studio perfectionism ... by adopting an avant-garde aesthetic&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the things that post-punk really got into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">experimentation with production techniques</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are non-rock styles that post-punk used as inspiration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dub, electronic music, disco, noise, jazz, krautrock, world music and the avant-garde</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What aesthetic did Matthew Bannister associate with post-punk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">avant-garde</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What music did post-punk end to reject?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high cultural references of 1960s rock artists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As a movement, post-punk has been characterized by its conceptual assault on what conventions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rock </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does post-punk reject any of which are perceived as being traditionalist, hegemonic, or rockist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aesthetics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the foundational aspects post-punk is deeply favorable towards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">experimentation </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did post-punk artists once again approach the studio?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as an instrument</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What references did post-punk artists specifically reject of the 1960s rock artists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high cultural</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nicholas Lezard described post-punk as &quot;a fusion of art and music&quot;. The era saw the robust appropriation of ideas from literature, art, cinema, philosophy, politics and critical theory into musical and pop cultural contexts. Artists sought to refuse the common distinction between high and low culture and returned to the art school tradition found in the work of artists such as Captain Beefheart and David Bowie. Among major influences on a variety of post-punk artists were writers such as William S. Burroughs and J.G. Ballard, avant-garde political scenes such as Situationism and Dada, and intellectual movements such as postmodernism. Many artists viewed their work in explicitly political terms. Additionally, in some locations, the creation of post-punk music was closely linked to the development of efficacious subcultures, which played important roles in the production of art, multimedia performances, fanzines and independent labels related to the music. Many post-punk artists maintained an anti-corporatist approach to recording and instead seized on alternate means of producing and releasing music. Journalists also became an important element of the culture, and popular music magazines and critics became immersed in the movement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Nicholas Lezard describe post-punk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fusion of art and music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which artists were influential in post-punk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Captain Beefheart and David Bowie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which writers helped to influence the post-punk movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William S.

Music journalist and post-punk scholar Simon Reynolds has advocated that post-punk be conceived as &quot;less a genre of music than a space of possibility&quot;, suggesting that &quot;what unites all this activity is a set of open-ended imperatives: innovation; willful oddness; the willful jettisoning of all things precedented or 'rock'n'roll'&quot;.

Additionally, the accuracy of the term's chronological prefix &quot;post&quot; has been disputed, as various groups commonly labeled post-punk in fact predate the punk rock movement.

In 1978, the former band began a series of collaborations with British ambient pioneer and ex-Roxy Music member Brian Eno, experimenting with Dada-influenced lyrical techniques, dance music, and African polyrhythms.

Writers like Paul Morley began advocating &quot;overground brightness&quot; instead of the experimental sensibilities promoted in early years. Morley's own musical collaboration with engineer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik, the Art of Noise, would attempt to bring sampled and electronic sounds to the pop mainstream. A variety of more pop-oriented groups, including ABC, the Associates, Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow (the latter two managed by former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren) emerged in tandem with the development of the New Romantic subcultural scene.

The earliest sign of a revival was the emergence of various underground bands in the mid-'90s. However, the first commercially successful bands – the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, Neils Children and Editors – surfaced in the late 1990s to early 2000s, as did several dance-oriented bands such as the Rapture, Radio 4 and LCD Soundsystem. Additionally, some darker post-punk bands began to appear in the indie music scene in the 2010s, including Cold Cave, She Wants Revenge, Eagulls, the Soft Moon, She Past Away and Light Asylum, who were also affiliated with the darkwave revival, as well as A Place to Bury Strangers, who combined early post-punk and shoegaze. These bands tend to draw a fanbase who are a combination of the indie music subculture, older post-punk fans and the current goth subculture.
