True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early &quot;stem-birds&quot;, such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the last surviving dinosaurs, according o the fossil record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">birds </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did true birds first appear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cretaceous period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name an example of an early stem-bird.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Archaeopteryx</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moas and elephant birds.

Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have polygynous (&quot;many females&quot;) or, rarely, polyandrous (&quot;many males&quot;) breeding systems. Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilized through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilized, though unfertilized eggs do not produce offspring.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of birds are among the most intelligent animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">corvids and parrots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How to birds produce offspring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> by laying eggs which are fertilized through sexual reproduction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are eggs usually laid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nest </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many species of birds are economically important.

About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then.

However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds.

It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics, however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics. Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Birds live on how many continents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Highest bird diversity occurs in which regions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tropical </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some penguins have been recording diving up to how many feet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">980 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some seabird species only come ashore for what purpose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> to breed</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans.

Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when a bird's kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and secrete it as uric acid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">uricotelic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which bid has a urinary bladder or external urethral opening?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ostrich</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a multi-purpose opening on birds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cloaca </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do most birds mate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> by joining cloaca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What aids birds with flight?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rapid digestion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.

The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird's size.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Upon inhalation, what percentage of fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">75%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the other 25 percent of fresh air go?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">directly into the lungs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the syrinx?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sound production is achieved using what muscular chamber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">syrinx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which animal has one of the most complex respiratory system of all animal groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Birds </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The avian circulatory system is driven by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four-chambered, myogenic heart </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the heart contained in the avian circulatory system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fibrous pericardial sac</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What lubricates the pericardial sac?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> serous fluid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are Avian hearts larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allows more blood to be pumped</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are birds' arteries composed of thick elastic muscles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What moves through the arteries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blood </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is organized into capillary beds in tissues?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Capillaries </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the funneling that occurs that brings blood back to the heart?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vasodilation </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The nervous system is large relative to the bird's size.

Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones. This allows them to perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in courtship. Birds have specialized light-sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons.

Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from center outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is regularly moulted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Plumage </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;non-breeding&quot; plumage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How often does moulting occur in most species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">annual </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of birds may moult only once every few years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> large birds of prey</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to &quot;fly&quot; through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What distinguishes birds from almost all other vertebrate classes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Most birds can fly,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Flight </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many large flight muscles do birds have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Pectoralis account for what percentage of total mass of a bird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many extant bird species are flightless?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term used for birds that employ many strategies to obtain food?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">generalists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term used for birds that concentrate time and effort on specific food items?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">specialists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of birds have specially adapted brushy tongues?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nectar feeders </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some species, including frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, engage in kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds.

The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers.

These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs. Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi), although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi). Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi). Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do birds substantially increase body fats and reduce the size of some of their organs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Before migration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the flight range of landbirds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2,500 km (1,600 mi) </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the flight range of shoebirds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4,000 km (2,500 mi)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which bird is capable of non-stop flights of up to 6,300 miles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bar-tailed godwit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which birds often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability. Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory. Altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Australia, what percentage of non-passerine birds were partially migratory</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">44% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Australia, what percentage of passerine birds were partially migratory</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 32% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is most often triggered by temperature changes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Altitudinal migration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which family of birds are neither migratory or sedentary but considered to be dispersive, irruptive or nomadic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parrots</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales, within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi). Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock.

Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour.

Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight. It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight. Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators.

Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.

Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do birds usually lay their eggs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of birds lay its eggs on bare rock?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cliff-nesting common guillemot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do male emporer penguins keep eggs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between their body and feet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of bird nests are no more than a scrape on the ground?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">albatross </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process optimises temperature for chick development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Incubation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does incubation begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">after the last egg has been laid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of incubating birds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">brood patches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many days is the incubation period for woodpeckers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many days is the incubation period for kiwis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 80 days</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species.

At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched.

Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brood parasitism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bird species are obligate parasites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">One hundred </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of birds lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-obligate brood parasites</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviors, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway.

Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual’s fitness.
