The United Nations, with United States as the principal force, came to aid of South Korea. China, along with assistance from Soviet Union, came to aid of North Korea.

In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and—by agreement with the United States—occupied Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently occupied the south and Japan surrendered. By 1948, two separate governments had been set up. Both governments claimed to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950. On that day, the United Nations Security Council recognized this North Korean act as invasion and called for an immediate ceasefire. On 27 June, the Security Council adopted S/RES/83: Complaint of aggression upon the Republic of Korea and decided the formation and dispatch of the UN Forces in Korea. Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the defense of South Korea, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nation ruled Korea in 1910?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of Korea did the Soviet Union occupy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">north of the 38th parallel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who occupied Korea south of the 38th parallel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. forces</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What United Nation's committee considered the invasion of Korea to be an act of aggression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Nations Security Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many countries assisted in the defense of South Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Twenty-one</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the first two months of the conflict, South Korean forces were on the point of defeat, forced back to the Pusan Perimeter. In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Inchon, and cut off many of the North Korean attackers. Those that escaped envelopment and capture were rapidly forced back north all the way to the border with China at the Yalu River, or into the mountainous interior. At this point, in October 1950, Chinese forces crossed the Yalu and entered the war. Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces which continued until mid-1951. After these dramatic reversals of fortune, which saw Seoul change hands four times, the last two years of conflict became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive bombing campaign. Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their Communist allies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the beginning of the conflict, where were South Korean forces pushed back to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pusan Perimeter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1950, what country got involved in the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">China</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did the control of Seoul change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On land, where was the last two years of the war fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">close to the 38th parallel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of combat was seen for the first time in the history of war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">air-to-air combat</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In China, the war is officially called the &quot;War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea&quot; (simplified Chinese: 抗美援朝战争; traditional Chinese: 抗美援朝戰爭; pinyin: Kàngměiyuáncháo zhànzhēng), although the term &quot;Chaoxian (Korean) War&quot; (simplified Chinese: 朝鲜战争; traditional Chinese: 朝鮮戰爭; pinyin: Cháoxiǎn zhànzhēng) is also used in unofficial contexts, along with the term &quot;Korean Conflict&quot; (simplified Chinese: 韩战; traditional Chinese: 韓戰; pinyin: Hán Zhàn) more commonly used in regions such as Hong Kong and Macau.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In, China what is the war officially called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Macau and Hong Kong call the Korean War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Korean Conflict</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is the term 'Chaoxian War' used as a name for the Korean War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unofficial contexts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Korea was considered to be part of the Empire of Japan as an industrialized colony along with Taiwan, and both were part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Starting in 1939, the populace was required to use Japanese names under the Sōshi-kaimei policy.

This was incorporated into America's General Order No. 1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August. Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, &quot;even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U.S. forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement...we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops&quot;. He noted that he was &quot;faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area&quot;. As Rusk's comments indicate, the Americans doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this. Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of co-operation, and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What job were Colonels Dean Rusk and Charles H.

However, President Truman later acknowledged that he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) (declassified in 1975):</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Secretary of State did President Truman hold discussions about how the US would respond to the invasion of South Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dean Acheson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the US not want to see repeated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mistake of appeasement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The US involvement in the Korean War was important to achieving what goal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the global containment of communism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What report discussed the United States's goals for containing communism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Security Council Report 68</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The North Korean invasion of South Korea was compared to what event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adolf Hitler's aggressions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As an initial response, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only 'on paper', since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request. In fact, because of the extensive defense cuts and the emphasis placed on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were in a position to make a robust response with conventional military strength. General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was faced with re-organizing and deploying an American military force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart. The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as American troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions. Lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, they were driven back down the Korean peninsula to Pusan. In a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated that &quot;Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... [T]hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the US naval blockade not feasible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. Navy no longer had the warships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the US not able to provide an adequate response to the Korean invasion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">defense budget cutbacks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was tasked with reorganization and deploying of the US military?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Omar Bradley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was forced to retreat back to the Pusan Peninsula due to unpreparedness?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American troops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who stated that winning the war does not excuse putting US troops into a bad situation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Major General Floyd L.

KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night. To deny matériel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs.

The X Corps landed at Wonsan (in southeastern North Korea) and Riwon (in northeastern North Korea), already captured by ROK forces. The Eighth U.S. Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang city, the North Korean capital, on 19 October 1950. The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (&quot;Rakkasans&quot;) made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon. The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang; and to rescue American prisoners of war. At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war.

Mao then asked Peng to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the Chinese leaders.

The Chinese New Year's Offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to conquer Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Third Phase Offensive also known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese New Year's Offensive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why goals were accomplished the the KPA and PVA's use gongs during these attacks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did some UN troops react to the use of noise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the PVA and KPA gain by using the tactics during the Third Phase Offensive</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Seoul </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was commanding the U.S. Eight Army at the time of the Third Phase Offensive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lieutenant-General Matthew Ridgway</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>UN forces retreated to Suwon in the west, Wonju in the center, and the territory north of Samcheok in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held.

But the offensive was soon blunted by the IX Corps positions at Chipyong-ni in the center. Units of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and the French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum. The battle is sometimes known as the Gettysburg of the Korean War. The battle saw 5,600 Korean, American and French troops defeat a numerically superior Chinese force. Surrounded on all sides, the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division Warrior Division's 23rd Regimental Combat Team with an attached French Battalion was hemmed in by more than 25,000 Chinese Communist forces.

Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but that they had nothing to eat, no bullets to shoot, and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply, but these efforts were never completely sufficient. At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the Chinese Air Force began to participate in the war from September 1951 onward.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Stalin send two air forces divisions and other assistance to the Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Chinese war effort</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What issues plagued the PVA throughout the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">logistical problems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a great concern of many Chinese troops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they had nothing to eat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Zhou's ineffective response to the issue plaguing the PVA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did China introduce to the war in 1951?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Chinese Air Force </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman relieved the controversial General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Korea. There were several reasons for the dismissal. MacArthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed that whether or not to use nuclear weapons should be his own decision, not the President's. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution. MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution. A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was relieved from his duties as Commander in Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General MacArthur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did not have faith in MacArthur's claim that victory was the only respectable outcome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Truman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mistake did MacArthur make regarding the 38th parallel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Chinese would not enter the war</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Truman want to see happen in Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a truce and orderly withdrawal </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose involvement in the war was found to be in violation of the Constitution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">.

The United Nations Command, supported by the United States, the North Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, signed the Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953 to end the fighting. The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks.

A North Korean tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion. These drove against a ROK Army with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the Soviet T-34s. Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed. The North Korean tanks had a good deal of early successes against South Korean infantry, elements of the 24th Infantry Division, and those United States built M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered. Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing Korean armor. The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including M4A3 Sherman medium tanks backed by U.S. M26 heavy tanks, along with the British Centurion, Churchill, and Cromwell tanks.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What form of attack was an effective measure of slowing Korean armor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ground attack aircraft </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What weapon did the the KPA use that was successful early in the Korean conflict?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet T-34-85 tanks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What helped the UN forces and shifted the war in their favor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the North Koreans suffered major tank losses </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What actions of the UN also helped them improve their results during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he UN forces brought heavier equipment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many tanks were in the North Korean tank corps?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">120</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because neither Korea had a significant navy, the Korean War featured few naval battles.

USS Juneau later sank several ammunition ships that had been present. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship PC-703 sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon.

These arrived in December 1950. The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor. It had a very high service ceiling—50,000 feet (15,000 m) and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons. They were fast enough to dive past the fighter escort of P-80 Shooting Stars and F9F Panthers and could reach and destroy the U.S. heavy bombers. B-29 losses could not be avoided, and the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the necessarily less accurate nighttime bombing of targets. The MiGs were countered by the F-86 Sabres. They had a ceiling of 42,000 feet (13,000 m) and were armed with six .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, which were range adjusted by radar gunsights. If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG. Once in a level flight dogfight, both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 660 mph (1,100 km/h). The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What plane did the US send to Korea to counter the power of the MiG-15?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">F-86 Sabre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To mitigate the loses of the B-29, what did the US Air Force do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the necessarily less accurate nighttime bombing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the MiG designed to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> bomber interceptor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
