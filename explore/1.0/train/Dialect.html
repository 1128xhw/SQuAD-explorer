In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a &quot;dialect,&quot; as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of social or political status, official status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, the &quot;dialects&quot; subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often related) languages in and of themselves. For example, most of the various regional Romance languages of Italy, often colloquially referred to as Italian &quot;dialects,&quot; are, in fact, not actually derived from modern standard Italian, but rather evolved from Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy. These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly &quot;dialects&quot; of the standard Italian language, but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed, generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents. These variations on standard Italian, known as regional Italian, would more appropriately be called &quot;dialects&quot; in accordance with the first linguistic definition of &quot;dialect,&quot; as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian. </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the other definition of the term dialect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does a dialect stand in relation to the standard language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subordinate to the standard language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The regional Romance languages in what country are sometimes referred to as dialects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are 20th century variations on standard Italian called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">regional Italian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what language did the regional Romance languages of Italy derive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation (phonology, including prosody).

Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutual unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan, Catalan, or French speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have an greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related Neapolitan language, but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the same island as the Sicilian language.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a major reason why the Latin-based regional Romance languages of Italy should be regarded as independent languages rather than dialects of each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they lack mutual intelligibility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what region of Italy does the Eastern Lombard dialect hail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lombardy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language family does Eastern Lombard belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gallo-Italic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of language is Sicilian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neapolitan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language was spoken by Lombard immigrants to Sicily?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sicilian Gallo-Italic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived Florentine Tuscan language.

Although the written characters remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions has developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including Xiang, Wu, Gan, Min, Yue (Cantonese), and Hakka often show traces of Old Chinese or Middle Chinese. From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (dialects). Cantonese is still the most commonly used language in Hong Kong, Macau and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas Southern Min has been accepted in Taiwan as an important local language along with Mandarin.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what did Chinese characters derive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">logograms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for the Yue language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cantonese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hakka is a language from what geographic part of China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the south</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From the time of the Ming dynasty, what city was the capital of China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beijing </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At its founding. what was the official language of the Republic of China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Standard Mandarin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many historical linguists view any speech form as a dialect of the older medium of communication from which it developed.[citation needed] This point of view sees the modern Romance languages as dialects of Latin, modern Greek as a dialect of Ancient Greek, Tok Pisin as a dialect of English, and North Germanic as dialects of Old Norse. This paradigm is not entirely problem-free. It sees genetic relationships as paramount: the &quot;dialects&quot; of a &quot;language&quot; (which itself may be a &quot;dialect&quot; of a yet older language) may or may not be mutually intelligible.

Drawing from such concepts as the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European, linguists[who?] developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.[citation needed] Researchers at the International Auxiliary Language Association extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary. In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects. This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand. It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language could all Western languages be considered dialects of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Interlingua</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Researchers at what organization study and develop Interlingua?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">International Auxiliary Language Association</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nationality of high school students who learned Interlingua in a notable linguistic experiment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Swedish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Italian and Spanish, what language could Swedish Interlingua learners translate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portuguese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Standard Average European, from what concept was Interlingua derived?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the international scientific vocabulary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
