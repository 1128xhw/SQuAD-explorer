Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures, as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight. Daylighting (using windows, skylights, or light shelves) is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings. This can save energy in place of using artificial lighting, which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings. Proper lighting can enhance task performance, improve the appearance of an area, or have positive psychological effects on occupants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used a main source of light for a building during the day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daylighting </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of effects can natural illumination have on a persons psychological?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">positive </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Using natural illumination instead of artificial light sources help with what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">energy consumption</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Lamps and light fixtures are a form of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">artificial light sources </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The use of light to achieve an aesthetic effect is know as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lighting or illumination</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be used a main source of light for a building during the day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daylighting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Lamps and light fixtures  are a form of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lighting </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of effects can proper lighting have on a persons psychologically?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">positive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does using natural illumination instead of artificial lighting help with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">energy consumption</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the used to achieve a practical effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lighting or illumination</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Indoor lighting is usually accomplished using light fixtures, and is a key part of interior design.

Hundreds of these lamps (hollow worked stones) have been found in the Lascaux caves in modern-day France, dating to about 15,000 years ago. Oily animals (birds and fish) were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick. Fireflies have been used as lighting sources. Candles and glass and pottery lamps were also invented.

It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer.

While lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption, expressed in watts, proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced. For example, a 60 W incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 W compact fluorescent lamp. Each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light. Visible light output is typically measured in lumens. This unit only quantifies the visible radiation, and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light. A wax candle produces on the close order of 13 lumens, a 60 watt incandescent lamp makes around 700 lumens, and a 15-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces about 800 lumens, but actual output varies by specific design. Rating and marketing emphasis is shifting away from wattage and towards lumen output, to give the purchaser a directly applicable basis upon which to select a lamp.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light bulb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a light bulb convert into electromagnetic radiation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electrical energy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Huge much light does a 13 W compact fluorescent lamp produce equivalent to a incandescent light bulb.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60 w</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many lemuns does a 15 watt fluorescent lamp produce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">800 lumens</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lighting design as it applies to the built environment is known as 'architectural lighting design'.

More critical or optimized designs now routinely use mathematical modeling on a computer using software such as Radiance which can allow an Architect to quickly undertake complex calculations to review the benefit of a particular design.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is designing as it applies to built environments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">architectural lighting design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Would you consider aesthetic elements alone in architectural lighting design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the software sometimes used to help calculate lighting needs in a built environment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Radiance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hand-calculations are based off of what type of data?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tabular</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of factor calculation can be used to find out how much daylight is received in a internal space.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daylight factor calculation.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In some design instances, materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect&lt; for example dark paint tends to absorb light, making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is, whereas light paint does the opposite.

The human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum, therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light. The basic SI unit of measurement is the candela (cd), which describes the luminous intensity, all other photometric units are derived from the candela. Luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2). The CGS unit of luminance is the stilb, which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2.

It could be stored indefinitely, unlike whale oil, which would eventually spoil. The American petroleum boom began in the 1850s. By the end of the decade there were 30 kerosene plants operating in the United States. The cheaper, more efficient fuel began to drive whale oil out of the market. John D.

A downside is still the initial cost, which is higher than that of compact fluorescent lamps.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much more power does a standard incandescent bulb use compared to LED?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average lifetime of a CFL?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average lifetime of a CFL?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50,000 hours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much power does a halogen lamp save compared to a standard blub?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Light pollution is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs, houses, and buildings. Polluting light is often wasted light involving unnecessary energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Light pollution is described as artificial light that is excessive or intrudes where it is not wanted. Well-designed lighting sends light only where it is needed without scattering it elsewhere. Poorly designed lighting can also compromise safety. For example, glare creates safety issues around buildings by causing very sharp shadows, temporarily blinding passersby making them vulnerable to would-be assailants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is known as artificial light that is excessive or intrusive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Light pollution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes sharp shadows around buildings? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glare</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From a military standpoint, lighting is a critical part of the battlefield conditions. Shadows are good places to hide, while bright areas are more exposed.

If natural light is not present searchlights and flares can be used.
