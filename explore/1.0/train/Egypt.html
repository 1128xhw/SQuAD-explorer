Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide. Egypt's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, having endured, and at times assimilated, various foreign influences, including Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman, and European. Although Christianised in the first century of the Common Era, it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the seventh century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far back does Egypt's history date back?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tenth millennium BC </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is Egypt considered a cradle of civilisation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were some of Egypt's foreign influences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman, and European</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are iconic monumuents of Egypt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century were islamic conquests of Egypt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seventh century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With over 90 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab World, the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world.

During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade.

A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the Semitic Hyksos. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris.

Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, most of them being boys. Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform and distribution, the dramatic growth in university education, and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66, overall public school enrolments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.
