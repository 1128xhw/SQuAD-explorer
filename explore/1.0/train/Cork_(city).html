Cork achieved an urban character at some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman (Viking) settlers founded a trading port. It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was thought to have founded Cork?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint Finbarr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Cork believed to have been founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Viking travelers establish a trading post in Cork?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">some point between 915 and 922</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of settlement was Cork?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ecclesiastical </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Norsemen provide to the monastery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">otherwise unobtainable trade goods</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted &quot;Black Rent&quot; from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the Barony of Cork City; it now takes in much of the neighbouring Barony of Cork.

The medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the Black Death arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England. The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. The title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318, and the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent Mayor by Queen Victoria on her Royal visit to the city.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who controlled Cork's municipal government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12–15 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many citizens were origionally in Cork?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 2,100 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the deaths of half of Cork's citizens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Black Death</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the plague hit Cork?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1349 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to recruit citizens of Cork to overthrow Henry VII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Perkin Warbeck</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The climate of Cork, like the rest of Ireland, is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes.

The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself.

Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter.

The General Post Office, with its limestone façade, is on Oliver Plunkett Street, on the site of the Theatre Royal which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840. The English circus proprietor Pablo Fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850, which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877.  The Grand Parade is a tree-lined avenue, home to offices, shops and financial institutions.
