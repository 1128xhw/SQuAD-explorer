They included nonconformists like the Puritans, who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England. Despite a common background, the groups' views on religious toleration were mixed. While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches. The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship, though enforcement was sparse. Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons: the established Church was responsible for poverty relief, putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the reason early immigrant groups came to America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to worship freely</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Protestant Christians fleeing from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious persecution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was persecuting the Puritans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> King of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did William Penn ensure the protection of in his colony?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious minorities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony both establish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">churches</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>^Note 2: in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows: &quot;Article IV.

On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended &quot;Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.&quot; After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of &quot;total separation of the church from the state.&quot; &quot; &quot;Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States,&quot; Madison wrote, and he declared, &quot;practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.&quot; In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded, &quot;We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings &amp; Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt.&quot; Madison's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States, as well as the Federal Government, from an establishment of religion, but the House did not pass them.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose conceptions of separation have long been argued over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jefferson and James Madison's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Jefferson refuse to issue, when it was sent to him by Congress during his presidency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Proclamations of Thanksgiving</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did both Jefferson and Madison attend religious services?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at the Capitol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many religious proclamations did Madison issue while President?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is essential to the purity of both religion and civil government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">practical distinction</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jefferson's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature.

Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many prongs is the Supreme COurt's test to determine if a government action comports with the Establishment Clause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the three-pronged test regarding the Establishment Clause know as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Lemon Test&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To not violate the Establishment Clause, a law must be adopted with neutral or what purpose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-religious</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What much the primary effect of a law neither advance or inhibit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Excessive entanglement occurs when a state policy results in a close relationship of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">government with religion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2002, a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional, even when students were not compelled to recite it, due to the inclusion of the phrase &quot;under God.&quot; In reaction to the case, Elk Grove Unified School District v.

Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths, even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What position do Jeffries and Ryan argue was the reason for support from a coalition of separationists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no-aid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of secularism came to dominate American public life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pervasive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supported the ban against government aid to religious schools before 1970?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most Protestants (and most Jews)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What diminished after 1980?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-Catholic sentiment </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strict separationism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Critics of the modern concept of the &quot;separation of church and state&quot; argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it.

Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state, allowing a variety of religions to flourish. Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions, Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a &quot;remarkable religiosity&quot; in the United States that isn't present in other industrialized nations. Wood believes that the U.S. operates on &quot;a sort of civic religion,&quot; which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who &quot;expects better of us.&quot; Beyond that, individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience. He calls this approach the &quot;genius of religious sentiment in the United States.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does having no state-run or state-established allow a variety of religions to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flourish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who has argued the United States is a model for the world in separation of church and state is a good thing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert S.
