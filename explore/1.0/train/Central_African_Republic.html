After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders; by the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993. Ange-Félix Patassé became president, but was later removed by General François Bozizé in the 2003 coup. The Central African Republic Bush War began in 2004 and, despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011, fighting broke out between various factions in December 2012, leading to ethnic and religious cleansing of the Muslim minority and massive population displacement in 2013 and 2014.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who established CAR's borders?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country ruled CAR as a colony?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did CAR become independent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in 1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first democratically elected President?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ange-Félix Patassé</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion is a minority in CAR?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim minority</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Approximately 10,000 years ago, desertification forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled and began farming as part of the Neolithic Revolution. Initial farming of white yam progressed into millet and sorghum, and before 3000 BC the domestication of African oil palm improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations. Bananas arrived in the region and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of alcoholic beverages.[when?] This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a &quot;Fish-stew Revolution&quot;, in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods. Products were often moved in ceramic pots, which are the first known examples of artistic expression from the region's inhabitants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long ago did people start living in the area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Approximately 10,000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agricultural job did people settling in the area perform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> farming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What vegetation helped populations expand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> African oil palm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was an imported food that provided most of the carbohydrates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bananas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What important protein helped with expansion of the inhabitants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the 16th and 17th centuries slave traders began to raid the region as part of the expansion of the Saharan and Nile River slave routes.

Within a year, he declared the establishment of the Central African Republic and served as the country's first prime minister. MESAN continued to exist, but its role was limited. After Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, David Dacko, took control of MESAN and became the country's first president after the CAR had formally received independence from France. Dacko threw out his political rivals, including former Prime Minister and Mouvement d'évolution démocratique de l'Afrique centrale (MEDAC), leader Abel Goumba, whom he forced into exile in France. With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the overwhelming amount of votes MESAN captured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many seats did MESAN win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">every legislative seat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was elected president of the Grand Council?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boganda</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Boganda die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a plane crash</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took over after Boganda died?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his cousin, David Dacko</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives.

After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a &quot;Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République&quot; (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a &quot;Mixed Electoral Commission&quot;, which included representatives from all political parties.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was inspired by the fall of the Berlin wall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a pro-democracy movement </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What large country pressured CAR to hold elections?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were free elections held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> October 1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who helped with the Free Elections?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UN Office of Electoral Affairs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What excuse did Kolingba use to deny the election results?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alleged irregularities</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR, Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%.

In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996) the Peace Corps evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon. To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic. The Bangui Agreements, signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997.
