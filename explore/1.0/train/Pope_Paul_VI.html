Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini automatically became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On What date was Pope Paul VI born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 26 September 1897 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Pope Paul VI die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 August 1978)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Pope Paul VI close the Second Vatican Counsel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Pope Paul VI elected as Pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 21 June 1963</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Pope Paul VI's first name at birth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Giovanni</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI (the first to take the name &quot;Paul&quot; since 1605) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the example of Apostle St. Paul.[citation needed] He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a Marian devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of devotee was Pope Paul VI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marian </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name had not been used for a Pope since the year 1605?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Paul&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the name &quot;Paul&quot; last used as a pontifical name before Pope Paul VI became Pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1605</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Pope Paul VI re-convene when he became Pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Second Vatican Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What publication promoted Pope Paul VI's views on abortion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">encyclical Humanae vitae</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Giovanni Battista Montini was born in the village of Concesio, in the province of Brescia, Lombardy in 1897.

Published by his order in January 1976 was a homily Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions concerning Sexual Ethics, which outlawed pre or extra-marital sex, condemned homosexuality, and forbade masturbation. It provoked French author and former diplomat Roger Peyrefitte, in an interview published by the magazine Tempo, to accuse Montini of hypocrisy, and of having a longtime lover who was a movie actor. According to rumors prevalent both inside the Curia and in Italian society, this was Paolo Carlini, who had a bit part as a hairdresser in the Audrey Hepburn film Roman Holiday. Peyrefitte had previously published the accusation in two books, but the interview (previously published in a French gay magazine) brought the rumors to a wider public and caused an uproar. In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St. Peters Square on April 18, Montini called the charges &quot;horrible and slanderous insinuations&quot; and appealed for prayers on his behalf. Special prayers for Montini were said in all Italian Roman Catholic churches in &quot;a day of consolation&quot;.

This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II, when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices. Priestly celibacy is considered a discipline rather than dogma, and some had expected that it might be relaxed. In response to these questions, the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church. The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 June 1967, confirms the traditional Church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests. Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society. The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood. However, during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state, a position which was drastically reversed by John Paul II in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 Canon Law that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is considered an ideal state for priests in the Catholic church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Celibacy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is seen as symbolizing the reality of living in the modern world as Roman Catholic priest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Celibacy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What document  of 1967 promotes the church's stance of celibacy in the priesthood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sacerdotalis caelibatus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of law locked down the Catholic church's stance on celibacy in the priesthood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Canon Law issued affirming celibacy in the priesthood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1983</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Of his eight encyclicals, Pope Paul VI is best known for his encyclical Humanae vitae (Of Human Life, subtitled On the Regulation of Birth), published on 25 July 1968.

They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons create a new person materially, while God completes the creation by adding the soul. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of Humanae vitae that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator. This divine partnership, according to Paul VI, does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage: marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships. The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as biology, psychology, demography or sociology. The reason for this, according to Paul VI, is that married love takes its origin from God, who &quot;is love&quot;.

In Colombia, Cardinal archbishop Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared, if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent. The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences, but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies.

The separated brothers and sisters, as he called them, were not able to contribute to the Council as invited observers. After the Council, many of them took initiative to seek out their Catholic counterparts and the Pope in Rome, who welcomed such visits. But the Catholic Church itself recognized from the many previous ecumenical encounters, that much needed to be done within, to be an open partner for ecumenism. To those who are entrusted the highest and deepest truth and therefore, so Paul VI, believed that he had the most difficult part to communicate. Ecumenical dialogue, in the view of Paul VI, requires from a Catholic the whole person: one's entire reason, will, and heart. Paul VI, like Pius XII before him, was reluctant to give in on a lowest possible point. And yet, Paul felt compelled to admit his ardent Gospel-based desire to be everything to everybody and to help all people Being the successor of Peter, he felt the words of Christ, &quot;Do you love me more&quot; like a sharp knife penetrating to the marrow of his soul.

On the religious side, it was agreed to share together in the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, to be held every year. The joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all Christians. On 19 July 1968, the meeting of the World Council of Churches took place in Uppsala, Sweden, which Pope Paul called a sign of the times.

In his will, he requested to be buried in the &quot;true earth&quot; and therefore, he does not have an ornate sarcophagus but an in-ground grave.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Paul VI live for after experiencing a massive heart attack in 1978?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> three hours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what time did Paul VI die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21:41</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what day did Paul VI die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 August</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where did Paul VI conduct mass on the day of his death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> bed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What residence was the Paul VI staying in on the day of his death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Castel Gandolfo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the six consistories, Paul VI continued the internationalization policies started by Pius XII in 1946 and continued by John XXIII. In his 1976 consistory, five of twenty cardinals originated from Africa, one of them a son of a tribal chief with fifty wives. Several prominent Latin Americans like Eduardo Francisco Pironio of Argentina; Luis Aponte Martinez of Puerto Rico and Eugênio de Araújo Sales and Aloisio Lorscheider from Brazil were also elevated by him. There were voices within the Church at the time saying that the European period of the Church was coming to a close, a view shared by Britain's Cardinal Basil Hume. At the same time, the members of the College of Cardinals lost some of their previous influences, after Paul VI decreed, that not only cardinals but also bishops too may participate in committees of the Roman Curia. The age limit of eighty years imposed by the Pope, a numerical increase of Cardinals by almost 100%, and a reform of the regal vestments of the &quot;Princes of the Church&quot; further contributed to a service-oriented perception of Cardinals under his pontificate. The increased number of Cardinals from the Third World and the papal emphasis on related issues was nevertheless welcomed by many in Western Europe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many cardinals were from Africa in 1976?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> five </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did Cardinal Eduardo Francisco Pironi represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Argentina</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did Cardinal Araujo Sales represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brazil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group's committees did Paul VI declare both bishops and cardinals could participate in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Roman Curia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of clothing did Paul VI enact reform on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">regal vestments</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Paul VI did renounce many traditional symbols of the papacy and the Catholic Church; some of his changes to the papal dress were reversed by Pope Benedict XVI in the early 21st century. Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries, he got rid of them. He became the first pope to visit five continents. Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the Euro-centric Church into a Church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened. His 6 August 1967 motu proprio Pro Comperto Sane opened the Roman Curia to the bishops of the world. Until then, only Cardinals could be leading members of the Curia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of theatrical uniforms did Paul VI eradicate from the Vatican?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">army </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first pope to visit five continents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul VI</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Paul Vi turn the focus of the church toward during his papacy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of clergy did Paul VI include in Vatican decision making that had previously been denied influence in this realm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bishops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What papal statement under Paul VI opened the Vatican doors to global influences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> motu proprio Pro Comperto Sane</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
