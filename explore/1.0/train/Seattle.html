By 1910, Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country. However, the Great Depression severely damaged the city's economy. Growth returned during and after World War II, due partially to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s, with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region. In 1994 the Internet retail giant Amazon was founded in Seattle. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what golden event was Seattle the portal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Klondike Gold Rush</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which large technology giant established its home base in Seattle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Microsoft </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what area was the Klondike Gold Rush located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alaska</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Seattle's first primary money maker?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Logging</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the airplane company that helped Seattle return to economic stability? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boeing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Seattle (i/siˈætəl/) is a West Coast seaport city and the seat of King County. With an estimated 662,400 residents as of 2015[update], Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. In July 2013 it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States, and remained in the top five in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%. The Seattle metropolitan area of around 3.6 million inhabitants is the 15th largest metropolitan area in the United States. The city is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canada–United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the third largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of which Washington county is Seattle the center?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King County</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By 2015 what was Seattle's population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">662,400</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Seattle's ranking in North America in terms of container processing? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> third largest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what time was Seattle the most rapidly growing city in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far away is the Canadian border from Seattle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100 miles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After a difficult winter, most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day Pioneer Square.

The town of Seattle was disincorporated January 18, 1867 and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869 with a Mayor-council government.

(During this period the road now known as Yesler Way won the nickname &quot;Skid Road&quot;, supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to Henry Yesler's sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row.) Like much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management, as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886. This violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma). In 1900, Asians were 4.2% of the population. Authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the industry source that produced Seattle's first financial vigor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lumber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name was given to the street Yesler Way?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Skid Road</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After Yesler Way fell into ill refute, what was the term generally used for this type of decline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Skid Row</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the Seattle population was Asian in 1900?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4.2%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What events occurred in 1885-1886 due to racial disputes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-Chinese riots</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the Klondike Gold Rush, which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893; in a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the S.S. Portland docked with its famed &quot;ton of gold&quot;, and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Few of those working men found lasting wealth, however; it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like Everett, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton, and Olympia, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than mother lodes for extraction, of precious metals. The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company (later UPS). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer. Seattle brought in the Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After lumbering, what was Seattle's second big economic boom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Klondike Gold Rush</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event ended the Gold Rush?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">depression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the start of the depression that stopped the Gold Rush?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Panic of 1893</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For whom was Seattle the main port of supply ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">miners</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company did James E.

Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747.

Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of theater did Alexander Pantages start in Seattle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vaudeville</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Pantages open his movie houses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1902</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Pantages competitor in the theater business?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Considine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the architect who built a number of theaters in the Seattle area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">B.

The Wallingford, Mount Baker, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt.

Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway, in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion.

From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the Link Light Rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington is scheduled to open in 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north, Des Moines to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023. Former mayor Michael McGinn has supported building light rail from downtown to Ballard and West Seattle.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what type of transportation system has Seattle begun to focus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mass transit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what kind of transportation has Seattle been moving away?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">automobile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What measure was passed by Seattle voters in 2006?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RapidRide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year do plans call for the completion of a rail line to Bellevue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2023</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which former mayor backed the expansion of rail lines from downtown to Ballard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Michael McGinn</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
