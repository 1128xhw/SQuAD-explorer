The city is named after the Christian saint, Monica. Situated on Santa Monica Bay, it is bordered on three sides by the city of Los Angeles – Pacific Palisades to the north, Brentwood on the northeast, Sawtelle on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and Venice on the south. Santa Monica is well known for its affluent single-family neighborhoods but also has many neighborhoods consisting primarily of condominiums and apartments. Over two-thirds of Santa Monica's residents are renters. The Census Bureau population for Santa Monica in 2010 was 89,736.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of city is Santa Monica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">beachfront </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of Los Angeles County is it located in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">western</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Santa Monica named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian saint, Monica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many residents of Santa Monica rent their property?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two-thirds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population in 2010 according to the Census Bureau?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">89,736</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Santa Monica was long inhabited by the Tongva people. Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portolà, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4. Another version says that it was named by Juan Crespí on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs (Serra Springs), that were reminiscent of the tears that Saint Monica shed over her son's early impiety.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did indigenous people that lived in Santa Monica call it previously?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kecheek </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the local population called indigenous to the Santa Monica Area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tongva</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first explorers name that came in contact with the natives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gaspar de Portolà</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date did the explorer reach Santa Monica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 3, 1769</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What day is the Santa Monica Feast held on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> May 4</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Around the start of the 20th century, a growing population of Asian Americans lived in or near Santa Monica and Venice.

It is located in USDA plant hardiness zone 11a. Because of its location, nestled on the vast and open Santa Monica Bay, morning fog is a common phenomenon in May, June and early July (caused by ocean temperature variations and currents). Like other inhabitants of the greater Los Angeles area, residents have a particular terminology for this phenomenon: the &quot;May Gray&quot; and the &quot;June Gloom&quot;. Overcast skies are common during June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon. In the late winter/early summer, daily fog is a phenomenon too. It happens suddenly and it may last some hours or past sunset time. Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures. At times, the sun can be shining east of 20th Street, while the beach area is overcast. As a general rule, the beach temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 6 degrees Celsius) cooler than it is inland during summer days, and 5–10 degrees warmer during winter nights.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Roughly how many days of sunshine does Santa Monica get annually? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">310</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What USDA hardiness zone is Santa Monica located in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11a</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What commonly occurs on the mornings in May?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fog</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have locals coined the morning time in May?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;May Gray&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the beach temperature in Fahrenheit during the summer ? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 to 10 degrees</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Santa Monica is one of the most environmentally activist municipalities in the nation.

The Santa Monica Freeway between Santa Monica and downtown Los Angeles has the distinction of being one of the busiest highways in all of North America. After traversing Los Angeles County, I-10 crosses seven more states, terminating at Jacksonville, Florida. In Santa Monica, there is a road sign designating this route as the Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway. State Route 2 (Santa Monica Boulevard) begins in Santa Monica, barely grazing State Route 1 at Lincoln Boulevard, and continues northeast across Los Angeles County, through the Angeles National Forest, crossing the San Gabriel Mountains as the Angeles Crest Highway, ending in Wrightwood. Santa Monica is also the western (Pacific) terminus of historic U.S. Route 66. Close to the eastern boundary of Santa Monica, Sepulveda Boulevard reaches from Long Beach at the south, to the northern end of the San Fernando Valley. Just east of Santa Monica is Interstate 405, the &quot;San Diego Freeway&quot;, a major north-south route in Los Angeles County and Orange County, California.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the Santa Monica Freeway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Interstate 10</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What road does state route 2 begin on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Santa Monica Boulevard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many more states aside from California does the interstate 10 run through?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven more</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city and state does the interstate 10 end at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jacksonville, Florida</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the Santa Monica Freeway begin around?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pacific Ocean</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historical aspects of the Expo line route are noteworthy. It uses the right-of-way for the Santa Monica Air Line that provided electric-powered freight and passenger service between Los Angeles and Santa Monica beginning in the 1920s. Service was discontinued in 1953 but diesel-powered freight deliveries to warehouses along the route continued until March 11, 1988. The abandonment of the line spurred concerns within the community and the entire right-of-way was purchased from Southern Pacific by Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The line was built in 1875 as the steam-powered Los Angeles and Independence Railroad to bring mining ore to ships in Santa Monica harbor and as a passenger excursion train to the beach.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beginning in what decade did the Santa Monica  Expo Air Line host freight and passenger services?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1920s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Santa Monica freight and passenger service stop running?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1953</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Diesel powered freight deliveries continued through what date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 11, 1988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the result from the discontinuation of using the line for deliveries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> was purchased</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought the Expo line from Southern Pacific?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Southern Pacific by Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2006, crime in Santa Monica affected 4.41% of the population, slightly lower than the national average crime rate that year of 4.48%.

These per-capita crime rates are computed based on Santa Monica's full-time population of about 85,000.

They then ran outside to a getaway vehicle driven by a third Culver City gang member, who is now also in custody. The clothing store was believed to be a local hang out for Santa Monica gang members. The dead included two men from Northern California who had merely been visiting the store's owner, their cousin, to see if they could open a similar store in their area.

The Sylvester Stallone film Rocky III (1982) shows Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed training to fight Clubber Lang by running on the Santa Monica Beach, and Stallone's Demolition Man (1993) includes Santa Monica settings. Henry Jaglom's indie Someone to Love (1987), the last film in which Orson Welles appeared, takes place in Santa Monica's venerable Mayfair Theatre. Heathers (1989) used Santa Monica's John Adams Middle School for many exterior shots. The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs (1996) is set entirely in Santa Monica, particularly the Palisades Park area, and features a radio station that resembles KCRW at Santa Monica College. 17 Again (2009) was shot at Samohi. Other films that show significant exterior shots of Santa Monica include Fletch (1985), Species (1995), Get Shorty (1995), and Ocean's Eleven (2001). Richard Rossi's biopic Aimee Semple McPherson opens and closes at the beach in Santa Monica.
