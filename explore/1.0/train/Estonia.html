By the thirteenth century Estonia consisted of the following provinces: Revala, Harjumaa, Saaremaa, Hiiumaa, Läänemaa, Alempois, Sakala, Ugandi, Jogentagana, Soopoolitse, Vaiga, Mõhu, Nurmekund, Järvamaa and Virumaa.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did political subgroups begin to appear in Estonia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">first centuries AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subdivision was associated with the province?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kihelkond</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subdivision was associated with the land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">maakond</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of structure did most provinces have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fortress</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commanded the defense of an area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The king or other highest administrative official elder</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Oeselians or Osilians (Estonian saarlased; singular: saarlane) were a historical subdivision of Estonians inhabiting Saaremaa (Danish: Øsel; German: Ösel; Swedish: Ösel), an Estonian island in the Baltic Sea.

Among the casualties of this raid was the Swedish archbishop Johannes. The city remained occupied for some time, contributing to its decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century and the rise of Uppsala, Visby, Kalmar and Stockholm. The Livonian Chronicle describes the Oeselians as using two kinds of ships, the piratica and the liburna. The former was a warship, the latter mainly a merchant ship. A piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead and a rectangular sail. Viking-age treasures from Estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars. Saaremaa has the richest finds of Viking treasures after Gotland in Sweden. This strongly suggests that Estonia was an important transit country during the Viking era.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Oeselian pirates carry out a famous raid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1187</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Oeselian pirates atack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Swedish town of Sigtuna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What important figure was killed in the raid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Swedish archbishop Johannes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two ships were used by the Oeselian pirates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the piratica and the liburna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of ship was the liburna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">merchant ship</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The superior god of Oeselians as described by Henry of Latvia was called Tharapita.

People not actually residing there were restricted from travelling to them without a permit. A notable closed military installation was the city of Paldiski, which was entirely closed to all public access. The city had a support base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet's submarines and several large military bases, including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full-scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors. The Paldiski reactors building passed into Estonian control in 1994 after the last Russian troops left the country. Immigration was another effect of Soviet occupation.

As the 1980s progressed, a movement for Estonian autonomy started.

Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former COMECON area.[citation needed] In 1994, based on the economic theories of Milton Friedman, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a flat tax, with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income. In January 2005, the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24%. Another reduction to 23% followed in January 2006. The income tax rate was decreased to 21% by January 2008. The Government of Estonia finalised the design of Estonian euro coins in late 2004, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2011, later than planned due to continued high inflation. A Land Value Tax is levied which is used to fund local municipalities. It is a state level tax, however 100% of the revenue is used to fund Local Councils. The rate is set by the Local Council within the limits of 0.1–2.5%. It is one of the most important sources of funding for municipalities. The Land Value Tax is levied on the value of the land only with improvements and buildings not considered. Very few exemptions are considered on the land value tax and even public institutions are subject to the tax. The tax has contributed to a high rate (~90%) of owner-occupied residences within Estonia, compared to a rate of 67.4% in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Estonia view itself as after winning independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the gateway between East and West</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Estonia establish a flat tax?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1994</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the source of influence for the flat tax?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Milton Friedman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was tax rate imposed on the personal income?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a uniform rate of 26%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1999, Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained independence in 1991, largely because of the impact of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.[citation needed] Estonia joined the WTO in November 1999.
