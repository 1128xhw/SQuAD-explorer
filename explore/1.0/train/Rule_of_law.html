It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. The rule of law was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. The concept, if not the phrase, was familiar to ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, who wrote &quot;Law should govern&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Scottish theologian is first credited with using the phrase &quot;rule of law&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Samuel Rutherford</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which British jurist later made the phrase &quot;rule of law&quot; popular in the 1800s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A.

For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: “no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.” That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed “you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers.” By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more-or-less tracked &quot;the ordinary legal manner&quot; of the courts, further review of the facts by &quot;the ordinary Courts of the land&quot; was unnecessary. That is, if you had your &quot;day in commission,&quot; the rule of law did not require a further &quot;day in court.&quot; Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was a compromise reached over administrative procedures for law determination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who can determine if a law should be approached differently?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">administrators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who should be able to challenge administrative orders in court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individuals </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Charles Evans Hughes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Chief Justice of the United States</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>James Wilson said during the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 that, &quot;Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect.&quot; George Mason agreed that judges &quot;could declare an unconstitutional law void.
