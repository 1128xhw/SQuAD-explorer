It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the de facto Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by Kazakhstan and Russia across the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 78.4 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country that has both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. Iran has long been of geostrategic importance because of its central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country borders Iran to Iran's northwest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Armenia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people live in Iran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">78.4 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Iran's land mass in square miles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">636,372 sq mi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the unofficial name for Iran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Iran's official country name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Islamic Republic of Iran</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200–2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified the area into the first of many empires in 625 BC, after which it became the dominant cultural and political power in the region. Iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC, which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient world, stretching from parts of the Balkans (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia) and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the largest empire the world had yet seen. The empire collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the Great. The Parthian Empire emerged from the ashes and was succeeded by the Sassanid Dynasty in 224 AD, under which Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world, along with the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than four centuries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What civilizations formed in Iran during 3200-2800 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Iranian Medes first unify an empire in the area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">625 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who found the Archaemenid Empire in 550 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Cyrus the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Archaemenid Empire collapse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">330 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ended the Archaemenid Empire by conquest in 330 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexander the Great</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs invaded Iran and conquered it by 651 AD, largely converting Iranian people from their indigenous faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Arabic replaced Persian as the official language, while Persian remained the language of both ordinary people and of literature. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus which made part of the concept of Iran for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia. Popular unrest culminated in the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906, which established a constitutional monarchy and the country's first Majles (parliament). Following a coup d'état instigated by the U.K. and the U.S. in 1953, Iran gradually became close allies with the United States and the rest of the West, remained secular, but grew increasingly autocratic. Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression culminated in the 1979 Revolution, which led to the establishment of an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Rashidun Arabs invade Iran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">633 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Rashidun Arabs conquer Iran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">651 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did the Rashidun Arabs convert the indigenous conquered peoples to? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sunni Islam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country took over Iran's territories in the Caucasus in the 19th Century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Imperial Russia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What movement led to Iran becoming an Islamic republic in 1979?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1979 Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading cultural and economic center.

Furthermore, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, was built in the empire between 353 and 350 BC.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Achaemenid Empire was the known enemy of what nation's histories during its existence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Greek city states</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people lived in the Archaemenid Empire in 480BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50 million people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Achaemenid Empire had what percentage of the word's population in 480BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">44% of the world's population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Achaemenid Empire's official language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Imperial Aramaic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Seven Wonder of the Ancient world was built by the Archaemenid Empire in the 4th Century BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 334 BC, Alexander the Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid emperor, Darius III, at the Battle of Issus.

By the late 1970s, many of these people opposed the Shah's regime and began to organize and join the protests against it.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did oil price spikes in Iran lead to inflation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1973</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused inflation to Iran's economy during the oil price spike in 1973?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">economy of Iran was flooded with foreign currency</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Iran's inflation led to what in 1975-1976?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an economic recession</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did millions of youth migrate to the urban areas of Iran in the mid 1970s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">construction jobs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Due to increased unemployment, who mainly opposed the Shah's regime?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">millions of youth who had migrated to the cities </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The immediate nationwide uprisings against the new government began by the 1979 Kurdish rebellion with the Khuzestan uprisings, along with the uprisings in Sistan and Baluchestan Province and other areas.

In July 1982, with Iraq thrown on the defensive, Iran took the decision to invade Iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer Iraqi territory and capture cities, such as Basra. The war continued until 1988, when the Iraqi army defeated the Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops back across the border. Subsequently, Khomeini accepted a truce mediated by the UN.

Herbs are frequently used along with fruits such as plums, pomegranates, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. Iranians usually eat plain yogurt with lunch and dinner; it is a staple of the diet in Iran. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavourings such as saffron, dried limes, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onions and garlic are normally used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form.
