Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as The Unicode Standard, the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 120,000 characters covering 129 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). As of June 2015[update], the most recent version is Unicode 8.0.

In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code values. UTF-32 is widely used as an internal representation of text in programs (as opposed to stored or transmitted text), since every Unix operating system that uses the gcc compilers to generate software uses it as the standard &quot;wide character&quot; encoding. Some programming languages, such as Seed7, use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters.

These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters.

Even if Unicode had adopted encoding according to spoken order, it would still be problematic to collate words in dictionary order. E.g., the word แสดง  [sa dɛːŋ] &quot;perform&quot; starts with a consonant cluster &quot;สด&quot; (with an inherent vowel for the consonant &quot;ส&quot;), the vowel แ-, in spoken order would come after the ด, but in a dictionary, the word is collated as it is written, with the vowel following the ส.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What standard did Unicode inherit involving a Thai language? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Thai Industrial Standard 620</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why has Thai alphabet support been criticized? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its ordering of Thai characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are the Thai characters ordered incorrectly? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thai characters.

For example, ḗ (precomposed e with macron and acute above) and ḗ (e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above) should be rendered identically, both appearing as an e with a macron and acute accent, but in practice, their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters. Similarly, underdots, as needed in the romanization of Indic, will often be placed incorrectly[citation needed]. Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases, thus avoiding the problem, but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as Charis SIL that uses Graphite, OpenType, or AAT technologies for advanced rendering features.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are characters with diacritical marks represented? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non-spacing marks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What encoding does Charis SIL use? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Graphite, OpenType, or AAT technologies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the issue with underdots and their placement? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">often be placed incorrectly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Characters with what marks can be displayed as a single character or a decomposed sequence? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> diacritical marks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How should the characters with the macron and acute be displayed? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> identically</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
