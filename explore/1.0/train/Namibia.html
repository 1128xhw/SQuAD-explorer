It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates it from that country. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Afrikaans name for Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Namibië</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in Africa is Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">southern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Namibia gain independence from South Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21 March 1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ocean borders Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atlantic Ocean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far away is Namibia to the Zambezi River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200 metres</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Namaqua, and since about the 14th century AD by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion.

Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. The missionaries accompanying the Orlams were well received by them, the right to use waterholes and grazing was granted against an annual payment. On their way further northwards, however, the Orlams encountered clans of the Herero tribe at Windhoek, Gobabis, and Okahandja which were less accommodating. The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only when Imperial Germany deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo between Nama, Orlams, and Herero.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Orlam clans crossed which river to migrate to Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Orange River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area of Namibia did Orlam clans settle in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">southern Namibia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Orlam clans settle in Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Nama-Herero war begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1880</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who deployed troops to start the Nama-Herero war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Imperial Germany</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators Diogo Cão in 1485 and Bartolomeu Dias in 1486; still the region was not claimed by the Portuguese crown.

The South African government also appointed the SWA administrator, who had extensive powers. Following the League's replacement by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement, requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration (along with a definite independence schedule). The Herero Chief's Council submitted a number of petitions to the UN calling for it to grant Namibia independence during the 1950s. During the 1960s, when European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia. In 1966 the International Court of Justice dismissed a complaint brought by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa's continued presence in the territory, but the U.N. General Assembly subsequently revoked South Africa's mandate, while in 1971 the International Court of Justice issued an &quot;advisory opinion&quot; declaring South Africa's continued administration to be illegal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did South Africa refuse to surrender Namibia? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1946</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did South Africa occupy Namibia? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1915</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which council submitted petitions for Namibia's independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Herero Chief's Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the League replaced by the United Nations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1946</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did European powers grant independence to their colonies in Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In response to the 1966 ruling by the International Court of Justice, South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) military wing, People's Liberation Army of Namibia, a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its occupation of Namibia, in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region.

The only perennial rivers are found on the national borders with South Africa, Angola, Zambia, and the short border with Botswana in the Caprivi. In the interior of the country surface water is available only in the summer months when rivers are in flood after exceptional rainfalls. Otherwise, surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff. Thus, where people don’t live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams, they are dependent on groundwater. The advantage of using groundwater sources is that even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources such as mining, agriculture, and tourism can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80% of the country.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Namibia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average rainfall in Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">350 mm per annum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the highest rainfall occur in Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Caprivi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the country does dam water supply the rest of the country with? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Namibia is one of few countries in the world to specifically address conservation and protection of natural resources in its constitution.

The use of open areas close to residential land to urinate and defecate is very common and has been identified as a major health hazard.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most residential areas are insufficient in what area of Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sanitation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides installation cost, why are private flush toilets too expensive for most residents in Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">water consumption</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Namibian's use as a toilet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flying toilets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do flying toilets end up after use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bush</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Urinating and defecating in public has been identified as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">major health hazard</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Whites (mainly of Afrikaner, German, British and Portuguese origin) make up between 4.0 and 7.0% of the population. Although their percentage of population is decreasing due to emigration and lower birth rates they still form the second-largest population of European ancestry, both in terms of percentage and actual numbers, in Sub-Saharan Africa (after South Africa). The majority of Namibian whites and nearly all those who are mixed race speak Afrikaans and share similar origins, culture, and religion as the white and coloured populations of South Africa. A large minority of whites (around 30,000) trace their family origins back to the German settlers who colonized Namibia prior to the British confiscation of German lands after World War One, and they maintain German cultural and educational institutions. Nearly all Portuguese settlers came to the country from the former Portuguese colony of Angola. The 1960 census reported 526,004 persons in what was then South-West Africa, including 73,464 whites (14%).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whites make up how much of Namibia's population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4.0 and 7.0%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the language of Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Afrikaans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do a large minority of whites trace their Namibian roots to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German settlers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population in South-West Africa in 1960?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">526,004 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the population was white in South-West Africa in 1960?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">73,464</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Namibia conducts a census every ten years.

Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as &quot;a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation.&quot; Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and &quot;English language&quot; is a compulsory subject. As in other postcolonial African societies, the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school drop-outs and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">German, English, and Afrikaans were the official languages until when in Namibia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the primary language of Namibia, as SWAPO instituted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">SWAPO thought Namibia should have what type of official language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monolingual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Namibian's speak English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">There was a high rate of what due to monolingual instruction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">school drop-outs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Inline hockey was first played in 1995 and has also become more and more popular in the last years.
