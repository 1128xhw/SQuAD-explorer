The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an arithmetical structure comprising of a set of elements including an operation that joins any two elements to form a third element?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name used to describe the four conditions of closure, associativity, identity and invertibility?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">group axioms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What permits elements with different mathematical starting points to be taken care of in a flexible manner while holding their key basic aspects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abstract formalization of the group axioms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry.

After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.a[›] To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely (its group representations), both from a theoretical and a computational point of view. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups announced in 1983.aa[›] Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the idea of a group come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the study of polynomial equations,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the group notion summed up and solidly settled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are smaller and easier to understand groups broken down into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was announcement for the classification of finite simple groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1983</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The set G is called the underlying set of the group (G, •).

Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry.

Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function. These symmetries determine a group called the dihedral group of degree 4 and denoted D4. The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is function composition. Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application.

The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley's On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θn = 1 (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Which French mathematician expanded on earlier work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Évariste Galois</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The journey for answers to polynomial equations of degree higher than 4 was the original motivation for what theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">group theory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Who developed a theory giving the first abstract definition of a finite group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arthur Cayley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What modern concept was created from many fields of mathematics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abstract group</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with Camille Jordan's Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques (1870).

As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and William Burnside, who worked on representation theory of finite groups, Richard Brauer's modular representation theory and Issai Schur's papers. The theory of Lie groups, and more generally locally compact groups was studied by Hermann Weyl, Élie Cartan and many others.

This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense.

Groups of order p2 can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order p3, as the non-abelian group D4 of order 8 = 23 above shows.

They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e. including translations, is known as the Poincaré group.

There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as (Q ∖ {0}, ·) is derived from (Z ∖ {0}, ·), known as the Grothendieck group. Groupoids are similar to groups except that the composition a • b need not be defined for all a and b. They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in topological and analytical structures, such as the fundamental groupoid or stacks. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary n-ary one (i.e. an operation taking n arguments).
