Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, in order to maintain their assets under management. This choice was supported by a &quot;plausible deniability&quot; of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early &quot;vintages&quot; of subprime loans was so low.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did many asset managers decide to do to the detriment of their clients?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">continue to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a conflict of interest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is compensated based on the volume of client assets they have under management?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Professional investment managers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to maximize their compensation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rationale did asset managers who continued to invest in over-priced investments to the detriment of their clients use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plausible deniability</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern California–based IndyMac, a spin-off of Countrywide Financial.

The financial institution crisis hit its peak in September and October 2008. Several major institutions either failed, were acquired under duress, or were subject to government takeover. These included Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Citigroup, and AIG. On Oct. 6, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lehman's former CEO found himself before Representative Henry A.

The U.S. government responded by extending insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee and with Federal Reserve programs to purchase commercial paper.

Housing prices had dropped 20% from their 2006 peak, with futures markets signaling a 30–35% potential drop.

Total retirement assets, Americans' second-largest household asset, dropped by 22%, from $10.3 trillion in 2006 to $8 trillion in mid-2008. During the same period, savings and investment assets (apart from retirement savings) lost $1.2 trillion and pension assets lost $1.3 trillion.

Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This matters for credit decisions. A homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record. On the other hand, a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk. In the case of businesses, their creditworthiness depends on their future profits. Profit prospects look much worse in November 2008 than they did in November 2007... While many banks are obviously at the brink, consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid.

The continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative. The financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking shakeout since the savings-and-loan meltdown. Investment bank UBS stated on October 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession, with recovery unlikely for at least two years. Three days later UBS economists announced that the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; of the crisis had begun, with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis: capital injection by governments; injection made systemically; interest rate cuts to help borrowers. The United Kingdom had started systemic injection, and the world's central banks were now cutting interest rates. UBS emphasized the United States needed to implement systemic injection. UBS further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis, but that in economic terms &quot;the worst is still to come&quot;. UBS quantified their expected recession durations on October 16: the Eurozone's would last two quarters, the United States' would last three quarters, and the United Kingdom's would last four quarters. The economic crisis in Iceland involved all three of the country's major banks. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland’s banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2008, what type collapse was feared?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">global economic collapse </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What investment bank stated on October 6 that 2008 would see a global recession lasting for at least two years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UBS</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On October 16, 2008, how long did UBS predict the United States' recession would last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three quarters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Relative to the size of its economy, what country's banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iceland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the actions taken by government to fix the financial crisis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capital injection</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Brookings Institution reported in June 2009 that U.S. consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007. &quot;The US economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the U.S. consumer as a source of global demand.&quot; With a recession in the U.S. and the increased savings rate of U.S. consumers, declines in growth elsewhere have been dramatic.

According to the research by the Overseas Development Institute, reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and remittances sent from migrant workers (which reached a record $251 billion in 2007, but have fallen in many countries since). This has stark implications and has led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line, be it 300,000 in Bangladesh or 230,000 in Ghana.

This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest impact of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks.

Major banks suffered losses from AAA-rated created by financial engineering (which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral) that required less capital according to Basel II. Lending to AA-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero, thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis.

Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic.

It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse. In 2005 a group of computer scientists built a computational model for the mechanism of biased ratings produced by rating agencies, which turned out to be adequate to what actually happened in 2006–2008.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which products created more complexity in the financial markets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">innovative financial products</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What effect did the introduction of innovative financial products have on a single mortgage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">multiplied the number of actors connected</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did institutions rely more on as increasing distance from underlying assets occurred?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indirect information</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a type of indirect information that financial institutions and investors used to judge the risk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">computer models of rating agencies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did a group of computer scientists build a model for ratings produced by rating agencies that turned out to be accurate for what happened in 2006-2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk, which may be measured by interest rates or fees.

The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008. Experts debate the causes, with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, some to monetary policy, and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states. A pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified.

But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise, financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the current Governor of the Reserve Bank of India that predicted the crisis in 2005?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Raghuram Rajan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Raghuram Rajan become chief economist the the International Monetary Fund?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2005, where did Rajan deliver a controversial paper that was critical of the financial paper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at a celebration honouring Alan Greenspan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Raghuram Rajan's controversial paper delivered in 2005?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are risks called that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but generous compensation the rest of the time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tail risks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except Raghuram Rajan, who instead spoke of the Great Moderation.

For example, an article in the New York Times informs that economist Nouriel Roubini warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions.

This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history. Following a model initiated by the United Kingdom bank rescue package, the governments of European nations and the USA guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks. In October 2010, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the U.S. Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy —creating currency— as a method to combat the liquidity trap. By creating $600 billion and inserting[clarification needed] this directly into banks, the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages. However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets.

The active phase of the crisis, which manifested as a liquidity crisis, can be dated from August 9, 2007, when BNP Paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing &quot;a complete evaporation of liquidity&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What action in 2007 by national governments prevented the collapse of large financial institutions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bailout of banks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much estimated consumer wealth was lost as a result of the financial crisis of 2007?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trillions of U.S. dollars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the date the active phase of the financial crisis began as a liquidity crisis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 9, 2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the global recession that followed the financial crisis of 2007 end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2012 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the company that terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds in 2007 citing a liquidity crisis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">BNP Paribas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The bursting of the U.S. (United States) housing bubble, which peaked in 2004, caused the values of securities tied to U.S. real estate pricing to plummet, damaging financial institutions globally. The financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of policies that encouraged home ownership, providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers, overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate, questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers, compensation structures that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation, and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making. Questions regarding bank solvency, declines in credit availability and damaged investor confidence had an impact on global stock markets, where securities suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009. Economies worldwide slowed during this period, as credit tightened and international trade declined. Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus, monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts. In the U.S., Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the U.S. housing bubble peak?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Congress pass the American Recover and Reinvestment Act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages was based on the theory that housing prices would continue to do this?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">escalate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">One of the causes of the financial crisis was easier access to loans by this type borrower?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subprime</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2007, banks and insurance companies did not have adequate holdings of which type to back their financial commitments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capital</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested, with varying weight assigned by experts.

The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States. Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets.

Thus, policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds, also known as the shadow banking system.
