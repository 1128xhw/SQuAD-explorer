There are cables with Type-A connectors on both ends, but they should be used carefully. Therefore, in general, each of the different &quot;sizes&quot; requires four different connectors; USB cables have the Type-A and Type-B plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computer or electronic device.

The 12 Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5 Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, which led to the broader PC market using USB as a standard.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the original USB 1.0 Specification introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How fast was the slowest data transfer rate of the USB 1.0?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.5 Mbit/s &quot;Low Speed&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the fastest data transfer rate of the USB 1.0?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12 Mbit/s &quot;Full Speed&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">1.1 was the first widely used version of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">USB</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first widely used version of USB released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 1998</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The new SuperSpeed bus provides a fourth transfer mode with a data signaling rate of 5.0 Gbit/s, in addition to the modes supported by earlier versions.
