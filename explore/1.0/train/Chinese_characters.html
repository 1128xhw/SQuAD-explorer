In Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi (simplified Chinese: 汉字; traditional Chinese: 漢字). They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as kanji, Korean, where they are known as hanja, and Vietnamese in a system known as chữ Nôm. Collectively, they are known as CJKV characters. In English, they are sometimes called Han characters. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the Sinosphere, Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are logograms used in the writing of Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Chinese characters called in standard Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hanzi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have been adapted to write in a number of other languages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese characters</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Studies in China have shown that functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the Jōyō kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use. There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. Simplified forms of certain characters are used in China, Singapore, and Malaysia; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and to a limited extent in South Korea. In Japan, common characters are written in post-WWII Japan-specific simplified forms (shinjitai), which are closer to traditional forms than Chinese simplifications, while uncommon characters are written in Japanese traditional forms (kyūjitai), which are virtually identical to Chinese traditional forms. In South Korea, when Chinese characters are used they are of the traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Teaching of Chinese characters in South Korea starts in the 7th grade and continues until the 12th grade where 1,800 total characters are taught albeit these characters are only used in certain cases (on signs, academic papers, historical writings, etc.) and are slowly declining in use.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What number in the tens of thousands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What requires a knowledge of three to four thousand characters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literacy in written Chinese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which are identical to Chinese forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kyūjitai</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most modern Chinese dictionaries and Chinese dictionaries sold to English speakers use the traditional radical-based character index in a section at the front, while the main body of the dictionary arranges the main character entries alphabetically according to their pinyin spelling.

In modern Chinese (esp. Mandarin Chinese), characters do not necessarily correspond to words; indeed the majority of Chinese words today consist of two or more characters due to the merging and loss of sounds in the Chinese language over time. Rather, a character almost always corresponds to a single syllable that is also a morpheme. However, there are a few exceptions to this general correspondence, including bisyllabic morphemes (written with two characters), bimorphemic syllables (written with two characters) and cases where a single character represents a polysyllabic word or phrase.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are most words in Old Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monosyllabic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What almost always corresponds to a single syllable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">character</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is written with two characters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bisyllabic morphemes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern Chinese has many homophones; thus the same spoken syllable may be represented by many characters, depending on meaning. A single character may also have a range of meanings, or sometimes quite distinct meanings; occasionally these correspond to different pronunciations. Cognates in the several varieties of Chinese are generally written with the same character. They typically have similar meanings, but often quite different pronunciations. In other languages, most significantly today in Japanese and sometimes in Korean, characters are used to represent Chinese loanwords, to represent native words independent of the Chinese pronunciation, and as purely phonetic elements based on their pronunciation in the historical variety of Chinese from which they were acquired. These foreign adaptations of Chinese pronunciation are known as Sino-Xenic pronunciations, and have been useful in the reconstruction of Middle Chinese.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has many homophones?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Modern Chinese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What may have a wide range of meanings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">single character</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have been beneficial in the reconstruction of Middle Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sino-Xenic pronunciations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chinese characters represent words of the language using several strategies.

These characters are composed of two parts: one of a limited set of characters (the semantic indicator, often graphically simplified) which suggests the general meaning of the compound character, and another character (the phonetic indicator) whose pronunciation suggests the pronunciation of the compound character.

All these characters have on the left a radical of three short strokes (氵), which is a reduced form of the character 水 shuǐ meaning &quot;water&quot;, indicating that the character has a semantic connection with water. The right-hand side in each case is a phonetic indicator. For example, in the case of 沖 chōng (Old Chinese *ɡ-ljuŋ), the phonetic indicator is 中 zhōng (Old Chinese *k-ljuŋ), which by itself means &quot;middle&quot;.

Meanwhile, other scripts had evolved, especially in the eastern and southern areas during the late Zhou dynasty, including regional forms, such as the gǔwén (&quot;ancient forms&quot;) of the eastern Warring States preserved as variant forms in the Han dynasty character dictionary Shuowen Jiezi, as well as decorative forms such as bird and insect scripts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has evolved over time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scripts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of forms are bird and insect scripts considered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decorative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is guwen considered as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ancient forms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Seal script, which had evolved slowly in the state of Qin during the Eastern Zhou dynasty, became standardized and adopted as the formal script for all of China in the Qin dynasty (leading to a popular misconception that it was invented at that time), and was still widely used for decorative engraving and seals (name chops, or signets) in the Han dynasty period. However, despite the Qin script standardization, more than one script remained in use at the time. For example, a little-known, rectilinear and roughly executed kind of common (vulgar) writing had for centuries coexisted with the more formal seal script in the Qin state, and the popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread. By the Warring States period, an immature form of clerical script called &quot;early clerical&quot; or &quot;proto-clerical&quot; had already developed in the state of Qin based upon this vulgar writing, and with influence from seal script as well. The coexistence of the three scripts – small seal, vulgar and proto-clerical, with the latter evolving gradually in the Qin to early Han dynasties into clerical script – runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin dynasty had one script only, and that clerical script was suddenly invented in the early Han dynasty from the small seal script.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has evolved slowly in the State of of Qin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Seal script</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What script runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin dynasty had one script only?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">clerical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was invented in the early Han dynasty from the small seal script?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">clerical script</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Contrary to the popular belief of there being only one script per period, there were in fact multiple scripts in use during the Han period.

By around the time of the Eastern Jin dynasty, this Han cursive became known as 章草 zhāngcǎo (also known as 隶草 / 隸草 lìcǎo today), or in English sometimes clerical cursive, ancient cursive, or draft cursive.

The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao's works, including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi. This new script, which is the dominant modern Chinese script, developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with addition of the pause (頓/顿 dùn) technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal. Thus, early regular script emerged from a neat, formal form of semi-cursive, which had itself emerged from neo-clerical (a simplified, convenient form of clerical script). It then matured further in the Eastern Jin dynasty in the hands of the &quot;Sage of Calligraphy&quot;, Wang Xizhi, and his son Wang Xianzhi. It was not, however, in widespread use at that time, and most writers continued using neo-clerical, or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it, for daily writing, while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae, alongside some semi-cursive, but primarily neo-clerical.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had been linked to Zhong Yao?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Regular script</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Zhong Yao known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">father of regular script</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the son of Wang Zishi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wang Xianzhi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It was not until the Northern and Southern dynasties that regular script rose to dominant status.

After this point, although developments in the art of calligraphy and in character simplification still lay ahead, there were no more major stages of evolution for the mainstream script.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the North and South considered as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dynasties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What continued to evolve stylistically?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">regular script</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What script saw no more stages of evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mainstream</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For instance, to look up the character where the sound is not known, e.g., 松 (pine tree), the user first determines which part of the character is the radical (here 木), then counts the number of strokes in the radical (four), and turns to the radical index (usually located on the inside front or back cover of the dictionary).

This practice began long before the standardization of Chinese script by Qin Shi Huang and continues to the present day. The traditional 3rd-person pronoun tā (他 &quot;he, she, it&quot;), which is written with the &quot;person radical&quot;, illustrates modifying significs to form new characters. In modern usage, there is a graphic distinction between tā (她 &quot;she&quot;) with the &quot;woman radical&quot;, tā (牠 &quot;it&quot;) with the &quot;animal radical&quot;, tā (它 &quot;it&quot;) with the &quot;roof radical&quot;, and tā (祂 &quot;He&quot;) with the &quot;deity radical&quot;, One consequence of modifying radicals is the fossilization of rare and obscure variant logographs, some of which are not even used in Classical Chinese. For instance, he 和 &quot;harmony, peace&quot;, which combines the &quot;grain radical&quot; with the &quot;mouth radical&quot;, has infrequent variants 咊 with the radicals reversed and 龢 with the &quot;flute radical&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is written in modern usage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one consequence of modifying radicals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fossilization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What combines &quot;grain radical&quot; with the &quot;mouth radical&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;harmony, peace&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Even the Zhonghua Zihai does not include characters in the Chinese family of scripts created to represent non-Chinese languages.

One of the earliest proponents of character simplification was Lufei Kui, who proposed in 1909 that simplified characters should be used in education. In the years following the May Fourth Movement in 1919, many anti-imperialist Chinese intellectuals sought ways to modernise China. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, and many Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. In many world languages, literacy has been promoted as a justification for spelling reforms. The People's Republic of China issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents, the first in 1956 and the second in 1964. In the 1950s and 1960s, while confusion about simplified characters was still rampant, transitional characters that mixed simplified parts with yet-to-be simplified parts of characters together appeared briefly, then disappeared.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been promoted as a justification for spelling reforms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literacy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Character simplification predated the republic's formation in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who issued the first round of official characters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The People's Republic of China</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
