Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably.

The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens. When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng's peasant rebels in 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Mancus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper. Schoppa, the editor of The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History argues, &quot;A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'.

The daimyo, or lords, were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, daimyo and samurai were more or less identical, since daimyo might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants, ranging from simple local disturbances to much bigger rebellions. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was society based on during the Tukugawa period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strict class hierarchy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Strict class hierarchy was established by who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group were considered to be at the top of the Strict Class Hierarchy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The daimyo, or lords</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were taxes charged during the Tukugawa period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">set at fixed amounts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What effect did  having taxes charged at a fixed amount have on it's revenue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Tokugawa period also known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edo society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was society in  the Tokugawa period based in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strict class hierarchy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group was considered at the top of the Strict Class Society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The daimyo, or lords,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What effect did the way the taxes were charged have on it's revenue.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were taxes charged in the Tokugawa period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">set at fixed amounts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century. The &quot;classic period&quot; ended with the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising Hindu Maratha Empire, although the dynasty continued for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruled most of India in the early 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mughal Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the &quot;Classic Period&quot; end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was behind the death off Emperor Aurangzeb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hindu Maratha Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the The Maratha Empire centralized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">south west of present-day India </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened when the  Maratha Army lost the third battle of Panipat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruled most of India in the 18 century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mughal Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event ended the &quot;classic period&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the death of Emperor Auranzeb? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the rising Hindu Maratha Empire, </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Maratha Empire centralized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">south west of present-day India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the Maratha Empire to split in 1761?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The development of New Imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers.

Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, Aleksey I. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). Finally, Ukraine was split along the river Dnieper, leaving the western part (or Right-bank Ukraine) under Polish rule and eastern part (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian river routes, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the Bering Strait between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Russia experience territorial growth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 17th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The 17th century is also known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">age of Cossacks.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who joined the Cossacks in 1648?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peasants of Ukraine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are Cossacks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">warriors organized into military communities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why dd the Peasants of Ukraine join the Cossacks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Traditionally, the European intellectual transformation of and after the Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era.

As part of the settlement, almost all of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it would retain until the end of World War I.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What countries were involved in the Franco-Russian war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France and Prussia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Prussian and German victory mark?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">final unification of Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name one of the groups who backed Prussia in the Franco-Russian war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North German Confederatio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prussia claimed almost all of what territory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alsace-Lorraine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prussia retained most of Alsace-Lorraine up until what event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War I.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The major European powers laid claim to the areas of Africa where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area.

The European nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony’s commercial interests without having to fear rival European competition. With the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the European power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples, however, this principle remained more theory than practice.

Great Britain controlled various colonial holdings in East Africa that spanned the length of the African continent from Egypt in the north to South Africa. The French gained major ground in West Africa, and the Portuguese held colonies in southern Africa. Germany, Italy, and Spain established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent, which included German East Africa (Tanganyika) and German Southwest Africa for Germany, Eritrea and Libya for Italy, and the Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in northwestern Africa for Spain. Finally, for King Leopold (ruled from 1865–1909), there was the large “piece of that great African cake” known as the Congo, which, unfortunately for the native Congolese, became his personal fiefdom to do with as he pleased in Central Africa. By 1914, almost the entire continent was under European control. Liberia, which was settled by freed American slaves in the 1820s, and Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in eastern Africa were the last remaining independent African states.

In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department.

The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend, and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear. The North kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers. Its soldiers, especially those in the East under the command of General Robert E.

The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial working class which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich industrialists and financiers called the &quot;robber barons&quot;.

With the creation of a transportation and communication infrastructure, the corporation became the dominant form of business organization and a managerial revolution transformed business operations. In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act—the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal, or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase &quot;restraint of trade&quot; remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and industrial production in the United States exceeded that of any other country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form labor unions despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace, declaring the Standard Oil group to be an &quot;unreasonable&quot; monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1911.

The collection of heuristic prescriptions for quantum mechanics were the first corrections to classical mechanics.

Developed from earlier secular traditions, modern Humanist ethical philosophies affirmed the dignity and worth of all people, based on the ability to determine right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities, particularly rationality, without resorting to the supernatural or alleged divine authority from religious texts. For liberal humanists such as Rousseau and Kant, the universal law of reason guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. These ideas were challenged, for example by the young Karl Marx, who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of human rights), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism was nothing more than a secular version of theism. In his Genealogy of Morals, he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it.

The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers.

The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various agreements with Japan, the United States, and Spain, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict.

The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the Baghdad Railway which was planned to connect the Ottoman Empire cities of Konya and Baghdad with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War. Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The Balkan Wars were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Baghdad Railway Suppose to connect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ottoman Empire cities of Konya and Baghdad with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What fundamental cause started the war in 1914?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tensions over territory in the Balkans.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Austria-Hungary war with over territory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Serbia and Russia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Balkan wars take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South-eastern Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Albania fall out with Thessaly, Macedonia and Epirus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over the division of the spoils</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final Armistice in 1918.

The Bolsheviks made peace with the German Empire and the Central Powers, as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution.

In the wake of the October Revolution, the old Russian Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard was the Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the Cheka, the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army. Opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance. Former Tsarist officers were utilized as &quot;military specialists&quot; (voenspetsy), taking their families hostage in order to ensure loyalty. At the start of the war, three-fourths of the Red Army officer corps was composed of former Tsarist officers. By its end, 83% of all Red Army divisional and corps commanders were ex-Tsarist soldiers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Soviets under the rule of the  Bolshevik first assume power during the Russian Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Petrograd (St. Petersburg) </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the wake of the October resolution, what happened to the Russian Imperial Army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">demobilized</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Bolshevik's main military force?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">volunteer-based Red Guard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Red red Army overcome their foes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were former Tsarist Officers utilized? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as &quot;military specialists&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red Army and the forces of the White Army.

No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Was estimated amount of deaths during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">62 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of the deaths during the war were civilians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">About 60%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What countries suffered the most casualties in the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The former Soviet Union and China</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of it's population did Poland lose in the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16%,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many deaths did the Soviet Union suffer in the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Holocaust (which roughly means &quot;burnt whole&quot;) was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other &quot;unwanted&quot; during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany.

The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the Vostok programme and reached its peak with the Apollo program which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of Apollo 11 was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century.
