In 1905 the value E, the minimal energy increment of a hypothetical oscillator, was theoretically associated by Einstein with a &quot;quantum&quot; or minimal element of the energy of the electromagnetic wave itself. The light quantum behaved in some respects as an electrically neutral particle, as opposed to an electromagnetic wave.

That is a very small amount of energy in terms of everyday experience, but everyday experience is not concerned with individual photons any more than with individual atoms or molecules. An amount of light compatible with everyday experience is the energy of one mole of photons; its energy can be computed by multiplying the photon energy by the Avogadro constant, NA ≈ 7023602200000000000♠6.022×1023 mol−1.

Nevertheless, Wilhelm Wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures, by using the principle of adiabatic invariance. At each different temperature, the curve is moved over by Wien's displacement law (1893). Wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object, which was correct at high frequencies (short wavelength) but not at low frequencies (long wavelength).

To make Planck's law, which correctly predicts blackbody emissions, it was necessary to multiply the classical expression by a complex factor that involves h in both the numerator and the denominator. The influence of h in this complex factor would not disappear if it were set to zero or to any other value. Making an equation out of Planck's law that would reproduce the Rayleigh–Jeans law could not be done by changing the values of h, of the Boltzmann constant, or of any other constant or variable in the equation.

Another particularly thorough investigation was published by Philipp Lenard in 1902. Einstein's 1905 paper discussing the effect in terms of light quanta would earn him the Nobel Prize in 1921, when his predictions had been confirmed by the experimental work of Robert Andrews Millikan. The Nobel committee awarded the prize for his work on the photo-electric effect, rather than relativity, both because of a bias against purely theoretical physics not grounded in discovery or experiment, and dissent amongst its members as to the actual proof that relativity was real.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first observed the photoelectric effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexandre Edmond Becquerel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the photoelectric effect first observed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1839</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who published the first thorough investigation of the photoelectric effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heinrich Hertz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Einstein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Einstein with the 1921 Nobel Prize for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his work on the photo-electric effect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the photoelectric effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the emission of electrons (called &quot;photoelectrons&quot;) from a surface when light is shone on it</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first observed the photoelectric effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexandre Edmond Becquerel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Einstein's paper on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1921</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Einstein's photoelectric effect work was rewards as opposed to his work on what other topic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relativity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prior to Einstein's paper, electromagnetic radiation such as visible light was considered to behave as a wave: hence the use of the terms &quot;frequency&quot; and &quot;wavelength&quot; to characterise different types of radiation.

The light from a theatre spotlight is more intense than the light from a domestic lightbulb; that is to say that the spotlight gives out more energy per unit time and per unit space(and hence consumes more electricity) than the ordinary bulb, even though the colour of the light might be very similar.

The gyromagnetic ratio is related to the shielded proton magnetic moment μ′p, the spin number I (I = 1⁄2 for protons) and the reduced Planck constant.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The gyromagnetic ratio is the constant proportion between the magentic field and what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the frequency ν of nuclear magnetic resonance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the water molecule impact the effect of magnetic fields on protons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The protons are said to be &quot;shielded&quot; from the applied magnetic field by the electrons in the water molecule</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What three factors impact the gyromagnetic ratio?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">related to the shielded proton magnetic moment μ′p, the spin number I (I = 1⁄2 for protons) and the reduced Planck constant.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The gyromagnetic ratio is often difficult to determine due to difficulty accurately determining the value of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the applied magnetic field B</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A further complication is that the measurement of γ′p involves the measurement of an electric current: this is invariably measured in conventional amperes rather than in SI amperes, so a conversion factor is required.

Crystals of silicon are used, as they are available in high quality and purity by the technology developed for the semiconductor industry. The unit cell volume is calculated from the spacing between two crystal planes referred to as d220.

This has already been done for the metre, which is defined in terms of a fixed value of the speed of light. The most urgent unit on the list for redefinition is the kilogram, whose value has been fixed for all science (since 1889) by the mass of a small cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept in a vault just outside Paris. While nobody knows if the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram has changed since 1889 – the value 1 kg of its mass expressed in kilograms is by definition unchanged and therein lies one of the problems – it is known that over such a timescale the many similar Pt–Ir alloy cylinders kept in national laboratories around the world, have changed their relative mass by several tens of parts per million, however carefully they are stored, and the more so the more they have been taken out and used as mass standards. A change of several tens of micrograms in one kilogram is equivalent to the current uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant in SI units.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What measurement is deemed most important to redefine in terms of physical constants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the kilogram</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the shape of the object that establishes the base unit of the kilogram?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cylinder </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What alloy is the base unit of the kilogram made from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">platinum–iridium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the base unit for the kilogram kept?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in a vault just outside Paris</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The legal process to change the definition of the kilogram is already underway, but it had been decided that no final decision would be made before the next meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2011.
