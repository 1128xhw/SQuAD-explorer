The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CDs and audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Audio CDs become available for purchase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1982</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does CD stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Compact Disc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does SVCD stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Super Video Compact Disc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were CD's originally created to store?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sound recordings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does SVCD stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Super Video Compact Disc </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were compact discs realesed for purchase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1982</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original intended format for CDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">data storage </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs.

Prototypes were developed by Philips and Sony independently in the late 1970s. In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the Red Book CD-DA standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984. The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between Philips and Sony, who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company, and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created Compact Disc prototypes in the 1970s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philips and Sony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How lond did the creation of Red Book CD-DA standard take?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a year</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what does the compact disc owe its prosperity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the cooperation between Philips and Sony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many CD players were sold in the United States in their first year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the CD evolve from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">LaserDisc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made it possible for CDs to be played on any companies CD player?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unified design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did CD players become available for purchase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1982</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what does the compact disc owe its prosperity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cooperation between Philips and Sony</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1974, L. Ottens, director of the audio division of Philips, started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of 20Â cm and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record. However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974. In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips's prototype compact disc was set at 11.5Â cm, the diagonal of an audio cassette.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Philips institute a laboratory to create a digital audio disc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1977</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the proposed diameter for the original compact disc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11.5Â cm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Philips propse the idea of a digital audio format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1974</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the director of the Philips audio division in 1974?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">L.

His team developed a digital PCM adaptor audio tape recorder using a Betamax video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made. Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30Â cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100Â Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056Â Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction codeâspecifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard Compact Disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13â16 March 1979, in Brussels. Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called &quot;Philips Introduce Compact Disc&quot; in Eindhoven, Netherlands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the 62nd AES Convention held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brussels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the general manger of Sony's audio department in 1971?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heitaro Nakajima</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Sony first exhibit the use of an optical digital audio disc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1976</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Nakajima's team use to create a digital PCM adaptor audio tape recorder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Betamax video recorder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Philips Introduce Compact disc conference held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eindhoven, Netherlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Nakajima's team use to create a digital PCM adaptor audio tape recorder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Betamax video recorder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Sony release it's AES technical paper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1 March 1979</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a result, in 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc.

This event is often seen as the &quot;Big Bang&quot; of the digital audio revolution. The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable Walkman the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was Dire Straits, with their 1985 album Brothers in Arms. The first major artist to have his entire catalogue converted to CD was David Bowie, whose 15 studio albums were made available by RCA Records in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums. In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first sold a million copies on CD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dire Straits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which artist was the first to have their full catalogue converted to CD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Bowie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Dire Straits album Brothers in Arms released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many studio albums did David Bowie release in February 1985?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many CDs were mass produced in 1988?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many studio albums did David Bowie release in February 1985?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The CD was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (read-only memory) and, in 1990, CD-Recordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips. Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does ROM stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">read-only memory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Sony and Philips release CD-Recordable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original intended format for CDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">musical format</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the 73rd AES Convention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1983</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the CDs predecessor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the gramophone record</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the CDs predecessor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gramophone record</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of Internet-based distribution of files in lossily-compressed audio formats such as MP3, sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s.

On average, the store received 35 percent of the retail price, the record company 27 percent, the artist 16 percent, the manufacturer 13 percent, and the distributor 9 percent. When 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs were introduced, each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded, even though the cost to produce the media was reduced. This was done because the apparent value increased. This continued from vinyl to CDs but was broken when Apple marketed MP3s for $0.99, and albums for $9.99. The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is very small.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the priciest component of a CD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jewel case</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the cost of audio music increase when the production costs decreased?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> value increased</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did CDs retail for in 1995?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$16.98</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who received the most profit from the sale of CDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the store</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did a jewel case cost in 1995?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 cents</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>CD-R recordings are designed to be permanent.

The adoption of EFM one month later would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120Â mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100Â mm. The 120Â mm diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats, including Super Audio CD, DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc.
