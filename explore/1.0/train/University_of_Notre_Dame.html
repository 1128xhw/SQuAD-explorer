Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend &quot;Venite Ad Me Omnes&quot;. Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint Bernadette Soubirous</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is in front of the Notre Dame Main Building?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a copper statue of Christ</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Basilica of the Sacred heart at Notre Dame is beside to which structure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Main Building</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Grotto at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Marian place of prayer and reflection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sits on top of the Main Building at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a golden statue of the Virgin Mary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Scholastic Magazine of Notre dame begin publishing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 1876</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How often is Notre Dame's the Juggler published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the daily student paper at Notre Dame called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Observer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many student news papers are found at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the student paper Common Sense begin publication at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1987</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The university is the major seat of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which are in Rome).

This changed in 1924 with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees. Today each of the five colleges offer graduate education. Most of the departments from the College of Arts and Letters offer PhD programs, while a professional Master of Divinity (M.Div.) program also exists.

The School of Architecture offers a Master of Architecture, while each of the departments of the College of Engineering offer PhD programs. The College of Business offers multiple professional programs including MBA and Master of Science in Accountancy programs.

His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it.

This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Work on a germ-free-life ended up in the creation of which Notre Dame institute?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Lobund Institute</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around what time did Lobund of Notre Dame become independent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1940s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Lobund at Notre Dame become an Institute?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Lobund Institute was merged into the Department of Biology at Notre Dame in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1958</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did study of a germ-free-life begin at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1928</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Review of Politics was founded in 1939 by Gurian, modeled after German Catholic journals.

The university maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military academy program of full-contact intramural American football.

Construction was started on the 17th of May and by the incredible zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire, a music hall was opened.

Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school.

The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Catholic people identified with Notre Dame, what religious group did people feel Yale represented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Protestant establishment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Notre Dame students had a showdown in 1924 with which anti-catholic group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ku Klux Klan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which college president of Notre Dame is credited with preventing more confrontations between students and the KKK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fr.

Enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950, and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the lifespan of Theodore Hesburgh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1917–2015</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the time that Hesburgh was president of Notre Dame by what factor did the operating budget increase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the size of the Notre Dame endowment when Theodore Hesburgh became president?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$9 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what years was Theodor Hesburgh president of Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1952–87</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many faculty members were at Notre Dame when Hesburgh left the role of president?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">950</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hesburgh is also credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales. &quot;In American college education,&quot; explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and Letters, &quot;certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place.... In this environment of diversity, the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism.&quot; Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added that coeducation &quot;opened up a whole other pool of very bright students.&quot; Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school year. In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate; she transferred from St. Mary's College. In 1972 the first woman to graduate was Angela Sienko, who earned a bachelor's degree in marketing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of educational institute is Hesburgh given credit for creating at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coeducational</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which role did Charles Sheedy have at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dean of Arts and Letters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What title did Thomas Blantz have at Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vice President of Student Affairs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Notre Dame have its earliest undergraduate that was female?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what institute did Notre Dame agree to an exchange program in the 1960s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint Mary's College</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005), there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources.

Yves Simon (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused many intellectual Catholics to leave europe in the 1930s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The rise of Hitler and other dictators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where did Anton-Hermann Chroust come to reach Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What field of study did Anton-Hermann Chroust specialize in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classics and law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Waldemar Gurian receive his tutelage under while seeking his doctorate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Max Scheler</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Ivan Meštrović known for being?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a renowned sculptor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame /ˌnoʊtərˈdeɪm/ NOH-tər-DAYM) is a Catholic research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United States.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what conference did the Fighting Irish go after the Big East?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ACC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many teams in each season do the Fighting Irish commit to play against ACC opponents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Fighting Irish hockey team compete prior to a move to Hockey East, in terms of conference?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Central Collegiate Hockey Association</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What colors are the official ones used by Notre Dame in sport competition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Navy Blue and Gold Rush</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of mascot do the Notre Dame sport teams have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leprechaun</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement in which Under Armour will provide uniforms, apparel,equipment, and monetary compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years.

In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history.

Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center), which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2014–15 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame, has achieved a 332-165 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During the 2014-15 season, the team went 32-6 and won the ACC conference tournament, later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion Duke Blue Devils twice during the season. The 32 wins were the most by the Fighting Irish team since 1908-09.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many wins does the Notre Dame men's basketball team have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 1,600</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many schools have a similar men's basketball record to Notre Dame in terms of wins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many NCAA tournaments did the Notre Dame men's basketball team take part in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Notre Dame men's basketball player has the record for more points in one game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austin Carr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Notre Dame men's basketball coach in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mike Brey</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The &quot;Notre Dame Victory March&quot; is the fight song for the University of Notre Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev. Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F. Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, &quot;Cheer cheer for old Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high, shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small, old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward to victory!&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the original lyrics to the Notre Dame Victory March?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John F.
