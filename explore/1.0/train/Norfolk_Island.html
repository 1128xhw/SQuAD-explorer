The convicts detained have long been assumed to be a hardcore of recidivists, or 'doubly-convicted capital respites' – that is, men transported to Australia who committed fresh colonial crimes for which they were sentenced to death, and were spared the gallows on condition of life at Norfolk Island. However, a recent study has demonstrated, utilising a database of 6,458 Norfolk Island convicts, that the reality was somewhat different: more than half were detained at Norfolk Island without ever receiving a colonial conviction, and only 15% had been reprieved from a death sentence. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of convicts sent to Norfolk Island had committed non-violent property sentences, and the average length of detention was three years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who instructed the Governor of New South Wales Thomas Brisbane to send the worst convicts to Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the British government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What previous disadvantage of Norfolk Island was seen as an advantage for holding male convicts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Its remoteness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the prisoners on Norfolk Island spared from on the the mainland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the gallows</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many convicts are listed in the database at Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 6,458</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the average length of a prisoner's detention at Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> three years</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 8 June 1856, the next settlement began on Norfolk Island.

The airstrip was constructed by Australian, New Zealand and United States servicemen during 1942. Since Norfolk Island fell within New Zealand's area of responsibility it was garrisoned by a New Zealand Army unit known as N Force at a large Army camp which had the capacity to house a 1,500 strong force. N Force relieved a company of the Second Australian Imperial Force.

The sooty tern (known locally as the whale bird) has traditionally been subject to seasonal egg harvesting by Norfolk Islanders.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What island in the Norfolk Island Group is home to breeding seabirds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nepean Island</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What near extinct bird of Norfolk Island has shown signs of population increase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The providence petrel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where has the providence petrel been seen breeding on Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phillip Island</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other types of petrels breed on Phillip Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the white-necked petrel, Kermadec petrel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the sooty tern known as on Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the whale bird</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cetaceans were historically abundant around the island as commercial hunts on the island was operating until 1956.

After the death of the first chaplain Rev G. H. Nobbs in 1884, a Methodist church was formed and in 1891 a Seventh-day Adventist congregation led by one of Nobbs' sons. Some unhappiness with G. H. Nobbs, the more organised and formal ritual of the Church of England service arising from the influence of the Melanesian Mission, decline in spirituality, the influence of visiting American whalers, literature sent by Christians overseas impressed by the Pitcairn story, and the adoption of Seventh-day Adventism by the descendants of the mutineers still on Pitcairn, all contributed to these developments. The Roman Catholic Church began work in 1957 and in the late 1990s a group left the former Methodist (then Uniting Church) and formed a charismatic fellowship. In 2011, 34 percent of the ordinary residents identified as Anglican, 13 percent as Uniting Church, 12 percent as Roman Catholic and three percent as Seventh-day Adventist. Nine percent were from other religions. Twenty four percent had no religion, and seven percent did not indicate a religion. Typical ordinary congregations in any church do not exceed 30 local residents as of 2010[update]. The three older denominations have good facilities.

In 2004 an act of the Norfolk Island Assembly made it a co-official language of the island. The act is long-titled: &quot;An Act to recognise the Norfolk Island Language (Norf'k) as an official language of Norfolk Island.&quot; The &quot;language known as 'Norf'k'&quot; is described as the language &quot;that is spoken by descendants of the first free settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island&quot;. The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it; in official use, it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English. 32% of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in the 2011 census, and just under three-quarters of the ordinarily resident population could speak Norfuk.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What languages do residents of Norfolk Island speak?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English and a creole language known as Norfuk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Norfuk language a mixture of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th-century English and Tahitian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Norfuk language of Norfolk Island was first spoken by whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">descendants of the first free settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the official co-language of Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Norfuk language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the residents of Norfolk Island could speak Norfuk as of 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">under three-quarters</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Norfolk Island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have achieved self-governance.

There is a strong belief on the island that some of the revenue generated from Norfolk's EEZ should be available to providing services such as health and infrastructure on the island, which the island has been responsible for, similar to how the Northern Territory is able to access revenue from their mineral resources. The exclusive economic zone provides the islanders with fish, its only major natural resource. Norfolk Island has no direct control over any marine areas but has an agreement with the Commonwealth through the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) to fish &quot;recreationally&quot; in a small section of the EEZ known locally as &quot;the Box&quot;. While there is speculation that the zone may include oil and gas deposits, this is not proven. There are no major arable lands or permanent farmlands, though about 25 per cent of the island is a permanent pasture. There is no irrigated land. The island uses the Australian dollar as its currency.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What services do Norfolk Island residents believe should be made available from the Norfolk Island's EEZ profit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">health and infrastructure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Norfolk Island's only major natural resource?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> fish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the area residents of Norfolk Island are permitted to fish recreationally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Box</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is speculated to be available in Norfolk Island's EEZ zone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> oil and gas deposits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Norfolk Island is a permanent pasture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 25 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Residents of Norfolk Island do not pay Australian federal taxes, creating a tax haven for locals and visitors alike. Because there is no income tax, the island's legislative assembly raises money through an import duty, fuel levy, medicare levy, GST of 12% and local/international phone calls. In a move that apparently surprised many islanders the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, David Buffett, announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts. The introduction of income taxation will now come into effect on July 1, 2016, with a variation of opinion on the island about these changes but with many understanding that for the island's governance to continue there is a need to pay into the commonwealth revenue pool so that the island can have assistance in supporting its delivery of State government responsibilities such as health, education, medicare, and infrastructure. Prior to these reforms residents of Norfolk Island were not entitled to social services. It appears that the reforms do extend to companies and trustees and not only individuals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Norfolk Island inhabitants and visitors don't pay what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australian federal taxes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Buffett</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What reason did David Buffett give for Norfolk Island surrendering its' tax-free status?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">for a financial bailout from the federal government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When will income tax be introduced on Norfolk Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> July 1, 2016</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of services were Norfolk Island inhabitants unable to receive prior to this announcement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As of 2004[update], 2532 telephone main lines are in use, a mix of analog (2500) and digital (32) circuits.

Loading jetties are located at Kingston and Cascade, but ships cannot get close to either of them. When a supply ship arrives, it is emptied by whaleboats towed by launches, five tonnes at a time. Which jetty is used depends on the prevailing weather on the day. The jetty on the leeward side of the island is often used. If the wind changes significantly during unloading/loading, the ship will move around to the other side.
