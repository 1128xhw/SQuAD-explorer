The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former Soviet republics and created the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), although five of the signatories ratified it much later or not at all. On the previous day, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union, resigned, declared his office extinct, and handed over its powers – including control of the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes – to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. That evening at 7:32 p.m., the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary Russian flag.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did the Soviet Union dissolve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> December 26, 1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What entity was created in place of the Soviet Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Commonwealth of Independent States </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was president of the Soviet Union when it came to an end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mikhail Gorbachev,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became president of Russia after Gorbachev left office?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boris Yeltsin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which flag replaced the Soviet flag at the Kremlin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pre-revolutionary Russian flag.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo on March 11, 1985, three hours after predecessor Konstantin Chernenko's death at age 73. Gorbachev, aged 54, was the youngest member of the Politburo. His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the Soviet economy, and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures. The reforms began with personnel changes of senior Brezhnev-era officials who would impede political and economic change. On April 23, 1985, Gorbachev brought two protégés, Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov, into the Politburo as full members. He kept the &quot;power&quot; ministries happy by promoting KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov from candidate to full member and appointing Minister of Defence Marshal Sergei Sokolov as a Politburo candidate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was General Secretary prior to Mikhail Gorbachev?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Konstantin Chernenko</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused Chernenko to leave office?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">death </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Gorbachev when he was elected as the General Secretary? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">54</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What entity was responsible for Gorbachev's being elected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Politburo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To which two people did Gorbachev grant membership into the Politburo for his own reasons? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This liberalization, however, fostered nationalist movements and ethnic disputes within the Soviet Union.

Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made &quot;bathtub vodka&quot; with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Gorbachev's speech addressing alcohol abuse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than increasing pricing what was another measure that was introduced to decrease alcohol consumption?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rationing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was censored?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> drinking scenes from old movies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose anti-alcohol program did Gorbachev's remind people of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Tsar Nicholas II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Tsar Nicholas II ban alcohol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">during World War I,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On July 1, 1985, Gorbachev promoted Eduard Shevardnadze, First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party, to full member of the Politburo, and the following day appointed him minister of foreign affairs, replacing longtime Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.

Demonstrations started in the morning of December 17, 1986, with 200 to 300 students in front of the Central Committee building on Brezhnev Square protesting Konayev's dismissal and replacement by a Russian. Protesters swelled to 1,000 to 5,000 as other students joined the crowd. The CPK Central Committee ordered troops from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, druzhiniki (volunteers), cadets, policemen, and the KGB to cordon the square and videotape the participants. The situation escalated around 5 p.m., as troops were ordered to disperse the protesters.

Reports from Kazakh SSR authorities estimated that the riots drew 3,000 people. Other estimates are of at least 30,000 to 40,000 protestors with 5,000 arrested and jailed, and an unknown number of casualties. Jeltoqsan leaders say over 60,000 Kazakhs participated in the protests. According to the Kazakh SSR government, there were two deaths during the riots, including a volunteer police worker and a student. Both of them had died due to blows to the head. About 100 others were detained and several others were sentenced to terms in labor camps. Sources cited by the Library of Congress claimed that at least 200 people died or were summarily executed soon thereafter; some accounts estimate casualties at more than 1,000.

On August 15, 1987, former political prisoners formed the MRP-AEG group (Estonians for the Public Disclosure of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), which was headed by Tiit Madisson. In September 1987, the Edasi newspaper published a proposal by Edgar Savisaar, Siim Kallas, Tiit Made, and Mikk Titma calling for Estonia's transition to autonomy. Initially geared toward economic independence, then toward a certain amount of political autonomy, the project, Isemajandav Eesti (&quot;A Self-Managing Estonia&quot;) became known according to its Estonian acronym, IME, which means &quot;miracle&quot;. On October 21, a demonstration dedicated to those who gave their lives in the 1918–1920 Estonian War of Independence took place in Võru, which culminated in a conflict with the militia. For the first time in years, the blue, black, and white national tricolor was publicly displayed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was being protested in Estonia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> new phosphate mines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the phosphate mine protests begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spring 1987</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group was started by ex-political prisoners?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MRP-AEG group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was in charge of the MRP-AEG group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tiit Madisson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was requested for Estonia in the proposal printed by the Edasi newspaper in 1987?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">autonomy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On October 17, 1987, about 3,000 Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan complaining about the condition of Lake Sevan, the Nairit chemicals plant, and the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, and air pollution in Yerevan.

This local vote in a small, remote part of the Soviet Union made headlines around the world; it was an unprecedented defiance of republic and national authorities. On February 22, 1988, in what became known as the &quot;Askeran clash&quot;, two Azerbaijanis were killed by Karabakh police. These deaths, announced on state radio, led to the Sumgait Pogrom. Between February 26 and March 1, the city of Sumgait (Azerbaijan) saw violent anti-Armenian rioting during which 32 people were killed.

These events showed that the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union did not support Gorbachev's drive to modernize Communism; rather, they preferred to abandon it altogether.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was elected in 1989?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new Congress of People's Deputies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was questioned on live TV?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Communist leadership</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Communist government overthrown first?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Warsaw </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Berlin Wall get torn down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1989</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Eastern European people want to do with communism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abandon it </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the March 26 general elections, voter participation was an impressive 89.8%, and 1,958 (including 1,225 district seats) of the 2,250 CPD seats were filled.

However, it would have meant some degree of continued Communist Party control over economic and social life.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Gorbachev attempting to decentralize? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet Union </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was supposed to be signed on August 20?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Union Treaty </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supported the treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Central Asian republics,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would have maintained power if the treaty was signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Communist Party </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>More radical reformists were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required, even if the eventual outcome meant the disintegration of the Soviet Union into several independent states.

The special forces dispatched by the coup leaders took up positions near the White House, but members refused to storm the barricaded building.

The legality of this action was questionable, since Soviet law did not allow a republic to unilaterally recall its deputies. However, no one in either Russia or the Kremlin objected. Any objections from the latter would have likely had no effect, since the Soviet government had effectively been rendered impotent long before December. In effect, the largest and most powerful republic had seceded from the Union.

The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier. By December 31, 1991, the few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased operation, and individual republics assumed the central government's role.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What went down after Gorbachev departed from the Kremlin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet flag</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What replaced the Soviet flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russian tricolor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Gorbachev make his final Kremlin exit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 25, 1991, at 7:32 p.m. Moscow time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was declared as having ceased to exist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What body also stopped existing following a vote by itself to end itself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Alma-Ata Protocol also addressed other issues, including UN membership.
