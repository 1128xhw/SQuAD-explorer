These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose &quot;to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies&quot;. To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index. Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index, but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Mahbub ul Haq devise and launch the HDI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was initially opposed to the idea of creating the HDI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amartya Sen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mahbub ul Haq was hoping to shift the focus of development economics to what type of policies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">people-centered policies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which year was used for estimates in the 2011 report?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>LE: Life expectancy at birth

They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country’s development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because - they claim - the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[citation needed] In 2010 the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to The Economist in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded to a January 6, 2011 article in the magazine which discusses the Wolff et al. paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff et al. in that it generates a system for continuous updating of the human development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many economists were cited as pointing out data errors in the HDI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the UNDP respond to the criticism of its report?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which magazine publication carried a statement from the Human Development Report Office in January, 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Economist</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The HDI has extended its geographical coverage: David Hastings, of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, published a report geographically extending the HDI to 230+ economies, whereas the UNDP HDI for 2009 enumerates 182 economies and coverage for the 2010 HDI dropped to 169 countries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many countries were included in the 2009 HDI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">182</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many countries were included in the 2010 HDI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">169</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
