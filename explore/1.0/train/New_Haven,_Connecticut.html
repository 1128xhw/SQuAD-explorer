These settlers were hoping to establish a (in their mind) better theological community, with the government more closely linked to the church than the one they left in Massachusetts and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the harbor.

At the time, the New Haven Colony was separate from the Connecticut Colony, which had been established to the north centering on Hartford.

Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as &quot;The Arsenal of America&quot;. It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836.

The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country. Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of nine square blocks; the central square was left open, in the tradition of many New England towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted the first public tree planting program in America. As in other cities, many of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname &quot;Elm City&quot; perished in the mid-20th century due to Dutch Elm disease, although many have since been replanted. The New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city. The Green remains the social center of the city today.

New Haven-style pizza, called &quot;apizza&quot; (pronounced ah-BEETS, [aˈpitts] in the original Italian dialect), made its debut at the iconic Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (known as Pepe's) in 1925. Apizza is baked in coal- or wood-fired brick ovens, and is notable for its thin crust. Apizza may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of garlic and olive oil), and pies ordered &quot;plain&quot; are made without the otherwise customary mozzarella cheese (originally smoked mozzarella, known as &quot;scamorza&quot; in Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants on Wooster Street in the Little Italy section of New Haven, including Pepe's and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, which opened in 1934, is also well-known.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dish is commonly considered to be penultimate culinary achievement in New Haven?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Haven-style pizza</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the colloquial term afforded to New Haven-style pizza?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;apizza&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what New Haven establishment did &quot;apizza&quot; make it's inaugural appearance in 1925? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ingredient is notably absent from a New Haven-style pizza when ordered plain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mozzarella cheese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what section of New Haven would one expect to find an outstanding white clam pie pizza on Wooster Street?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Little Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">New Haven, in terms of food is best known for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pizza</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did New Haven pizza style originated from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In general what are &quot;apizza&quot; known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its thin crust</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">White clam pie is found in what district of New Haven?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wooster Street in the Little Italy section </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was New Haven-style pizza found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1925</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A second New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Louis' Lunch, which is located in a small brick building on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895.

As nearby Bridgeport built new sports facilities, the brutalist New Haven Coliseum rapidly deteriorated. Believing the upkeep on the venue to be a drain of tax dollars, the DeStefano administration closed the Coliseum in 2002; it was demolished in 2007. New Haven's last professional sports team, the New Haven County Cutters, left in 2009. The DeStefano administration did, however, see the construction of the New Haven Athletic Center in 1998, a 94,000-square-foot (8,700 m2) indoor athletic facility with a seating capacity of over 3,000. The NHAC, built adjacent to Hillhouse High School, is used for New Haven public schools athletics, as well as large-scale area and state sporting events; it is the largest high school indoor sports complex in the state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 1995 mayor of New Haven sought to reinvent the area into a northeastern hub of art and culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John DeStefano, Jr.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sports complex was shuttered in New Haven by the DeStefano administration in 2002? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Haven Coliseum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was New Haven's last professional sports team?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Haven County Cutters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What indoor sporting complex in New Haven was constructed by the DeStefano administration in 1998?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Haven Athletic Center</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the approximate seating capacity of the New Haven Athletic Center?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 3,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the mayor for the city in the late 90s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> John DeStefano, Jr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Due to the heavy upkeep, DeStefano decided to close what major infrastructure in the city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Haven Coliseum </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the last time New Haven had a professional sport team?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In terms of capacity how big was the new constructed New Haven Athletic Center?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> over 3,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>New Haven was the host of the 1995 Special Olympics World Summer Games; then-President Bill Clinton spoke at the opening ceremonies.

In 1779, during the Battle of New Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New Haven be launched. The United States Congress deeded the site to the state in 1921, and all three versions of the fort have been restored.
