Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. The first Lib–Lab candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the Independent Labour Party, the intellectual and largely middle-class Fabian Society, the Marxist Social Democratic Federation and the Scottish Labour Party.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About when did the Labour Parry start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">when was george odger elected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1899, a Doncaster member of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, Thomas R.

The motion was passed at all stages by the TUC, and the proposed conference was held at the Memorial Hall on Farringdon Street on 26 and 27 February 1900. The meeting was attended by a broad spectrum of working-class and left-wing organisations — trades unions represented about one third of the membership of the TUC delegates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Thomas R.

It had no single leader, and in the absence of one, the Independent Labour Party nominee Ramsay MacDonald was elected as Secretary. He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The October 1900 &quot;Khaki election&quot; came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to £33.

The judgement effectively made strikes illegal since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of Arthur Balfour to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the Liberal Party in opposition to the Conservative's landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What boosted support in 1901?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taff Vale Case</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Taft Vale Case?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a dispute between strikers and a railway company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From this case, what happened?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">made strikes illegal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much were they ordered to pay in damages for the strike?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£23,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name &quot;The Labour Party&quot; formally (15 February 1906).

In the party's early years the Independent Labour Party (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The Fabian Society provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party.

The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the Trade Unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest Trades Unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow Trade Unions to fund Labour MPs once more.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many MP were elected in the 1910 election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">42 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who passed the Osborne judgment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Trade Disputes Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Trade Disputes Act passed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1913</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Communist Party of Great Britain was refused affiliation to the Labour Party between 1921 and 1923.

The letter had little impact on the Labour vote—which held up. It was the collapse of the Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals.

This caused great anger among those within the Labour Party who felt betrayed by MacDonald's actions: he and his supporters were promptly expelled from the Labour Party and formed a separate National Labour Organisation. The remaining Labour Party MPs (led again by Arthur Henderson) and a few Liberals went into opposition.

Kinnock campaigned on the theme &quot;It's Time for a Change&quot;, urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a dramatic change in the change of leader from Thatcher to Major, at least in terms of style if not substance. From the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 &quot;Poll of Polls&quot; was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Kinnock call for a general election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Kinnocks party theme?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;It's Time for a Change&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original Tory lead percentage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the percentage fall to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kinnock then resigned as leader and was replaced by John Smith. Smith's leadership once again saw the re-emergence of tension between those on the party's left and those identified as &quot;modernisers&quot;, both of whom advocated radical revisions of the party's stance albeit in different ways. At the 1993 conference, Smith successfully changed the party rules and lessened the influence of the trade unions on the selection of candidates to stand for Parliament by introducing a one member, one vote system called &quot;OMOV&quot; — but only barely, after a barnstorming speech by John Prescott which required Smith to compromise on other individual negotiations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced Kinnock?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> John Smith</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Smith change the party's rules?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1993 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does OMOV stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one member, one vote</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Black Wednesday economic disaster in September 1992 left the Conservative government's reputation for monetary excellence in tatters, and by the end of that year Labour had a comfortable lead over the Tories in the opinion polls.

It was a continuation of the trend that had begun under the leadership of Neil Kinnock. &quot;New Labour&quot; as a name has no official status, but remains in common use to distinguish modernisers from those holding to more traditional positions, normally referred to as &quot;Old Labour&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the other name for the Labout Party?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;New Labour&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was this branding first used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1994</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Labour publish a new draft manifesto?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was this manifesto called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Labour, New Life For Britain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A perceived turning point was when Blair controversially allied himself with US President George W.

In the event, the party did lose power in Scotland to a minority Scottish National Party government at the 2007 elections and, shortly after this, Blair resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Although the party experienced a brief rise in the polls after this, its popularity soon slumped to its lowest level since the days of Michael Foot. During May 2008, Labour suffered heavy defeats in the London mayoral election, local elections and the loss in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election, culminating in the party registering its worst ever opinion poll result since records began in 1943, of 23%, with many citing Brown's leadership as a key factor. Membership of the party also reached a low ebb, falling to 156,205 by the end of 2009: over 40 per cent of the 405,000 peak reached in 1997 and thought to be the lowest total since the party was founded.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Blair announce he was quitting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> September 2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the next elections?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Labour lose power in the election to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scottish National Party</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Blair replaced by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his Chancellor, Gordon Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the party membership at the end of 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">156,205</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
