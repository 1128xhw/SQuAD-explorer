Its founding purpose was to serve the Northwest Territory, an area that today includes the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota. Instruction began in 1855; women were admitted in 1869. Today, the main campus is a 240-acre (97 ha) parcel in Evanston, along the shores of Lake Michigan just 12 miles north of downtown Chicago. The university's law, medical, and professional schools are located on a 25-acre (10 ha) campus in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. In 2008, the university opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar with programs in journalism and communication.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Northwestern University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Evans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Northwestern founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1851</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Northwestern University began teaching?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1855</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year were women allowed to attend Northwestern University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1869</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Northwestern University opened an additional campus at in 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Education City, Doha, Qatar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Northwestern's founding purpose in 1851?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to serve the Northwest Territory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did instruction begin at Northwestern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1855</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were women first admitted to Northwestern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1869</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many acres is the modern-day Northwestern campus in Evanston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">240</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What programs are offered at Northwestern's Quatar campus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">journalism and communication</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which great lake is Northwestern located along?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lake Michigan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the city located 12 miles north of Northwestern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chicago</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University, making it the first chartered university in Illinois. The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting. Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they were committed to non-sectarian admissions, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many founders did Northwestern University have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of church is Northwestern University associated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Methodist Episcopal Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date that lay down the foundation for Northwestern University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 31, 1850</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many ministers founded Northwestern University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What denomination did the all of the founders associated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Methodists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what environment was the foundation for Northwestern University planned on May 31, 1850?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a meeting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University in January of 1851?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Illinois General Assembly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the religious affiliation of all 9 founding members of Northwestern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Methodist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of Northwestern's 9 founders were ministers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which church did the 9 founders of Northwestern affiliate the university with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Methodist Episcopal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John Evans, for whom Evanston is named, bought 379 acres (153 ha) of land along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of Evanston, Illinois. The first building, Old College, opened on November 5, 1855. To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold $100 &quot;perpetual scholarships&quot; entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition. Another building, University Hall, was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as the Chicago Water Tower, also built in 1869, one of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. In 1873 the Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern, and Frances Willard, who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the founders of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), became the school's first dean of women. Willard Residential College (1938) is named in her honor. Northwestern admitted its first women students in 1869, and the first woman was graduated in 1874.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first building opened in 1855?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Northwestern sell to raise funds for it's first building?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$100 &quot;perpetual scholarships&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who received free tuition after buying the $100 perpetual scholarships?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the purchaser and his heirs </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Northwestern merge with in 1873?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Evanston College for Ladies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Northwestern's first dean of women?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frances Willard</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the Big Ten Conference.

The Northwestern University School of Law is the oldest law school in Chicago. As the university increased in wealth and distinction, and enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston; the result was a modern research university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which gave equal weight to teaching and research.

In 1933, a proposal to merge Northwestern with the University of Chicago was considered but rejected. Northwestern was also one of the first six universities in the country to establish a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) in the 1920s. Northwestern played host to the first-ever NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game in 1939 in the original Patten Gymnasium, which was later demolished and relocated farther north along with the Dearborn Observatory to make room for the Technological Institute.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of campus did Northwestern begin construction of during Walter Dill Scott's presidency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">integrated</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the orginal name for Northwestern's Ryan Field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dyche Stadium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What merger was proposed and rejected in 1933?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Northwestern with the University of Chicago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Northwestern one of the first six universities in the U.S. to establish in the 1920's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What first-ever game did Northwestern host in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II. Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, when nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses. After the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University. Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism, disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972. Northwestern's exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town and gown tension.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which war transformed many colleges, including Northwestern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between 1939 and 1949, how many military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nearly 50,000 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under what Bill did enrollments surge after the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">G.I.

In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Walter Dill Scott's capital campaign, 8.5 acres (3.44 ha) of land were purchased at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920. The architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus which he designed in collegiate gothic style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building which would house the medical and dental schools and to create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance. The building would become the first university skyscraper in the United States. In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law. The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927.

Northwestern's schools of management, engineering, and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation. Northwestern received $550 million in research funding in 2014. Northwestern supports nearly 1,500 research laboratories across two campuses, predominately in the medical and biological sciences. Through the Innovation and New Ventures Office (INVO), Northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions, filed 270 patents applications, received 81 foreign and US patents, started 12 companies, and generated $79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013. The bulk of revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin, a synthesized organic molecule discovered by chemistry professor Richard Silverman, which ultimately was marketed as Lyrica, a drug sold by Pfizer, to combat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia. INVO has been involved in creating a number of centers, including the Center for Developmental Therapeutics (CDT) and the Center for Device Development (CD2).

The Clock Tower at the Rebecca Crown Center glows purple, instead of its usual white, after a winning game, thereby proclaiming the happy news. The Clock Tower remains purple until a loss or until the end of the sports season.
