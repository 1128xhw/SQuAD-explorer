It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite &quot;in the near future&quot;. The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose technology enabled the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the united States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German rocket technology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was able to launch the first orbiting satellite?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first human in space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yuri Gagarin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Apollo 11 land on the moon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 20, 1969</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did the Space Race begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 2, 1955</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sputnik 1 started orbiting on what date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 4, 1957</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person in space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yuri Gagarin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date that the first human reached space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 12, 1961</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Space Race can trace its origins to Germany, beginning in the 1930s and continuing during World War II when Nazi Germany researched and built operational ballistic missiles. Starting in the early 1930s, during the last stages of the Weimar Republic, German aerospace engineers experimented with liquid-fueled rockets, with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances. The head of the German Army's Ballistics and Munitions Branch, Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker, gathered a small team of engineers that included Walter Dornberger and Leo Zanssen, to figure out how to use rockets as long-range artillery in order to get around the Treaty of Versailles' ban on research and development of long-range cannons. Wernher von Braun, a young engineering prodigy, was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret army program at Kummersdorf-West in 1932. Von Braun had dreams about conquering outer space with rockets, and did not initially see the military value in missile technology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the actual origin of the Space Race?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were German aerospace engineers experimenting with in the 1930's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">liquid-fueled rockets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What engineer was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wernher von Braun</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which war in history did the Space Race begin to take root?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A secretive army installation began in Kummersdorf-West in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1932</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Second World War, General Dornberger was the military head of the army's rocket program, Zanssen became the commandant of the Peenemünde army rocket centre, and von Braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program. They would lead the team that built the Aggregate-4 (A-4) rocket, which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943. By 1943, Germany began mass-producing the A-4 as the Vergeltungswaffe 2 (&quot;Vengeance Weapon&quot; 2, or more commonly, V2), a ballistic missile with a 320 kilometers (200 mi) range carrying a 1,130 kilograms (2,490 lb) warhead at 4,000 kilometers per hour (2,500 mph). Its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it, and radar detection provided little warning. Germany used the weapon to bombard southern England and parts of Allied-liberated western Europe from 1944 until 1945. After the war, the V-2 became the basis of early American and Soviet rocket designs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was von Braun's role in the army's rocket program during during World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">technical director of the ballistic missile program</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first vehicle to reach outer space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Aggregate-4</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During WWII, who was in charge of the German army's rocket program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> General Dornberger</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first object to enter space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aggregate-4 (A-4) rocket</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Aggregate-4 (A-4) rocket reach space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1942 and 1943</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At war's end, American, British, and Soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture Germany's rocket engineers along with the German rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based.

He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s, but was arrested in 1938 during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge and imprisoned for six years in Siberia. After the war, he became the USSR's chief rocket and spacecraft engineer, essentially the Soviet counterpart to von Braun.

They were not allowed to participate in Soviet missile design, but were used as problem-solving consultants to the Soviet engineers. They helped in the following areas: the creation of a Soviet version of the A-4; work on &quot;organizational schemes&quot;; research in improving the A-4 main engine; development of a 100-ton engine; assistance in the &quot;layout&quot; of plant production rooms; and preparation of rocket assembly using German components. With their help, particularly Helmut Groettrup's group, Korolev reverse-engineered the A-4 and built his own version of the rocket, the R-1, in 1948. Later, he developed his own distinct designs, though many of these designs were influenced by the Groettrup Group's G4-R10 design from 1949. The Germans were eventually repatriated in 1951–53.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the R1 rocket born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1948</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The American professor Robert H.

These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space, and the first two-stage rocket, the WAC Corporal-V2 combination, in 1949. The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army's new Redstone Arsenal, located in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950. From here, von Braun and his team would develop the Army's first operational medium-range ballistic missile, the Redstone rocket, that would, in slightly modified versions, launch both America's first satellite, and the first piloted Mercury space missions.

The United States faced a new uncertainty beginning in September 1949, when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb. American intelligence agencies discovered that the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb, with the consequence that the United States potentially could face a future nuclear war that, for the first time, might devastate its cities. Given this new danger, the United States participated in an arms race with the Soviet Union that included development of the hydrogen bomb, as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of delivering nuclear weapons. A new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the United States during the 1950s, which devolved into paranoid McCarthyism. With communism spreading in China, Korea, and Eastern Europe, Americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive &quot;witch-hunts&quot; to expose communist spies. Part of the American reaction to the Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large Air Force, under the control of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). SAC employed intercontinental strategic bombers, as well as medium-bombers based close to Soviet airspace (in western Europe and in Turkey) that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the US lose its monopoly to the atomic bomb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of bomb was first developed during the Cold War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the hydrogen bomb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">ICBMs is an abbreviation for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The SAC is an abbreviation for what US force?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Strategic Air Command</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what decade, did a fear of communism oversweep the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For its part, the Soviet Union harbored fears of invasion.

The United States had used these weapons operationally during World War II, and it could use them again against the Soviet Union, laying waste its cities and military centers.

He was concerned that the Soviet Union would accuse the Americans of an illegal overflight, thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense. Eisenhower and his advisors believed that a nation's airspace sovereignty did not extend into outer space, acknowledged as the Kármán line, and he used the 1957–58 International Geophysical Year launches to establish this principle in international law. Eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a &quot;warmonger&quot; if he were to use military missiles as launchers. Therefore, he selected the untried Naval Research Laboratory's Vanguard rocket, which was a research-only booster. This meant that von Braun's team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their Jupiter-C rocket, because of its intended use as a future military vehicle. On September 20, 1956, von Braun and his team did launch a Jupiter-C that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit, but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of nose cone reentry technology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A Jupiter-C was launched by Von Braum on what date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 20, 1956</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Soviet success caused public controversy in the United States, and Eisenhower ordered the civilian rocket and satellite project, Vanguard, to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned.

It was a monumental failure, exploding a few seconds after launch, and it became an international joke. The satellite appeared in newspapers under the names Flopnik, Stayputnik, Kaputnik, and Dudnik. In the United Nations, the Russian delegate offered the U.S. representative aid &quot;under the Soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations.&quot; Only in the wake of this very public failure did von Braun's Redstone team get the go-ahead to launch their Jupiter-C rocket as soon as they could. In Britain, the USA's Western Cold War ally, the reaction was mixed: some members of the population celebrated the fact that the Soviets had reached space first, while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The civilian rocket and satellite project in the US was called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vanguard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Project Vanguard launch failed on what date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> December 6, 195</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Cape Canaveral Air Force Station is located in what state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Florida</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in response to Project Vanguard's failed launch, what was the rocket the Soviet Union launched?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jupiter-C rocket</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On January 31, 1958, nearly four months after the launch of Sputnik 1, von Braun and the United States successfully launched its first satellite on a four-stage Juno I rocket derived from the US Army's Redstone missile, at Cape Canaveral. The satellite Explorer 1 was 30.8 pounds (14.0 kg) in mass. It carried a micrometeorite gauge and a Geiger-Müller tube. It passed in and out of the Earth-encompassing radiation belt with its 194-by-1,368-nautical-mile (360 by 2,534 km) orbit, therefore saturating the tube's capacity and proving what Dr. James Van Allen, a space scientist at the University of Iowa, had theorized. The belt, named the Van Allen radiation belt, is a doughnut-shaped zone of high-level radiation intensity around the Earth above the magnetic equator. Van Allen was also the man who designed and built the satellite instrumentation of Explorer 1. The satellite actually measured three phenomena: cosmic ray and radiation levels, the temperature in the spacecraft, and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorites. The satellite had no memory for data storage, therefore it had to transmit continuously. Two months later in March 1958, a second satellite was sent into orbit with augmented cosmic ray instruments.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The first US satellite to launch without failure was on what date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 31, 1958</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Explorer gathered what 3 measurements?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cosmic ray and radiation levels, the temperature in the spacecraft, and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorite</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On April 2, 1958, President Eisenhower reacted to the Soviet space lead in launching the first satellite, by recommending to the US Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities.

On April 12, 1961, the USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1. They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut, roughly translated from Russian and Greek as &quot;sailor of the universe&quot;. Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer, it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution; medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space. Vostok 1 orbited the Earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the Soviet Union, with Gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7,000 meters (23,000 ft), and landing by parachute. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (International Federation of Aeronautics) credited Gagarin with the world's first human space flight, although their qualifying rules for aeronautical records at the time required pilots to take off and land with their craft. For this reason, the Soviet Union omitted from their FAI submission the fact that Gagarin did not land with his capsule. When the FAI filing for Gherman Titov's second Vostok flight in August 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique, the FAI committee decided to investigate, and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch, orbiting, and return, rather than the manner of landing, and so revised their rules accordingly, keeping Gagarin's and Titov's records intact.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country succesfully launched the first person into space in 1961?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the USSR</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The first ship to carry a human through space was called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vostok 1</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Yuri Gagarin orbit the earth in the spacecraft?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">108 minutes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity.

The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission: it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt-sleeve-environment. However, flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft's environmental systems; rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft's limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits. Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization. This feat would not be repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968; this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt-sleeve environment while in space.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was the first successful three man astronaut crew?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 12, 1964</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The first flight in a spacecraft that allowed no suits to be worn inside was was?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Voskhod 1</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The US Apollo Command Module flew without spacesuits in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1968</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Between October 14–16, 1964, Leonid Brezhnev and a small cadre of high-ranking Communist Party officials, deposed Khrushchev as Soviet government leader a day after Voskhod 1 landed, in what was called the &quot;Wednesday conspiracy&quot;.

Leonov performed the first-ever EVA as part of the mission. A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonov's spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space, preventing him from re-entering the airlock. In order to overcome this, he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level. He succeeded in safely re-entering the ship, but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecraft's atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45% pure oxygen, which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re-entry. The reentry involved two more challenges: an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers (240 mi) off its designated target area, the town of Perm; and the instrument compartment's failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Voskhod 2 carrying two humans was launched on what date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> March 18, 1965</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person to take a spacewalk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexey Leonov</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of two Voskhod 2's occupants was almost killed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexey Leonov</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions.

The mission was planned to be a three-day test, to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2, but the mission was plagued with problems. Early on, Komarov's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed. Then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely, resulting in the craft spinning wildly. Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system, which was only partially effective. The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day. During the emergency re-entry, a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail, and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute; Komarov was killed on impact.

They also planned an Apollo Applications Program to develop a longer-duration Earth orbital workshop (later named Skylab) to be constructed in orbit from a spent S-IVB upper stage, using several launches of the smaller Saturn IB launch vehicle. But planners soon decided this could be done more efficiently by using the two live stages of a Saturn V to launch the workshop pre-fabricated from an S-IVB (which was also the Saturn V third stage), which immediately removed Apollo 20. Belt-tightening budget cuts soon led NASA to cut Apollo 18 and 19 as well, but keep three extended/Lunar Rover missions. Apollo 13 encountered an in-flight spacecraft failure and had to abort its lunar landing in April 1970, returning its crew safely but temporarily grounding the program again.

The crew became the second in-flight space fatality during their reentry on June 30. They were asphyxiated when their spacecraft's cabin lost all pressure, shortly after undocking.
