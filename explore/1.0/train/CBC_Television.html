Most CBC-owned stations previously signed off the air during the early morning hours (typically from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.). Instead of the infomercials aired by most private stations, or a simulcast of CBC News Network in the style of BBC One's nightly simulcast of BBC News Channel, the CBC uses the time to air repeats, including local news, primetime series, movies and other programming from the CBC library. Its French counterpart, Ici Radio-Canada Télé, still signs off every night.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was CBC one of the first or last stations to adopt a 24 hour schedule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> last </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did stations previously sign off the air?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early morning hours (typically from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did private stations air when programming was not ticketed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> infomercials </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does CBC use unallotted airtime for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> local news, primetime series, movies and other programming from the CBC library</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which French station has refused to adopt a 24 hour schedule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ici Radio-Canada Télé</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Until 1998, the network carried a variety of American programs in addition to its core Canadian programming, directly competing with private Canadian broadcasters such as CTV and Global.

Since this change, the CBC has sometimes struggled to maintain ratings comparable to those it achieved before 1995, although it has seen somewhat of a ratings resurgence in recent years.

This second airing was later replaced with other programming, and as of the 2012-13 television season, was replaced on CBC's major market stations by a half-hour late newscast.

It has been televised by the network since 1952. During the NHL lockout and subsequent cancellation of the 2004-2005 hockey season, CBC instead aired various recent and classic movies, branded as Movie Night in Canada, on Saturday nights. Many cultural groups criticized this and suggested the CBC air games from minor hockey leagues; the CBC responded that most such broadcast rights were already held by other groups, but it did base each Movie Night broadcast from a different Canadian hockey venue. Other than hockey, CBC Sports properties include Toronto Raptors basketball, Toronto FC Soccer, and various other amateur and professional events.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did HNIC begin being broadcasted on CBC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1952</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did CBC air during the NHL lockout?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">various recent and classic movies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what nights does CBC generally reserve broadcasting for hockey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saturday</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did CBC call it's movie showings during the NHL Lockout?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Movie Night in Canada</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It was also the exclusive carrier of Canadian Curling Association events during the 2004–2005 season.

CBC O&amp;O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O&amp;O stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are &quot;CB&quot; (an ITU prefix allocated not to Canada, but to Chile) and the last letter is &quot;T&quot;. Only the third letter varies from market to market; however, that letter is typically the same as the third letter of the CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 stations in the same market. An exception to this rule are the CBC North stations in Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, whose call signs begin with &quot;CF&quot; due to their historic association with the CBC's Frontier Coverage Package prior to the advent of microwave and satellite broadcasting.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What station does not identify itself by its call letters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Toronto's CBLT</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who owns and operates most of the CBC television stations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CBC itself</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the first two letters of nearly all CBC stations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;CB&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the last letter of nearly all CBC stations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;T&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which stations break convention and begin with &quot;CF&quot; instead of &quot;CB&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CBC North</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some stations that broadcast from smaller cities are private affiliates of the CBC, that is, stations which are owned by commercial broadcasters but predominantly incorporate CBC programming within their schedules.

However, they may opt out of some CBC programming in order to air locally produced programs, syndicated series or programs purchased from other broadcasters, such as CTV Two, which do not have a broadcast outlet in the same market. In these cases, the CBC programming being displaced may be broadcast at a different time than the network, or may not be broadcast on the station at all. Most private affiliates generally opt out of CBC's afternoon schedule and Thursday night arts programming. Private affiliates carry the 10 p.m. broadcast of The National as a core part of the CBC schedule, but generally omitted the 11 p.m. repeat (which is no longer broadcast).

One private CBC affiliate, CHBC-TV in Kelowna, joined E! (then known as CH) on February 27, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliates with another network, the CBC has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest O&amp;O station to ensure that CBC service is continued. However, due to an agreement between CHBC and CFJC-TV in Kamloops, CFJC also disaffiliated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. Former private CBC affiliates CKPG-TV Prince George and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat disaffiliated on August 31, 2008 and joined E!, but the CBC announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas. Incidentally, CFJC, CKPG and CHAT are all owned by an independent media company, Jim Pattison Group.

Incidentally, that was also the date for analogue to digital transition in Canada. Given recent practice and the CBC's decision not to convert any retransmitters to digital, even in markets with populations in the hundreds in thousands, it is not expected that the CBC will open new transmitters to replace its affiliates, and indeed may pare back its existing transmitter network. However, in March 2011, CKPR announced that it had come to a programming agreement with the CBC, in which the station will continue to provide CBC programming in Thunder Bay for a period of five years. On March 16, 2012, Astral Media announced the sale of its assets to Bell Media, owners of CTV and CTV Two, for $3.38 billion with CFTK and CJDC included in the acquisition.

As of September 2010 CBC shut down its analogue transmitter and decided not to replace it with a digital transmitter. As a result, there is now a giant hole in the coverage of CBC in South-Western Ontario. Both CBC - Toronto and CBC - Windsor are both over 100 miles from London, ON and out of range for even the largest antennas[citation needed].</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did CBC shut down its analogue transmitter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 2010</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which CBC location has a lapsed area of coverage after 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South-Western Ontario</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which US city can receive broadcasts from CBC's London transmitter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ashtabula, Ohio</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>CBC's sports coverage has also attained high viewership in border markets, including its coverage of the NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs, which was generally considered to be more complete and consistent than coverage by other networks such as NBC. Its coverage of the Olympic Games also found a significant audience in border regions, primarily due to the fact that CBC aired more events live than NBC's coverage, which had been criticized in recent years for tape delaying events to air in primetime, even if the event is being held in a market in the Pacific Time Zone during primetime hours on the East (where it would still be delayed for West coast primetime).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is CBC's coverage preferable to other networks in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more complete and consistent </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did CBC air more or less live Olympic events than NBC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was NBC criticized over its Olympic coverage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> tape delaying events to air in primetime</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While its fellow Canadian broadcasters converted most of their transmitters to digital by the Canadian digital television transition deadline of August 31, 2011, CBC converted only about half of the analogue transmitters in mandatory areas to digital (15 of 28 markets with CBC Television stations, and 14 of 28 markets with Télévision de Radio-Canada stations). Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline. Under this plan, communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air signals as of the deadline. Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and Radio-Canada transmitters in mandatory markets. Mandatory markets losing both CBC and Radio-Canada over-the-air signals include London, Ontario (metropolitan area population 457,000) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (metro area population 257,000). In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only ones that were not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the deadline for converstion to digital transmission from analogue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 31, 2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of CBC's mandatory transmitters were updated before the deadline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only about half</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two large metropolitan areas lost CBC and Radio-Canada broadcasts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London, Ontario (metropolitan area population 457,000) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (metro area population 257,000)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because rebroadcast transmitters were not planned to be converted to digital, many markets stood to lose over-the-air coverage from CBC or Radio-Canada, or both.

In mid-August 2011, the CRTC granted the CBC an extension, until August 31, 2012, to continue operating its analogue transmitters in markets subject to the August 31, 2011 transition deadline. This CRTC decision prevented many markets subject to the transition deadline from losing signals for CBC or Radio-Canada, or both at the transition deadline. At the transition deadline, Barrie, Ontario lost both CBC and Radio-Canada signals as the CBC did not request that the CRTC allow these transmitters to continue operating.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was CBC's anologue upgrade extension set to expire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 31, 2012</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the deadline, which area lost broadcast entirely?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Barrie, Ontario </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did Barrie, Ontario lose signal for CBC, Radio-Canada, or both?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In markets where a digital transmitter was installed, existing coverage areas were not necessarily maintained.

According to the CBC, this would reduce the corporation's yearly costs by $10 million. No plans have been announced to use subchannels to maintain over-the-air signals for both CBC and Radio-Canada in markets where the corporation has one digital transmitter.
