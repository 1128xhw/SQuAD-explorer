Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a modern common occurence with antibiotics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">resistance of bacteria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is resistance to antibiotics a cause of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Luria-Delbruck experiment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1943 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two antibiotics that have high efficacy are much less useful now?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> penicillin and erythromycin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does emergence of resistance reflect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evolutionary processes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of antibiotic treatment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">survive high doses of antibiotics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was antibacterial-resistance demonstrated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1943</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made the demonstration in 1943?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Luria–Delbrück</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include host defense mechanisms, the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial. A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells. These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection. Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration, in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial. To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the potency of antibacterials depend upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">concentration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does this eliminate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> bacterial infection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the bactericidal activitty of antibacterials depend on what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bacterial growth phase</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What besides ongoing metabolic activity is required in bactericidal activity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">division of bacterial cells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the activity of antibacterials depends on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">concentration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a successful treatment using antibiotics entail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">host defense mechanisms, the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do you predict the clinical result?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes. Those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins and cephalosporins) or the cell membrane (polymyxins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities. Those that target protein synthesis (macrolides, lincosamides and tetracyclines) are usually bacteriostatic (with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides). Further categorization is based on their target specificity. &quot;Narrow-spectrum&quot; antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic lipopeptides (such as daptomycin), glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline), oxazolidinones (such as linezolid), and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do anitibiotics mostly target?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bacterial functions or growth processes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two types of antibiotics target the cell wall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">penicillins and cephalosporins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of antibiotic goes after the cell membrane?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polymyxins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 3 types go after protein synthesis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">(macrolides, lincosamides and tetracyclines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides sprectrum of activity and chemical structure, how can antibacterial antibiotics classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mechanism of action</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name used for bacterial cell wall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">penicillins and cephalosporins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">whats another word for cell membrane?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polymyxins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many new classes of antibacterial antibiotics was introduced in the late 2000's/</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What three ways are antibiotics classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With advances in medicinal chemistry, most modern antibacterials are semisynthetic modifications of various natural compounds.

Compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the aminoglycosides, whereas other antibacterials—for example, the sulfonamides, the quinolones, and the oxazolidinones—are produced solely by chemical synthesis. Many antibacterial compounds are relatively small molecules with a molecular weight of less than 2000 atomic mass units.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are antibiotics in chemical terms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">semisynthetic modifications</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of antibiotics include penicilin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">beta-lactam antibiotics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the type of antibiotics which are taken from still living things?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aminoglycosides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are the slufonamides,quinolones, and oxazolidinones created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">synthesis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides semisytetic modifications, what advances in medicinal chemistry regarding antibacterials?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> various natural compounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the molecular weight loss of antibacterial compounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000 atomic mass units</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is included in the beta-lactam antibiotics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> penicillins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is penicillins produced by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fungi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century, and have together with vaccination led to the near eradication of diseases such as tuberculosis in the developed world.

However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.

Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and for metabolic development. Mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)– with either penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. Moreover, research have shown that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to controlled mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (&lt;6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given macrolides compared to penicillin and cephalosporin. Therefore, there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one common result of using antibiotics from a young age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increased body mass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does STAT stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some antibiotics can be used for STAT?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do antibiotics cause obesity in humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unclear </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do physicians use antibiotics on infants when the relationship has been proven? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">weighed against the beneficial effects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can happen if people are exposed to antibiotics at a young age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increased body mass </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do intestinal microbiota develop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Early life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do antibiotics increase the chance of getting fat for humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unclear </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with contraceptive pills, such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%).

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is part of hje the make up of bacterial strains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Intrinsic antibacterial resistance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is exchanged between between bacterial strains or species via plasmids that have this resistance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antibacterial resistance genes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be absent from the bacterial genome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antibiotic target</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does the spread of antibacterial resistance frequently occurs/</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vertical transmission</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does some resistance come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mutation </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What method of spread can occur in antibacterial resistance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vertical transmission of mutations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do plasmids do in resistance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">carry several different resistance genes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as &quot;superbugs&quot;, now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled.

Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, &quot;if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics&quot;. The term 'antibiosis', meaning &quot;against life&quot;, was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist, in 1942. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What methods did people use before antibiotics to treat infections?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medicinal folklore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were some kinds of antimicrobials first used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 2000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of things did Egyptians and Greeks use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mold and plant materials and extracts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does antibiosis mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">against life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who came up with the term antibiosis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean Paul Vuillemin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history (see: History of penicillin).

Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during the war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first antibiotic developed from nature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tyrothricin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was tyrothricin created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1939</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What also happened in 1939 besides tyrothricin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">start of World War II,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered tyrothricin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rene Dubos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was tyrothricin used for during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> wounds and ulcers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, penicillin G, in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was penicillin G first purified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1942</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did penicillin G become available outside of military use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1945</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who came up with a way to quickly produce penicillin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Norman Heatley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the chemical make-up of penicillin discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1945</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered the chemical structure of penicillin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Vaccines rely on immune modulation or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of macrophages, the production of antibodies, inflammation, and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases. Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic, cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components, including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates, to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do vaccines need to work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">immune modulation or augmentation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of vaccines have saved millions of lives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antibacterial vaccines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of vaccines have been phased out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria. The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect &quot;good&quot; bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been talked about to treat resistant bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phage therapy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How have researchers been doing this?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infecting pathogenic bacteria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a worry of using phages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phages will infect &quot;good&quot; bacteria</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In April 2013, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) reported that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria's increasing ability to develop resistance. Since 2009, only 2 new antibiotics were approved in the United States. The number of new antibiotics approved for marketing per year declines continuously. The report identified seven antibiotics against the Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) currently in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials. However, these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of resistance of GNB.

Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act aims to fast track the drug development to combat the growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, &quot;By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who regulates antibiotic approval?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FDA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could help to spur pharmaceuticals to make new antibiotics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">economic incentives</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are resistant bacteria called in the media?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">superbugs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is a director at the Pew Charitable Trusts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Allan Coukell,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
