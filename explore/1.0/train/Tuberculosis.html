Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term &quot;consumption&quot; came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bacterium causes tuberculosis infection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What primary body part is affected by tuberculosis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lungs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Roughly, what percentage of latent tuberculosis infections result in active tuberculosis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with cough, weight loss, and night sweats, what's the fourth classic symptom of the disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fever</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name has been used to refer to tuberculosis because of associated weight loss?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">consumption</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB.

Occasionally, people may cough up blood in small amounts, and in very rare cases, the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen's aneurysm, resulting in massive bleeding. Tuberculosis may become a chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs. The upper lung lobes are more frequently affected by tuberculosis than the lower ones.

Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), the central nervous system (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. When it spreads to the bones, it is also known as &quot;osseous tuberculosis&quot;, a form of osteomyelitis. Sometimes, bursting of a tubercular abscess through skin results in tuberculous ulcer. An ulcer originating from nearby infected lymph nodes is painless, slowly enlarging and has an appearance of &quot;wash leather&quot;. A potentially more serious, widespread form of TB is called &quot;disseminated tuberculosis&quot;, also known as miliary tuberculosis.

A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (&quot;overt&quot;) TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.

Macrophages identify the bacterium as foreign and attempt to eliminate it by phagocytosis. During this process, the bacterium is enveloped by the macrophage and stored temporarily in a membrane-bound vesicle called a phagosome. The phagosome then combines with a lysosome to create a phagolysosome. In the phagolysosome, the cell attempts to use reactive oxygen species and acid to kill the bacterium. However, M. tuberculosis has a thick, waxy mycolic acid capsule that protects it from these toxic substances.

Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system. However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system. Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles.

Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is poor.

Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250M rural migrants in China.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What member of leadership at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria called TB a &quot;pandemic&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mark Dybul</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country covers treatment for tuberculosis for its citizens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brazil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization said some countries might be spending as much as $150 billion each year on TB?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World Bank</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What population segment in China struggles to get follow-up care for TB infection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rural migrants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some people think we need more of to prevent for-profit providers of TB treatment from over-prescribing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">regulations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One way to decrease stigma may be through the promotion of &quot;TB clubs&quot;, where those infected may share experiences and offer support, or through counseling. Some studies have shown TB education programs to be effective in decreasing stigma, and may thus be effective in increasing treatment adherence. Despite this, studies on relationship between reduced stigma and mortality are lacking as of 2010, and similar efforts to decrease stigma surrounding AIDS have been minimally effective. Some have claimed the stigma to be worse than the disease, and healthcare providers may unintentionally reinforce stigma, as those with TB are often perceived as difficult or otherwise undesirable. A greater understanding of the social and cultural dimensions of tuberculosis may also help with stigma reduction.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What groups might help tuberculosis patients share with and support each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">TB clubs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Education about TB seems to decrease the stigma of the disease and lead to what other positive effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increasing treatment adherence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some people say is even worse than the effects of tuberculosis itself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the stigma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of people can add to the TB stigma by treating patients as troublesome or unwanted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">healthcare providers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As recently as what year were there no studies on how TB mortality is connected to stigma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The BCG vaccine has limitations, and research to develop new TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches are being used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus.
