Early humans in the Lower Paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands, which allowed them to collect seafood, eggs, nuts, and fruits besides scavenging. Rather than killing large animals for meat, according to this view, they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes.

This specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools, like fishing nets and hooks and bone harpoons. The transition into the subsequent Neolithic period is chiefly defined by the unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices.

In the resulting competition for land use, hunter-gatherer societies either adopted these practices or moved to other areas. In addition, Jared Diamond has blamed a decline in the availability of wild foods, particularly animal resources. In North and South America, for example, most large mammal species had gone extinct by the end of the Pleistoceneâ€”according to Diamond, because of overexploitation by humans, although the overkill hypothesis he advocates is strongly contested.[by whom?]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do many modern day hunter-gatherers live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the developing world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what type of climate do hunter-gatherers live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arid regions or tropical forests</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of human life-style is pushing hunter-gatherers out of their environment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">settlements of agriculturalists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has Jared Diamond blamed the decline of gatherers on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">availability of wild foods</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of food animal went extict by the end of the Pleistocene era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large mammal species</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the number and size of agricultural societies increased, they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter-gatherers.

It might be imagined that this arrangement oppresses women, keeping them in the domestic sphere. However, according to some observers, hunter-gatherer women would not understand this interpretation. Since childcare is collective, with every baby having multiple mothers and male carers, the domestic sphere is not atomised or privatised but an empowering place to be.[citation needed] In all hunter-gatherer societies, women appreciate the meat brought back to camp by men. An illustrative account is Megan Biesele's study of the southern African Ju/'hoan, 'Women Like Meat'. Recent archaeological research suggests that the sexual division of labor was the fundamental organisational innovation that gave Homo sapiens the edge over the Neanderthals, allowing our ancestors to migrate from Africa and spread across the globe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What value system do Western scholars tend to use in analyzing societies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western values</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does most of the gathering in a hunter-gatherer society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">women</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group members are the big game hunters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">men</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the argument over women as gathers said to produce ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arrangement oppresses women</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is childcare viewed in a hunter-gatherer society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">childcare is collective</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To this day, most hunter-gatherers have a symbolically structured sexual division of labour. However, it is true that in a small minority of cases, women hunt the same kind of quarry as men, sometimes doing so alongside men. The best-known example are the Aeta people of the Philippines. According to one study, &quot;About 85% of Philippine Aeta women hunt, and they hunt the same quarry as men. Aeta women hunt in groups and with dogs, and have a 31% success rate as opposed to 17% for men. Their rates are even better when they combine forces with men: mixed hunting groups have a full 41% success rate among the Aeta.&quot; Among the Ju'/hoansi people of Namibia, women help men track down quarry. Women in the Australian Martu also primarily hunt small animals like lizards to feed their children and maintain relations with other women.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is labor often divided in these groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sexual division</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Aeta women hunt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">85%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the success rate of Aeta female hunters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">31%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the success rate for male Aeta hunters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the 1966 &quot;Man the Hunter&quot; conference, anthropologists Richard Borshay Lee and Irven DeVore suggested that egalitarianism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires minimization of material possessions throughout a population.

According to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more leisure than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well. Their &quot;affluence&quot; came from the idea that they were satisfied with very little in the material sense. Later, in 1996, Ross Sackett performed two distinct meta-analyses to empirically test Sahlin's view. The first of these studies looked at 102 time-allocation studies, and the second one analyzed 207 energy-expenditure studies. Sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work, on average, about 6.5 hours a day, where as people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average 8.8 hours a day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who called hunter-gathers the original affluent society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marshall Sahlins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Ross Sackett study time and energy for hunter-gartherer groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long a day do people in other societies work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8.8 hours a day</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mutual exchange and sharing of resources (i.e., meat gained from hunting) are important in the economic systems of hunter-gatherer societies.
