Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the &quot;Han people&quot; and the Chinese script is referred to as &quot;Han characters&quot;. It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC – 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25–220 AD).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What period followed the Han dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Three Kingdoms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty came before the Han dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Han dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liu Bang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Former Han period begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">206 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Later Han period end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">220 AD</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in AD 1911.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Qing dynasty fall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AD 1911</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What innovation was acquired from the Qin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">commanderies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosphy in education was sanctioned by the Chinese court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Confucianism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was an attributing factor that caused kingdoms to lose their Independence during the Han dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Rebellion of the Seven States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What class did a majority of appointed ministers come from during the Han dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scholarly gentry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Han dynasty was an age of economic prosperity and saw a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including papermaking, the nautical steering rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the central government issue coins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">119 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What industry did the government use to help pay for its military campaigns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what period did several government monopolies become repealed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eastern Han</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A money based economy was first entrenched in what dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zhou</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A seismometer during the Han dynasty used what type of pendulum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inverted</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Xiongnu, a nomadic steppe confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner, but continued their raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which confederation defeated the Han in 200 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Xiongnu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of campaign helped establish the Silk Road?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Nanyue annexed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">111 BC </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which confederation conquered the territories north of the Han's border?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xianbei</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Emperor Wu of Han's reign end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">87 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After 92 AD, the palace eunuchs increasingly involved themselves in court politics, engaging in violent power struggles between the various consort clans of the empresses and empress dowagers, causing the Han's ultimate downfall. Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large Daoist religious societies which instigated the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion. Following the death of Emperor Ling (r. 168–189 AD), the palace eunuchs suffered wholesale massacre by military officers, allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and divide the empire.

The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui. Liu Bang assumed the title &quot;emperor&quot; (huangdi) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC). Chang'an was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what action did the Qin bring together the Chinese Warring States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conquest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which commander did Liu Bang defeat in the Battle of Gaixia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xiang Yu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first emperor during the Qin dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qin Shi Huangdi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ultimately caused the Qin dynasty's authority to be dissolved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rebellion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who urged Liu Bang to become emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his followers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the beginning of the Western Han dynasty, thirteen centrally controlled commanderies—including the capital region—existed in the western third of the empire, while the eastern two-thirds were divided into ten semi-autonomous kingdoms. To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed some of them as kings. By 157 BC, the Han court had replaced all of these kings with royal Liu family members, since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned. After several insurrections by Han kings—the largest being the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC—the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies. Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff; this duty was assumed by the imperial court. Kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes. The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many commanderies were in the western third of the empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thirteen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who could appoint staff to the kings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">imperial court</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Rebellion of the Seven States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">154 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what source did kings derive their personal income from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tax revenues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Han court replaced several kings with members of what royal family?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liu</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To the north of China proper, the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu (r. 209–174 BC) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe. By the end of his reign, he controlled Manchuria, Mongolia, and the Tarim Basin, subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand. Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders, and he established a trade embargo against the group. Although the embargo was in place, the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs. Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets. In retaliation, the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province, where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC. After negotiations, the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance, but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes, food, and wine to the Xiongnu.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the chieftain of the Xiongnu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Modu Chanyu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group had a trade embargo created against them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Xiongnu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were Han forces defeated in Baideng?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agreement established equality between the Xiongnu and the Han?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heqin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of clothing were sent as a tribute to the Xiongnu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silk clothes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite the tribute and a negotiation between Laoshang Chanyu (r. 174–160 BC) and Emperor Wen (r. 180–157 BC) to reopen border markets, many of the Chanyu's Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods. In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) in 135 BC, the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids. However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han. When this plot failed in 133 BC, Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory. Chinese armies captured one stronghold after another and established agricultural colonies to strengthen their hold. The assault culminated in 119 BC at the Battle of Mobei, where the Han commanders Huo Qubing (d. 117 BC) and Wei Qing (d. 106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The heqin agreement was reaffirmed by a court conference in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">135 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Emperor Wu begin a series of attacks in Xiongnu territories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">133 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of colony did Chinese armies use to help firm their hold on the strongholds that they had taken over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">agricultural</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Battle of Mobei take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">119 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Han commander died in the year 106 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wei Qing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 121 BC, Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur.

He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants. These monopolies included salt, iron, and liquor production, as well as bronze-coin currency. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty. The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. The Reformists, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, frugal budget reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made up the bulk of the administrators of the new government monopolies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">former merchants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the liquor monopoly abolished?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">81 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which faction did the Reformists oppose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Modernist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which political faction favored budgetary reform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Reformists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Huo Guang die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">68 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to outlaw slavery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wang Mang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the water level in the Yellow River to increase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gradual silt buildup</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created a dam in the southern branch of The Yellow River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Han engineers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What emptied out to the south of the Shandong Peninsula?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Yellow River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the end of Wang Mang's regime?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">massive floods</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The period between the foundation of the Han dynasty and Wang Mang's reign is known as the Western Han dynasty (simplified Chinese: 西汉; traditional Chinese: 西漢; pinyin: Xī Hàn) or Former Han dynasty (simplified Chinese: 前汉; traditional Chinese: 前漢; pinyin: Qiánhàn) (206 BC – 9 AD).

At the Battle of Ikh Bayan in AD 89, Dou Xian (d. AD 92) defeated the Northern Xiongnu chanyu who then retreated into the Altai Mountains. After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the Ili River valley in AD 91, the nomadic Xianbei occupied the area from the borders of the Buyeo Kingdom in Manchuria to the Ili River of the Wusun people.

Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased.

Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe. The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD. A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophy was given exclusivity in the court during the rule of Emperor Wu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Confucianism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who put an end to all erudites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emperor Wu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many students were in the Imperial University by the second century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 30,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of philosophy was available for individuals at the commanderies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Confucian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did teachers make their money from at private schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tuition payments</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some important texts were created and studied by scholars.

Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century AD, including the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters, Perfection of Wisdom, Shurangama Sutra, and Pratyutpanna Sutra.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During was era did Buddhism first appear in the region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eastern Han</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Emperor Ming of Han's reign end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">75 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophical practice did Liu Ying believe in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddhism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is believed to be the first Buddhist temple in this area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the White Horse Temple</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which century were important Buddhist notions translated to Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2nd century AD</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Han government, the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-dan salary-rank or higher.

However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers.

Thorp points out the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What building material was used primarily during the Han dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Timber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty can the oldest wooden buildings in China be dated to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is considered to be the last year of the Tang dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">907 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of object is the only evidence of Han's wooden constructions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ceramic roof tiles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the primary component of a palace hall during the Han dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Timber </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Though Han wooden structures decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick, stone, and rammed earth remain intact.

Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of the artisan-engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of scholars have provided proof that mechanical engineering was prominent during the Han period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Confucian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which philosopher described the invention of a belt drive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yang Xiong</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which engineer was responsible for first inventing the zoetrope lamp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ding Huan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be used as a support structure in incense burners?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gimbals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of invention was used to provide air conditioning for the palace buildings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rotary fan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources.

To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock, Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel. Zhang also invented a seismometer (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪) in 132 AD to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away.

Each organ of the body was associated with a particular phase. Illness was viewed as a sign that qi or &quot;vital energy&quot; channels leading to a certain organ had been disrupted. Thus, Han-era physicians prescribed medicine that was believed to counteract this imbalance. For example, since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase, medicinal ingredients associated with the wood phase could be used to heal an organ associated with the fire phase. To this end, the physician Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150–c. 219 AD) prescribed regulated diets rich in certain foods that were thought to cure specific illnesses. These are now known to be nutrition disorders caused by the lack of certain vitamins consumed in one's diet. Besides dieting, Han physicians also prescribed moxibustion, acupuncture, and calisthenics as methods of maintaining one's health.
