Both Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians venerate images and icons of Mary, given that the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 permitted their veneration with the understanding that those who venerate the image are venerating the reality of the person it represents, and the 842 Synod of Constantinople confirming the same.

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. &quot;Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.&quot; Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the &quot;Papists&quot; for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote polemics regarding Roman Catholic beliefs about Mary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Martin Luther</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year was the Immaculate Conception dogmatized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1854</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which pope was responsible for the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pope Pius IX </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Theotokos mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mother of God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Martin Luther preach a sermon on Marian devotion a month before his death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wittenberg </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Differences in feasts may also originate from doctrinal issues—the Feast of the Assumption is such an example.

This tradition can trace its origin to the Byzantine Empire, from c.500 AD, where blue was &quot;the colour of an empress&quot;. A more practical explanation for the use of this colour is that in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, the blue pigment was derived from the rock lapis lazuli, a stone imported from Afghanistan of greater value than gold. Beyond a painter's retainer, patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting. Hence, it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the Virgin in gowns of blue.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which color is traditionally used to portray Mary in paintings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rock was used as the source of blue pigment in paints in Medieval and Renaissance Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lapis lazuli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From which country was lapis lazuli imported?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Afghanistan </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Lapis lazuli was thought to be more valuable than which precious metal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gold</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ancient empire is thought to have started the tradition of portraying Mary in paintings using the color blue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantine Empire</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nontrinitarians, such as Unitarians, Christadelphians and Jehovah's Witnesses also acknowledge Mary as the biological mother of Jesus Christ, but do not recognise Marian titles such as &quot;Mother of God&quot; as these groups generally reject Christ's divinity.

All the member churches of the Anglican Communion affirm in the historic creeds that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary, and celebrates the feast days of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. This feast is called in older prayer books the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary on February 2. The Annunciation of our Lord to the Blessed Virgin on March 25 was from before the time of Bede until the 18th century New Year's Day in England. The Annunciation is called the &quot;Annunciation of our Lady&quot; in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. Anglicans also celebrate in the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin on 31 May, though in some provinces the traditional date of July 2 is kept. The feast of the St. Mary the Virgin is observed on the traditional day of the Assumption, August 15. The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin is kept on September 8.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name given to the Annunciation in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Annunciation of our Lady</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date do most Anglicans celebrate the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">31 May</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for the feast of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple in the Anglican Communion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date is the Presentation of Christ in the Temple celebrated by Anglicans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what day was the Annunciation tradtionally celebrated in England until the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Year's Day </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Protestants in general reject the veneration and invocation of the Saints.:1174 Protestants typically hold that Mary was the mother of Jesus, but was an ordinary woman devoted to God.

Other scholars contend that the Greek word heos (i.e., until) denotes a state up to a point, but does not mean that the state ended after that point, and that Matthew 1:25 does not confirm or deny the virginity of Mary after the birth of Jesus. According to Biblical scholar Bart Ehrman the Hebrew word almah, meaning young woman of childbearing age, was translated into Greek as parthenos, which only means virgin, in Isaiah 7:14, which is commonly believed by Christians to be the prophecy of the Virgin Mary referred to in Matthew 1:23. While Matthew and Luke give differing versions of the virgin birth, John quotes the uninitiated Philip and the disbelieving Jews gathered at Galilee referring to Joseph as Jesus's father.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who do Christians believe is prophesized in Isaiah 7:14?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Virgin Mary </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which verse in Matthew is believed to refer to Isaiah's prohecy of the Virgin Mary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1:23</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Gospel writer provided a version of the virgin birth that was different than Matthew's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Luke </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the English tranlation of the Greek word &quot;parthenos?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">virgin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the meaning of the Greek word &quot;heos?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">until</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The hagiography of Mary and the Holy Family can be contrasted with other material in the Gospels.

And looking at those who sat in a circle around him, Jesus said, 'These are my mother and my brothers.

Similarly Theologian Sergei Bulgakov wrote that the Orthodox view Mary as &quot;superior to all created beings&quot; and &quot;ceaselessly pray for her intercession&quot;. However, she is not considered a &quot;substitute for the One Mediator&quot; who is Christ. &quot;Let Mary be in honor, but let worship be given to the Lord&quot;, he wrote. Similarly, Catholics do not worship Mary as a divine being, but rather &quot;hyper-venerate&quot; her. In Roman Catholic theology, the term hyperdulia is reserved for Marian veneration, latria for the worship of God, and dulia for the veneration of other saints and angels.
