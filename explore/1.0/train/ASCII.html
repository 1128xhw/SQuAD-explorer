Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called &quot;ANSI escape code&quot; (or, more properly, a &quot;Control Sequence Introducer&quot;) beginning with ESC followed by a &quot;[&quot; (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation, as in the TECO and vi text editors.

Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were &quot;#$%_&amp;'() –  early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII !&quot;#$% were placed in second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters left, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9. This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers—​​following the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984)—​​and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The /? pair also dates to the No. 2, and the ,&lt; .&gt; pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift , (comma) or . (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the ;: pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly -* =+) to :* ;+ -=.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first typewritter with a shift key created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1878</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were used instead of 0 and 1? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What layout did the Teletype Model 33 use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do shift values for symbols on modern keyboards correspond closely to the ASCII table?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">do not correspond as closely</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Code 127 is officially named &quot;delete&quot; but the Teletype label was &quot;rubout&quot;.
