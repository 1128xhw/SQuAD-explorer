San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran's classic &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider (1969). Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), with its 17-minute-long title track, using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the band Blue Cheer from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Francisco</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What classic song did Blue Cheer cover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Summertime Blues&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the hit off Steppenwolf's self-titled debut lp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What movie featured that Steppenwolf single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Easy Rider</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The lyrics to &quot;Born To Be Wild&quot; contain the first reference to what hard rock style?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heavy metal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From outside the United Kingdom and the United States, the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 (Rush, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112. The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;, which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US. Their style, consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony, proved itself to be a large influence on later bands. They reached their commercial, and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose: A Rock Legend (1979). The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre. Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock (1977) and Highway to Hell (1979). Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The band Rush is what nationality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canadian </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the first three Rush albums?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rush, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nationality was Thin Lizzy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Irish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Thin Lizzy's hit single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Scorpions hailed from what country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity and spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the title of Bon Jovi's third lp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Slippery When Wet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many copies did this record sell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the band Europe's international hit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Final Countdown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Van Halen's 1986 album called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5150 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the new lead singer for Van Halen on 5150?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sammy Hagar</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit &quot;I Don't Want to Miss a Thing&quot;, which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (1993) and &quot;Always&quot; (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or &quot;pop-metal&quot; sound.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Aerosmith ballad debuted at number one on the charts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;I Don't Want to Miss a Thing&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of AC/DC's 1995 double lp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ballbreaker </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bon Jovi's 1995 album was called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">These Days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What commercially successful sub-genre emerged from the grunge movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">post-grunge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Aerosmith's album Get A Grip come out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1993</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, AC/DC and Van Halen. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others began to return to a hard rock sound. Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial peak in the 1980s, with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses, which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade.

Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s, evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a &quot;grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound&quot; on records such as James Cotton's &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; (1954). Other antecedents include Link Wray's instrumental &quot;Rumble&quot; in 1958, and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale, such as &quot;Let's Go Trippin'&quot; (1961) and &quot;Misirlou&quot; (1962).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What genre laid the roots for hard rock?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electric blues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who recorded &quot;Rumble&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Link Wray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was &quot;Rumble&quot; released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1958</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were two of Dick Dale's better known songs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Let's Go Trippin'&quot; (1961) and &quot;Misirlou&quot; (1962)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city's blues style produced hard rock precursors in electric blues?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Memphis </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones developed their hard rock sound with Exile on Main St. (1972). Initially receiving mixed reviews, according to critic Steve Erlewine it is now &quot;generally regarded as the Rolling Stones' finest album&quot;. They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (1974) and Black and Blue (1976). Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from Led Zeppelin III (1970) and Led Zeppelin IV (1971). The latter included the track &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio. Deep Purple continued to define hard rock, particularly with their album Machine Head (1972), which included the tracks &quot;Highway Star&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. In 1975 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left, going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year, vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake. 1970 saw The Who release Live at Leeds, often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album, and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album Who's Next, which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers. Subsequent albums, including Quadrophenia (1973), built on this sound before Who Are You (1978), their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer Keith Moon later that year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the landmark hard rock album recorded by the Rolling Stones in 1972?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Exile on Main St.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Led Zeppelin album featured the hit &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Led Zeppelin IV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two hard rock songs are featured on Deep Purple's Machine Head album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Highway Star&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Deep Purple's guitarist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ritchie Blackmore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the drummer for The Who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Keith Moon</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began to return to a hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the original lead singer of AC/DC who died?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bon Scott</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Led Zeppelin drummer who passed away?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Bonham</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What singer replaced Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ronnie James Dio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Ozzy Osbourne's first solo album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blizzard of Ozz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some thrash metal bands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music.

Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf, The Kingsmen's version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (1963) which made it a garage rock standard, and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts, including &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; by The Kinks (1964), &quot;My Generation&quot; by The Who (1965), &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; (1966) by The Yardbirds and &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; (1965) by The Rolling Stones. From the late 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. In contrast, hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were three Chicago blues players who influenced hard rock?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who recorded &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Kinks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">&quot;Shapes of Things&quot; was a 1966 single by what band?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Yardbirds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What garage rock classic was recorded by The Kingsmen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Louie Louie&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Rolling Stones release &quot;(I Can't Get No&quot; Satisfaction&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Emerging British acts included Free, who released their signature song &quot;All Right Now&quot; (1970), which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US. After the breakup of the band in 1973, vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company, whose eponymous first album (1974) was an international hit. The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock, evident in the works of Deep Purple, was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent. Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971, producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling, Hair of the Dog (1975), which contained the proto-power ballad &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s, Queen, after the release of Sheer Heart Attack (1974) and A Night at the Opera (1975), gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal, progressive rock, and even opera. The latter featured the single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Free break up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1973</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What band did Free lead singer Paul Rodgers help form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bad Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bad Company's self titled debut album was released in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1974</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nationality was the band Nazareth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scottish </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Queen's massive 1975 hit single called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Often categorised with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n' Dry, mixing glam-rock with heavy metal, and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade.

It was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene. This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe, with their albums Too Fast for Love (1981) and Shout at the Devil (1983) and, as the style grew, the arrival of bands such as Ratt, White Lion, Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot. Quiet Riot's album Metal Health (1983) was the first glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind, to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sub-genre of hard rock does Def Leppard belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the New Wave of British Heavy Metal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Def Leppard's second album called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">High 'n' Dry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the three Top 40 singles from Def Leppard's Pyromania album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;Foolin'&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What band had the first glam metal album to hit number one on the Billboard charts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quiet Riot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Motley Crue's album Shout At The Devil come out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1983</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade, alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK. This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a &quot;dirty&quot; sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes than their &quot;hair band&quot; predecessors. Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock, several, including Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden, were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal, while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock. However, all grunge bands shunned the macho, anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal. In the UK, Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of Nirvana's 1991 album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nevermind </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the hard rock style that emerged in the early 1990s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grunge </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some grunge bands with a strong 1970s influence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 1990s hard rock band had a big stadium rock sound?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stone Temple Pilots </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What element made Oasis unique among 1990s Britpop bands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a hard rock sound</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although Foo Fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts, with albums like In Your Honor (2005) reaching number two in the US and UK, many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity. Acts like Creed, Staind, Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs. They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether. Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K., Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry, whose breakthrough album 15 (2006) went platinum and spawned the single &quot;Sorry&quot; (2007), which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100. These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock or post punk revival, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon, and Queens of the Stone Age from the US, Three Days Grace from Canada, Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand. In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures, a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl, Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Foo Fighters album In Your Honor come out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Three Days Grace is from what country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The band Jet is from what country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What supergroup featured members of Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age and Led Zeppelin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Them Crooked Vultures</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of Buckcherry's 2007 hit single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Sorry&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music.

Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars.

Cream, in songs like &quot;I Feel Free&quot; (1966) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton. Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, The Jeff Beck Group. Dave Davies of The Kinks, Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend of The Who, Hendrix, Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion. The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in 1968 and, with the track &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has described the &quot;proto-metal roar&quot; of &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; while Ian MacDonald argued that &quot;their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the guitarist for the band Cream?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eric Clapton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the guitarist in the Kinks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dave Davies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who played guitar in The Who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pete Townshend</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did The White Album come out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1968 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Keith Richards is the guitarist of what band?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Rolling Stones</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the United States, macabre-rock pioneer Alice Cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album School's Out (1972). In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single &quot;(Don't Fear) The Reaper&quot;, which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot; (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo (1978).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who recorded the album School's Out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alice Cooper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tres Hombres is the name of an album by what band?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ZZ Top</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the lead singer of Montrose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sammy Hagar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Kiss' double live album Alive! came out in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1975 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had a hit single with &quot;(Don't Fear) The Reaper&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blue Öyster Cult</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s. After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track &quot;Jump&quot;, which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks. Heart, after floundering during the first half of the decade, made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit. The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades. Among the first were ZZ Top, who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles, beginning with &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin'&quot; (1983), which helped their albums Eliminator (1983) and Afterburner (1985) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively.

While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them. Heavy metal took on &quot;darker&quot; characteristics after Black Sabbath's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s. In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by hardcore punk, and which further differentiated the two styles.

All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath's lead into territory that was often &quot;darker and more menacing&quot;, hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Led Zeppelin's first two albums both came out in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1969</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of Deep Purple's hard rock 1970 album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In Rock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Black Sabbath's lyrics contained references to what cultural touchstones?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">occult and elements of Gothic horror</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the title of Black Sabbath's 1970 album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paranoid </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one band directly influenced by Black Sabbath?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Judas Priest</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK, hard rock's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade. Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held. Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock, with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos. However, new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s. 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner, who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s. Midwestern groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock. In 1978, Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen. He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping, showcased on the song &quot;Eruption&quot; from the album Van Halen, which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion, while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two genres made inroads on hard rock in the 1970s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disco in the US and punk rock in the UK</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What punk band's songs rarely exceeded two minutes in length?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Ramones</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were three midwestern hard rock bands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city was Van Halen originally from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Los Angeles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Van Halen instrumental showcased the guitar mastery of Eddie Van Halen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Eruption&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate, with Whitesnake's self-titled album (1987) selling over 17 million copies, outperforming anything in Coverdale's or Deep Purple's catalogue before or since. It featured the rock anthem &quot;Here I Go Again '87&quot; as one of 4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up Slip of the Tongue (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato, &quot;it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake&quot;. Aerosmith's comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. Crazy Nights (1987) by Kiss was the band's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK. Mötley Crüe with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for a hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released the best-selling début of all time, Appetite for Destruction (1987). With a &quot;grittier&quot; and &quot;rawer&quot; sound than most glam metal, it produced three top 10 hits, including the number one &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;. Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride (1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles. In the last years of the decade, the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump (1989) by Aerosmith, and Mötley Crüe's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles, a record for a hard rock act. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released their eponymous début (1989), reaching number six on the Billboard 200, but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many copies did Whitesnake's 1987 self title album sell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of Aerosmith's 1987 comeback album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Permanent Vacation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Def Leppard's album Hysteria churned out how many hit singles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Guns N Roses album was the second best selling debut of all time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Appetite for Destruction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Guns N Roses song became a number one single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with &quot;It's My Life&quot; from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, Just Push Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit &quot;Jaded&quot;, and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with &quot;Who Says You Can't Go Home&quot;, which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released another number one album, The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What hard rock supergroup contained members of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Audioslave</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of Bon Jovi's 2000 hit single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;It's My Life&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What band released an album called Stiff Upper Lip in 2000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AC/DC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scott Weiland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Guns N Roses long delayed 2008 album called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese Democracy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
