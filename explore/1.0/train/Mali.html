Mali is the eighth-largest country in Africa, with an area of just over 1,240,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi). The population of Mali is 14.5 million. Its capital is Bamako. Mali consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara Desert, while the country's southern part, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the Niger and Senegal rivers. The country's economy centers on agriculture and fishing. Some of Mali's prominent natural resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent, and salt. About half the population lives below the international poverty line of $1.25 (U.S.) a day. A majority of the population (55%) are non-denominational Muslims.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of Africa what rank in size country is Mali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mali is the eighth-largest country in Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Mali's capital named?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bamako</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two major rivers located inside of Mali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Niger and Senegal rivers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides salt what other major natural resources does Mali produce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prominent natural resources include gold</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">More than half of the population is what religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> (55%) are non-denominational Muslims</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Present-day Mali was once part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade: the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire (for which Mali is named), and the Songhai Empire. During its golden age, there was a flourishing of mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art. At its peak in 1300, the Mali Empire covered an area about twice the size of modern-day France and stretched to the west coast of Africa. In the late 19th century, during the Scramble for Africa, France seized control of Mali, making it a part of French Sudan. French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined with Senegal in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation. Shortly thereafter, following Senegal's withdrawal from the federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent Republic of Mali. After a long period of one-party rule, a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the latter part of the 19th century what country took control of Mali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France seized control of Mali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Mali gain independence as the Mali Federation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with a new constitution, Mali became what type of state in 1991?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mali as a democratic, multi-party state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mali was once part of how many West African empires?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Empire that the country is now named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mali Empire (for which Mali is named)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In January 2012, an armed conflict broke out in northern Mali, which Tuareg rebels took control of by April and declared the secession of a new state, Azawad.

His efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974, in which famine killed thousands of people.

Peaceful student protests in January 1991 were brutally suppressed, with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants.
