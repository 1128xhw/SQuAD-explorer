Sichuan was referred to in ancient Chinese sources as Ba-Shu (巴蜀), an abbreviation of the kingdoms of Ba and Shu which existed within the Sichuan Basin. Ba included Chongqing and the land in eastern Sichuan along the Yangtze and some tributary streams, while Shu included today's Chengdu, its surrounding plain and adjacent territories in western Sichuan.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Sichuan referred to as by ancient Chinese sources?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ba-Shu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far back can civilizations in the Yangtze region be dated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at least the 15th century BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the kingdoms of Ba and Shu located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">within the Sichuan Basin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What land was included in the kingdom of Ba?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chongqing and the land in eastern Sichuan along the Yangtze and some tributary streams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What land was included in the kingdom of Shu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hengdu, its surrounding plain and adjacent territories in western Sichuan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The existence of the early state of Shu was poorly recorded in the main historical records of China. It was, however, referred to in the Book of Documents as an ally of the Zhou. Accounts of Shu exist mainly as a mixture of mythological stories and historical legends recorded in local annals such as the Chronicles of Huayang compiled in the Jin dynasty (265–420), with folk stories such as that of Emperor Duyu (杜宇) who taught the people agriculture and transformed himself into a cuckoo after his death. The existence of a highly developed civilization with an independent bronze industry in Sichuan eventually came to light with an archaeological discovery in 1986 at a small village named Sanxingdui in Guanghan, Sichuan. This site, believed to be an ancient city of Shu, was initially discovered by a local farmer in 1929 who found jade and stone artefacts. Excavations by archaeologists in the area yielded few significant finds until 1986 when two major sacrificial pits were found with spectacular bronze items as well as artefacts in jade, gold, earthenware, and stone. This and other discoveries in Sichuan contest the conventional historiography that the local culture and technology of Sichuan were undeveloped in comparison to the technologically and culturally &quot;advanced&quot; Yellow River valley of north-central China. The name Shu continues to be used to refer to Sichuan in subsequent periods in Chinese history up to the present day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Emperor  Duyu transform himself into after his death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a cuckoo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the name Shu refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sichuan in subsequent periods in Chinese history up to the present day.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the site believed to be ancient city of Shu discovered, and by whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a local farmer in 1929</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Shu were an ally of who, according to the Book of Documents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Zhou</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Chronicles of Huayang compiled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Jin dynasty (265–420)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The rulers of the expansionist Qin dynasty, based in present-day Gansu and Shaanxi, were only the first strategists to realize that the area's military importance matched its commercial and agricultural significance.
