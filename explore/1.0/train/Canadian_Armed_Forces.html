More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the effort called to upgrade the Canadian Forces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Canada First Defence Strategy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were the Canadian Forces upgraded in 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through the purchase of new equipment, improved training and readiness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What major problem is the CAF trying to address currently?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">loss of existing members</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The 2006 renewal and re-equipment effort has resulted in the acquisition of specific equipment (main battle tanks, artillery, unmanned air vehicles and other systems) to support the mission in Afghanistan.

The Department further reviewed personnel policies in 1978 and 1985, after Parliament passed the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As a result of these reviews, the Department changed its policies to permit women to serve at sea in replenishment ships and in a diving tender, with the army service battalions, in military police platoons and field ambulance units, and in most air squadrons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What roles were women recruited for in the 1950s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medicine, communication, logistics, and administration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did further recruitment for women open in the CAF?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What non traditional tasks were women recruited for in the 1970s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vehicle drivers and mechanics, aircraft mechanics, air-traffic controllers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were women eventually allowed to serve at sea in the CAF?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Department changed its policies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What charter directly affected a women's right to serve in the CAF?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1987, occupations and units with the primary role of preparing for direct involvement in combat on the ground or at sea were still closed to women: infantry, armoured corps, field artillery, air-defence artillery, signals, field engineers, and naval operations.

Adherents of the Sikh faith may wear uniform turbans (dastar) (or patka, when operational) and Muslim women may wear uniform tucked hijabs under their authorized headdress. Jews may wear yarmulke under their authorized headdress and when bareheaded. The beret is probably the most widely worn headgear and is worn with almost all orders of dress (with the exception of the more formal orders of Navy and Air Force dress), and the colour of which is determined by the wearer's environment, branch, or mission. Naval personnel, however, seldom wear berets, preferring either service cap or authorized ballcaps (shipboard operational dress), which only the Navy wear. Air Force personnel, particularly officers, prefer the wedge cap to any other form of headdress. There is no naval variant of the wedge cap. The Yukon cap and tuque are worn only with winter dress, although clearance and combat divers may wear tuques year-round as a watch cap. Soldiers in Highland, Scottish, and Irish regiments generally wear alternative headdress, including the glengarry, balmoral, tam o'shanter, and caubeen instead of the beret. The officer cadets of both Royal Military Colleges wear gold-braided &quot;pillbox&quot; (cavalry) caps with their ceremonial dress and have a unique fur &quot;Astrakhan&quot; for winter wear.
