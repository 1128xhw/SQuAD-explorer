During the Second Civil War, leadership of the Umayyad clan shifted from the Sufyanid branch of the family to the Marwanid branch. As the constant campaigning exhausted the resources and manpower of the state, the Umayyads, weakened by the Third Muslim Civil War of 744–747 CE, were finally toppled by the Abbasid Revolution in 750 CE/132 AH. A branch of the family fled across North Africa to Al-Andalus, where they established the Caliphate of Córdoba, which lasted until 1031 before falling due to the Fitna of al-Ándalus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year CE did the Second Muslim Civil War end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">692 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what period did the Berber Revolt occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">740–743 CE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch took over Umayyad leadership during the Second Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marwanid </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ali was assassinated in 661 by a Kharijite partisan. Six months later in the same year, in the interest of peace, Hasan ibn Ali, highly regarded for his wisdom and as a peacemaker, and the Second Imam for the Shias, and the grandson of Muhammad, made a peace treaty with Muawiyah I. In the Hasan-Muawiya treaty, Hasan ibn Ali handed over power to Muawiya on the condition that he be just to the people and keep them safe and secure, and after his death he not establish a dynasty. This brought to an end the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs for the Sunnis, and Hasan ibn Ali was also the last Imam for the Shias to be a Caliph. Following this, Mu'awiyah broke the conditions of the agreement and began the Umayyad dynasty, with its capital in Damascus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Ali killed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">661 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who killed Ali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kharijite partisan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made peace with Muawiyah I?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hasan ibn Ali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the capital of the Umayyad dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Damascus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the time, the Umayyad taxation and administrative practice were perceived as unjust by some Muslims. The Christian and Jewish population had still autonomy; their judicial matters were dealt with in accordance with their own laws and by their own religious heads or their appointees, although they did pay a poll tax for policing to the central state. Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that abrahamic religious groups (still a majority in times of the Umayyad Caliphate), should be allowed to practice their own religion, provided that they paid the jizya taxation. The welfare state of both the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor started by Umar ibn al Khattab had also continued. Muawiya's wife Maysum (Yazid's mother) was also a Christian. The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were stable in this time. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting themselves in Syria, which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire. Prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious assimilation that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, as in Syria. This policy also boosted Muawiya's popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What form of tax were Christians required to pay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jizya </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the mother of Yazid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maysum </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Maysum's religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Umayyad Caliphate (Arabic: الخلافة الأموية‎, trans. Al-Khilāfat al-ʾumawiyya) was the second of the four major Islamic caliphates established after the death of Muhammad. This caliphate was centered on the Umayyad dynasty (Arabic: الأمويون‎, al-ʾUmawiyyūn, or بنو أمية, Banū ʾUmayya, &quot;Sons of Umayya&quot;), hailing from Mecca. The Umayyad family had first come to power under the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644–656), but the Umayyad regime was founded by Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, long-time governor of Syria, after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661 CE/41 AH. Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter, and Damascus was their capital. The Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests, incorporating the Caucasus, Transoxiana, Sindh, the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the Muslim world. At its greatest extent, the Umayyad Caliphate covered 15 million km2 (5.79 million square miles), making it the largest empire (in terms of area - not in terms of population) the world had yet seen, and the fifth largest ever to exist.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many major Islamic caliphates existed after Muhammad's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the third caliph?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uthman ibn Affan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Umayyad regime?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many million square miles was the Umayyad caliphate at its largest size?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5.79</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most historians[who?] consider Caliph Muawiyah (661–80) to have been the second ruler of the Umayyad dynasty, even though he was the first to assert the Umayyads' right to rule on a dynastic principle. It was really the caliphate of Uthman Ibn Affan (644–656), a member of Umayyad clan himself, that witnessed the revival and then the ascendancy of the Umayyad clan to the corridors of power. Uthman placed some of the trusted members of his clan at prominent and strong positions throughout the state. Most notable was the appointment of Marwan ibn al-Hakam, Uthman's first cousin, as his top advisor, which created a stir among the Hashimite companions of Muhammad, as Marwan along with his father Al-Hakam ibn Abi al-'As had been permanently exiled from Medina by Muhammad during his lifetime. Uthman also appointed as governor of Kufa his half-brother, Walid ibn Uqba, who was accused by Hashmites of leading prayer while under the influence of alcohol. Uthman also consolidated Muawiyah's governorship of Syria by granting him control over a larger area and appointed his foster brother Abdullah ibn Saad as the Governor of Egypt. However, since Uthman never named an heir, he cannot be considered the founder of a dynasty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Muawiyah become caliph?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">661</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the caliphate of Uthman Ibn Affan end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">656</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the son of Al-Hakam ibn Abi al-'As?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marwan ibn al-Hakam</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the death of Husayn, Ibn al-Zubayr, although remaining in Mecca, was associated with two opposition movements, one centered in Medina and the other around Kharijites in Basra and Arabia. Because Medina had been home to Muhammad and his family, including Husayn, word of his death and the imprisonment of his family led to a large opposition movement. In 683, Yazid dispatched an army to subdue both movements. The army suppressed the Medinese opposition at the Battle of al-Harrah. The Grand Mosque in Medina was severely damaged and widespread pillaging caused deep-seated dissent. Yazid's army continued on and laid siege to Mecca. At some point during the siege, the Kaaba was badly damaged in a fire. The destruction of the Kaaba and Grand Mosque became a major cause for censure of the Umayyads in later histories of the period.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What opposition movement was based in Arabia and Basra?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kharijites </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sent an army in 683 to stop the opposition movements?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yazid </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what battle was the Medinese opposition movement defeated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of al-Harrah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Kaaba located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mecca</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to tradition, the Umayyad family (also known as the Banu Abd-Shams) and Muhammad both descended from a common ancestor, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai, and they originally came from the city of Mecca. Muhammad descended from Abd Manāf via his son Hashim, while the Umayyads descended from Abd Manaf via a different son, Abd-Shams, whose son was Umayya. The two families are therefore considered to be different clans (those of Hashim and of Umayya, respectively) of the same tribe (that of the Quraish). However Muslim Shia historians suspect that Umayya was an adopted son of Abd Shams so he was not a blood relative of Abd Manaf ibn Qusai. Umayya was later discarded from the noble family. Sunni historians disagree with this and view Shia claims as nothing more than outright polemics due to their hostility to the Umayyad family in general. They point to the fact that the grand sons of Uthman, Zaid bin amr bin uthman bin affan and Abdullah bin Amr bin Uthman got married to the Sukaina and Fatima the daughters of Hussein son of Ali to show closeness of Banu hashem and Bani Ummayah.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for the Umayyads?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Banu Abd-Shams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Traditionally, who did the Umayyads and Muhammad both descend from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abd Manaf ibn Qusai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what city did the Umayyads originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mecca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What son of Abd-Shams was the ancestor of the Umayyads?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Umayya</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following this battle, Ali fought a battle against Muawiyah, known as the Battle of Siffin. The battle was stopped before either side had achieved victory, and the two parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute. After the battle Amr ibn al-As was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator, and Ali appointed Abu Musa Ashaari. Seven months later, in February 658, the two arbitrators met at Adhruh, about 10 miles north west of Maan in Jordon. Amr ibn al-As convinced Abu Musa Ashaari that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new Caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision which had lowered the Caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah I. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and Amr. Ali refused to accept the verdict and found himself technically in breach of his pledge to abide by the arbitration. This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters. The most vociferous opponents in Ali's camp were the very same people who had forced Ali into the ceasefire. They broke away from Ali's force, rallying under the slogan, &quot;arbitration belongs to God alone.&quot; This group came to be known as the Kharijites (&quot;those who leave&quot;). In 659 Ali's forces and the Kharijites met in the Battle of Nahrawan. Although Ali won the battle, the constant conflict had begun to affect his standing, and in the following years some Syrians seem to have acclaimed Muawiyah as a rival caliph.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Muawiyah fight Ali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Siffin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was appointed arbitrator by Ali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abu Musa Ashaari</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what battle did Ali fight the Kharjites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Nahrawan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the term Kharjites mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those who leave</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Quran and Muhammad talked about racial equality and justice as in The Farewell Sermon.

Following the Roman–Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian Sassanid Empire, and Syria, formally under the Byzantine Empire, also existed. Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their area. Previously, the second caliph Umar was very firm on the governors and his spies kept an eye on them.

The battle saw three top leaders of the Umayyad clan (Utba ibn Rabi'ah, Walid ibn Utbah and Shaybah) killed by Hashimites (Ali, Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith) in a three-on-three melee. This fueled the opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the grandson of Umayya, to Muhammad and to Islam. Abu Sufyan sought to exterminate the adherents of the new religion by waging another battle with Muslims based in Medina only a year after the Battle of Badr. He did this to avenge the defeat at Badr. The Battle of Uhud is generally believed by scholars to be the first defeat for the Muslims, as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans. After the battle, Abu Sufyan's wife Hind, who was also the daughter of Utba ibn Rabi'ah, is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Within five years after his defeat in the Battle of Uhud, however, Muhammad took control of Mecca and announced a general amnesty for all. Abu Sufyan and his wife Hind embraced Islam on the eve of the conquest of Mecca, as did their son (the future caliph Muawiyah I).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many top leaders of the Umayyads were killed in the Battle of Badr?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the son of Abu Sufyan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muawiyah I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Umayyads fight in the Battle of Badr?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hashimites </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do historians see as the first military defeat of Islam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Uhud</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the spouse of Abu Sufyan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hind</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Umar is honored for his attempt to resolve the fiscal problems attendant upon conversion to Islam.

These religious communities were not forced to convert to Islam, but were subject to a tax (jizyah) which was not imposed upon Muslims. This situation may actually have made widespread conversion to Islam undesirable from the point of view of state revenue, and there are reports that provincial governors actively discouraged such conversions. It is not clear how Umar attempted to resolve this situation, but the sources portray him as having insisted on like treatment of Arab and non-Arab (mawali) Muslims, and on the removal of obstacles to the conversion of non-Arabs to Islam.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What tax did non-Muslims pay in the Umayyad period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jizyah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was another term for Muslims who were not Arab?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mawali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Christians and Jews, what was a major non-Muslim religious group under the Umayyads?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zoroastrian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the assassination of Uthman in 656, Ali, a member of the Quraysh tribe and the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, was elected as the caliph.

Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn's death and his family's capture spread. They were then granted passage back to Medina. The sole adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn who was with fever too ill to fight when the caravan was attacked.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Ibn al-Zubayr flee to in 680?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mecca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Al-Husayn send to Kufa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim bin Agail</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Basrah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad murder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim bin Agail</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the year 712, Muhammad bin Qasim, an Umayyad general, sailed from the Persian Gulf into Sindh in Pakistan and conquered both the Sindh and the Punjab regions along the Indus river.

The troops of al-Mukhtar engaged in battles both with the Umayyads in 686, defeating them at the river Khazir near Mosul, and with Ibn al-Zubayr in 687, at which time the revolt of al-Mukhtar was crushed.

Once again, a particular difficulty concerned the question of the conversion of non-Arabs, especially the Sogdians of Transoxiana. Following the Umayyad defeat in the &quot;Day of Thirst&quot; in 724, Ashras ibn 'Abd Allah al-Sulami, governor of Khurasan, promised tax relief to those Sogdians who converted to Islam, but went back on his offer when it proved too popular and threatened to reduce tax revenues. Discontent among the Khurasani Arabs rose sharply after the losses suffered in the Battle of the Defile in 731, and in 734, al-Harith ibn Surayj led a revolt that received broad backing from Arabs and natives alike, capturing Balkh but failing to take Merv. After this defeat, al-Harith's movement seems to have been dissolved, but the problem of the rights of non-Arab Muslims would continue to plague the Umayyads.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main city of Tokharistan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Balkh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the central part of Transoxiana called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Samarkand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Day of Thirst occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">724</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of the revolt of 734?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">al-Harith ibn Surayj</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What notable battle occurred in 731?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of the Defile</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Hashimiyya movement (a sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia), led by the Abbasid family, overthrew the Umayyad caliphate.

In India the Arab armies were defeated by the south Indian Chalukya dynasty and by the north Indian Pratiharas Dynasty in the 8th century and the Arabs were driven out of India. In the Caucasus, the confrontation with the Khazars peaked under Hisham: the Arabs established Derbent as a major military base and launched several invasions of the northern Caucasus, but failed to subdue the nomadic Khazars. The conflict was arduous and bloody, and the Arab army even suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Marj Ardabil in 730.

The Umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle. On the pattern of the Byzantine system the Umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps: the centre, two wings, vanguards and rearguards, following the same formation while on march or on a battle field. Marwan II (740–50) abandoned the old division and introduced Kurdus (cohort), a small compact body. The Umayyad troops were divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Arab troops were dressed and armed in Greek fashion. The Umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles. The artillery used arradah (ballista), manjaniq (the mangonel) and dabbabah or kabsh (the battering ram). The heavy engines, siege machines and baggage were carried on camels behind the army.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the meaning of the term Kurdus in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cohort</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caliph reigned from 740 to 750?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marwan II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Umayyads call the mangonel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">manjaniq </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What style of dress did Arab troops wear under Marwan II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with artillery and infantry, what was the third division of Umayyad troops under Marwan II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cavalry </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mu'awiyah introduced postal service, Abd al-Malik extended it throughout his empire, and Walid made full use of it. The Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik developed a regular postal service. Umar bin Abdul-Aziz developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the Khurasan highway. Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and his agents and officials posted in the provinces. The main highways were divided into stages of 12 miles (19 km) each and each stage had horses, donkeys or camels ready to carry the post. Primarily the service met the needs of Government officials, but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefitted by the system. The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops. They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time. Under Governor Yusuf bin Umar, the postal department of Iraq cost 4,000,000 dirhams a year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first brought a postal service into Umayyad lands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mu'awiyah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along what highway did Umar bin Abdul-Aziz build caravanserais?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Khurasan </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In dirhams, what was the yearly cost of the Iraqi postal service when Yusuf bin Umar was governor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4,000,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with horses and camels, what animals were used by the postal service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">donkeys </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In kilometers, how far apart was each stage of the Umayyad highways?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However many early history books like the Islamic Conquest of Syria Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi state that after the conversion to Islam Muawiyah's father Abu Sufyan ibn Harb and his brothers Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan were appointed as commanders in the Muslim armies by Muhammad.

They were allowed to have their own courts, and were given freedom of their religion within the empire.[citation needed] Although they could not hold the highest public offices in the empire, they had many bureaucratic positions within the government.

The taxes to the central government were calculated and negotiated by the peoples political representatives.

In this respect it is notable that the Umayyad caliphs referred to themselves not as khalifat rasul Allah (&quot;successor of the messenger of God&quot;, the title preferred by the tradition), but rather as khalifat Allah (&quot;deputy of God&quot;). The distinction seems to indicate that the Umayyads &quot;regarded themselves as God's representatives at the head of the community and saw no need to share their religious power with, or delegate it to, the emergent class of religious scholars.&quot; In fact, it was precisely this class of scholars, based largely in Iraq, that was responsible for collecting and recording the traditions that form the primary source material for the history of the Umayyad period. In reconstructing this history, therefore, it is necessary to rely mainly on sources, such as the histories of Tabari and Baladhuri, that were written in the Abbasid court at Baghdad.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Arabic term did the Umayyad caliphs use to refer to themselves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">khalifat Allah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Abbasid court based?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baghdad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Arabic term for kingship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mulk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the tradition Arabic title used by caliphs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">khalifat rasul Allah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does khalifat Allah translate to in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deputy of God</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
