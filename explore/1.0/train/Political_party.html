Many political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent very different ideologies than they did when first founded. In democracies, political parties are elected by the electorate to run a government. Many countries have numerous powerful political parties, such as Germany and India and some nations have one-party systems, such as China. The United States is a two-party system, with its two most powerful parties being the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two most powerful political parties in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Democratic Party and the Republican Party</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name a nation that has a one-party political system.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">China</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are political parties elected in democracies? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the electorate </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some countries that have multiple powerful political parties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany and India</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first political factions, cohering around a basic, if fluid, set of principles emerged from the Exclusion Crisis and Glorious Revolution in late-17th-century England.

The leader of the Whigs was Robert Walpole, who maintained control of the government in the period 1721–1742; his protégé was Henry Pelham (1743–1754).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around what time did the first political factions start to emerge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late-17th-century England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the dominate political party for the first half of the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Whigs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader if the Whigs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Walpole</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the jacobite rising fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1715</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the century wore on, the factions slowly began to adopt more coherent political tendencies as the interests of their power bases began to diverge.

They acted as a united, though unavailing, opposition to Whig corruption and scandals. At times they cooperated with the &quot;Opposition Whigs&quot;, Whigs who were in opposition to the Whig government; however, the ideological gap between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party.

Out of this chaos, the first distinctive parties emerged. The first such party was the Rockingham Whigs under the leadership of Charles Watson-Wentworth and the intellectual guidance of the political philosopher Edmund Burke. Burke laid out a philosophy that described the basic framework of the political party as &quot;a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed&quot;. As opposed to the instability of the earlier factions, which were often tied to a particular leader and could disintegrate if removed from power, the party was centred around a set of core principles and remained out of power as a united opposition to government.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first distinctive Whig party that emerged from the chaos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Rockingham Whigs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of the Rockingham Whigs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Watson-Wentworth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the description for the basic framework of the Rockingham Whigs party?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did the Rockingham Whigs ever regain power as a opposition to the government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">remained out of power as a united opposition to government.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The modern Conservative Party was created out of the 'Pittite' Tories of the early 19th century. In the late 1820s disputes over political reform broke up this grouping. A government led by the Duke of Wellington collapsed amidst dire election results. Following this disaster Robert Peel set about assembling a new coalition of forces. Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism; – the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive, but an opposition to unnecessary change, that could lead to &quot;a perpetual vortex of agitation&quot;. Meanwhile, the Whigs, along with free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel, and independent Radicals, formed the Liberal Party under Lord Palmerston in 1859, and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle-class, under the long leadership of William Ewart Gladstone.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the modern Conservative party created from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the 'Pittite' Tories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who Issued the Tamworth manifesto?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Peel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party did the Whigs, along with others form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Liberal Party</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Tamworth manifesto introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1834 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although the Founding Fathers of the United States did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan, early political controversies in the 1790s over the extent of federal government powers saw the emergence of two proto-political parties- the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party, which were championed by Framers Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively.

The Home Rule League Party, campaigning for Home Rule for Ireland in the British Parliament was fundamentally changed by the great Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s. In 1882, he changed his party's name to the Irish Parliamentary Party and created a well-organized grass roots structure, introducing membership to replace &quot;ad hoc&quot; informal groupings. He created a new selection procedure to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats, and in 1884 he imposed a firm 'party pledge' which obliged MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and a formal party structure was unique at the time. His party's efficient structure and control contrasted with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the main British parties; – they soon came to model themselves on the Parnellite model.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of the Irish political party in the 1880s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Stewart Parnell </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Charles Stewart Parnell change his parties name to in 1882?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Irish Parliamentary Party</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did the Irish Parliamentary Party ever adopt the Parnellite model?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they soon came to model themselves on the Parnellite model.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A political party is typically led by a party leader (the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party), a party secretary (who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings), party treasurer (who is responsible for membership dues) and party chair (who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members, and also chairs party meetings). Most of the above positions are also members of the party executive, the leading organization which sets policy for the entire party at the national level. The structure is far more decentralized in the United States because of the separation of powers, federalism and the multiplicity of economic interests and religious sects. Even state parties are decentralized as county and other local committees are largely independent of state central committees. The national party leader in the U.S. will be the president, if the party holds that office, or a prominent member of Congress in opposition (although a big-state governor may aspire to that role). Officially, each party has a chairman for its national committee who is a prominent spokesman, organizer and fund-raiser, but without the status of prominent elected office holders.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do political parties have a Party leader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A political party is typically led by a party leader</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">party secretary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for the membership fees and expenses? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">party treasurer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for recruiting and maintaining party members?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">party chair</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When the party is represented by members in the lower house of parliament, the party leader simultaneously serves as the leader of the parliamentary group of that full party representation; depending on a minimum number of seats held, Westminster-based parties typically allow for leaders to form frontbench teams of senior fellow members of the parliamentary group to serve as critics of aspects of government policy.

Sometimes, typically in countries with less of an established democratic tradition, it is possible the dominant party will remain in power by using patronage and sometimes by voting fraud. In the latter case, the definition between dominant and one-party system becomes rather blurred. Examples of dominant party systems include the People's Action Party in Singapore, the African National Congress in South Africa, the Cambodian People's Party in Cambodia, the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, and the National Liberation Front in Algeria. One-party dominant system also existed in Mexico with the Institutional Revolutionary Party until the 1990s, in the southern United States with the Democratic Party from the late 19th century until the 1970s, in Indonesia with the Golkar from the early 1970s until 1998.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When are opposition parties allowed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In dominant-party systems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some of the reasons for a party's failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">political, social and economic circumstances, and public opinion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some ways a dominant party can stay in power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">patronage and sometimes by voting fraud</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some examples of dominant party systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African National Congress in South Africa, the Cambodian People's Party in Cambodia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how long did the dominant one-party system last in mexico?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968). As third party movements have learned, the Electoral College's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. Wallace had weak support outside the South. More generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the U.S.'s largely single-member district, winner-take-all elections. The tremendous land area and large population of the country are formidable challenges to political parties with a narrow appeal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of party system is the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two-party system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the first parties in the united States called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federalist and Republican</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how long did the Whigs survive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two decades</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are challenged to an unpopular political party?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tremendous land area and large population of the country</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party was anti-slavery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Democratic Party</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The UK political system, while technically a multi-party system, has functioned generally as a two-party (sometimes called a &quot;two-and-a-half party&quot;) system; since the 1920s the two largest political parties have been the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. Before the Labour Party rose in British politics the Liberal Party was the other major political party along with the Conservatives. Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics, the first-past-the-post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament. (A plurality voting system usually leads to a two-party system, a relationship described by Maurice Duverger and known as Duverger's Law.)

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious – discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which case are parties not likely to gain power on their own?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in cases where there are three or more parties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is Ireland ever not led by a coalition Government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Since what date has Ireland not been led by a single power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1989</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is political change easier?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Political change is often easier with a coalition government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are prime examples coalition governments that struggle to change policy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">post World War II France and Italy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Political parties, still called factions by some, especially those in the governmental apparatus, are lobbied vigorously by organizations, businesses and special interest groups such as trade unions.

Developing links between ideologically linked parties is another common feature of international support for a party. Sometimes this can be perceived as directly supporting the political aims of a political party, such as the support of the US government to the Georgian party behind the Rose Revolution. Other donors work on a more neutral basis, where multiple donors provide grants in countries accessible by all parties for various aims defined by the recipients.
