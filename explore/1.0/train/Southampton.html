Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage, with several container terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the Ocean Village development, which included a local marina and small entertainment complex, is a good example.

The centre was Phase Two of the West Quay development of the former Pirelli undersea cables factory; the first phase of this was the West Quay Retail Park, while the third phase (Watermark Westquay) was put on hold due to the recession. Work is has resumed in 2015, with plans for this third stage including shops, housing, an hotel and a public piazza alongside the Town Walls on Western Esplanade. Southampton has also been granted a licence for a large casino. A further part of the redevelopment of the West Quay site resulted in a new store, opened on 12 February 2009, for Swedish home products retailer IKEA. Marlands is a smaller shopping centre, built in the 1990s and located close to the northern side of WestQuay. Southampton currently has two disused shopping centres: the 1970s Eaststreet mall, and the 1980s Bargate centre. Neither of these were ever commercially successful; the former has been earmarked for redevelopment as a Morrison's supermarket, while the future of the latter is uncertain. There is also the East Street area which has been designated for speciality shopping, with the aim of promoting smaller retailers, alongside the chain store Debenhams.

Data from the Southampton Safer City Partnership shows there has been a reduction in all crimes in recent years and an increase in crime detection rates. According to government figures Southampton has a higher crime rate than the national average. There is some controversy regarding comparative crime statisitics due to inconsistencies between different police forces recording methodologies. For example, in Hampshire all reported incidents are recorded and all records then retained. However, in neighbouring Dorset crimes reports withdrawn or shown to be false are not recorded, reducing apparent crime figures.

Reception areas for new cars now fill the Eastern Docks where passengers, dry docks and trains used to be.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade was the ferry port built in Southampton to carry people to exotic destinations on the continent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year did car ferries finish operating from Southampton, other than the one to the Isle of Wight?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was built on the site where the Southampton Ferry Port used to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a retail and housing development</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has the Princess Alexandra Dock become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a marina</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What location that was once filled with passengers, dry docks, and trains is now a holding area for new cars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eastern Docks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Buses now provide the majority of local public transport. The main bus operators are First Southampton and Bluestar. Other operators include Brijan Tours, Stagecoach and Xelabus. The other large service provider is the Uni-link bus service (running from early in the morning to midnight), which was commissioned by the University of Southampton to provide transport from the university to the town. Previously run by Enterprise, it is now run by Bluestar. Free buses are provided by City-link'. The City-link runs from the Red Funnel ferry terminal at Town Quay to Central station via WestQuay and is operated by Bluestar. There is also a door-to-door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride, for residents who cannot access public transport. This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What form of public transport do most people in Southampton use now?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with First Southampton, what is the other main bus operator in Southampton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bluestar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bus service did the University of Southampton commission to carry people between the city and the university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uni-link</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What time does Uni-link stop service to the university each night?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">midnight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What operator ran Uni-link before Bluestar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Enterprise</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are two main termini for bus services. As the biggest operator, First uses stops around Pound Tree Road. This leaves the other terminal of West Quay available for other operators. Uni-link passes West Quay in both directions, and Wilts &amp; Dorset drop passengers off and pick them up there, terminating at a series of bus stands along the road. Certain Bluestar services also do this, while others stop at Bargate and some loop round West Quay, stopping at Hanover Buildings. There was a tram system from 1879 to 1949.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What road does First use stops around to leave a terminal available for other buses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pound Tree Road</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which bus service passes West Quay going in both directions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uni-link</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What operator drops off and picks up passengers at West Quay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wilts &amp; Dorset</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the tram system stop operating in Southampton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do buses that loop around West Quay stop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hanover Buildings</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
