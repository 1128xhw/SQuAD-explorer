Bribery requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to their role in private financial gain, bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive).[citation needed] In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do you call paying government officials to use their position in their office?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a bribe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the minimum amount of people that can be involved in a bribe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when corruption is part of all public life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">culture of corruption</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyond getting money, bribes are also used to cause what to others?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">harm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In recent years,[when?] the international community has made efforts to encourage countries to dissociate active and passive bribery and to incriminate them as separate offences.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two types of bribery is the international community trying to get prosecuted as separate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">active and passive bribery</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable.[citation needed] Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a &quot;fee&quot; to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174): For the purpose of this Convention, &quot;corruption&quot; means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In some countries there is no formal deal but what that makes prosecuting bribes difficult?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mutual understanding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A bribe can include requesting, offering, giving or what of favors or money?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">accepting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bribes can be direct or what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indirect</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Trading in influence, or influence peddling, refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution).

These countries score high on the Ease of Doing Business Index, due to good and often simple regulations, and have rule of law firmly established.
