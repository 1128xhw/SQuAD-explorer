Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year. Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member acting on his own, he cracked down on the organization, put President Muhammad Naguib under house arrest, and assumed executive office, officially becoming president in June 1956.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What number president of Egypt was Nasser?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization attempted to assassinate Nasser?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim Brotherhood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Nasser become president?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1956</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Nasser die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of government did Nasser overthrow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monarchy </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal and his emergence as the political victor from the subsequent Suez Crisis substantially elevated his popularity in Egypt and the Arab world. Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria (1958–1961). In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries and he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died. His funeral in Cairo drew five million mourners and an outpouring of grief across the Arab world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many mourners attended Nasser's funeral?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What landmark water route did Nasser nationalize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Suez Canal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization did Nasser create with Syria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Arab Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What civil war did Nasser become entangled in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Yemen Civil War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Nasser start his second term as President?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nasser remains an iconic figure in the Arab world, particularly for his strides towards social justice and Arab unity, modernization policies, and anti-imperialist efforts.

Nasser's detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his government's human rights violations, his populist relationship with the citizenry, and his failure to establish civil institutions, blaming his legacy for future dictatorial governance in Egypt.

His parents married in 1917, and later had two more boys, Izz al-Arab and al-Leithi. Nasser's biographers Robert Stephens and Said Aburish wrote that Nasser's family believed strongly in the &quot;Arab notion of glory&quot;, since the name of Nasser's brother, Izz al-Arab, translates to &quot;Glory of the Arabs&quot;—a rare name in Egypt.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Nasser's father's occupation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">postal worker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city was Nasser raised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexandria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Nasser born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1918 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Nasser's brother's name translate to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Glory of the Arabs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What siblings did Nasser have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two more boys</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1928, Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city's Attarin elementary school. He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan, and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father, who was working for the city's postal service. It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism. After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose. The protest, organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society, called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi. Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What elementary school did Nasser attend?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Attarin </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Nasser go to boarding school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Helwan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What secondary school did Nasser attend?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ras el-Tin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did young Nasser witness demonstrations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manshia Square</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization organized the protests Nasser witnessed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Young Egypt Society</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When his father was transferred to Cairo in 1933, Nasser joined him and attended al-Nahda al-Masria school.

On 13 November 1935, Nasser led a student demonstration against British rule, protesting against a statement made four days prior by UK foreign minister Samuel Hoare that rejected prospects for the 1923 Constitution's restoration. Two protesters were killed and Nasser received a graze to the head from a policeman's bullet. The incident garnered his first mention in the press: the nationalist newspaper Al Gihad reported that Nasser led the protest and was among the wounded.

Khairy Pasha agreed and sponsored Nasser's second application, which was accepted in late 1937. Nasser focused on his military career from then on, and had little contact with his family. At the academy, he met Abdel Hakim Amer and Anwar Sadat, both of whom became important aides during his presidency. After graduating from the academy in July 1938, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry, and posted to Mankabad. It was here that Nasser and his closest comrades, including Sadat and Amer, first discussed their dissatisfaction at widespread corruption in the country and their desire to topple the monarchy.

In 1942, the British Ambassador Miles Lampson marched into King Farouk's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha for having pro-Axis sympathies. Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote, &quot;I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack&quot;, and wished for &quot;calamity&quot; to overtake the British. Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year. He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution.

They asked former prime minister Ali Maher to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an all-civilian cabinet. The Free Officers then governed as the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vice-chairman. Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser's schemes—agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties—as too radical, culminating in Maher's resignation on 7 September. Naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister, and Nasser that of deputy prime minister. In September, the Agrarian Reform Law was put into effect.

On 28 February 1955, Israeli troops attacked the Egyptian-held Gaza Strip with the stated aim of suppressing Palestinian fedayeen raids. Nasser did not feel that the Egyptian Army was ready for a confrontation and did not retaliate militarily. His failure to respond to Israeli military action demonstrated the ineffectiveness of his armed forces and constituted a blow to his growing popularity. Nasser subsequently ordered the tightening of the blockade on Israeli shipping through the Straits of Tiran and restricted the use of airspace over the Gulf of Aqaba by Israeli aircraft in early September. The Israelis re-militarized the al-Auja Demilitarized Zone on the Egyptian border on 21 September.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did Nasser make secret agreements with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Israel </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What territory did Israel attack in 1955?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gaza Strip</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Nasser's reaction to the attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">did not retaliate militarily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Egyptian people feel about Nasser's response to the attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a blow to his growing popularity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Nasser eventually do in the Straights of Titan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blockade on Israeli shipping</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Simultaneous with Israel's February raid, the Baghdad Pact was formed between some regional allies of the UK.

Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt's regional leadership position he needed to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military. When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a US$320,000,000 armaments agreement with Czechoslovakia on 27 September. Through the Czechoslovakian arms deal, the balance of power between Egypt and Israel was more or less equalized and Nasser's role as the Arab leader defying the West was enhanced.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agreement ran contrary to Nasser's efforts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baghdad Pact</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Nasser feel his military needed to oppose the West?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modern weaponry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what country did Nasser buy arms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Czechoslovakia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did Nasser spend on weapons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$320,000,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the military relationship between Egypt and Israel change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">equalized </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nasser mediated discussions between the pro-Western, pro-Soviet, and neutralist conference factions over the composition of the &quot;Final Communique&quot; addressing colonialism in Africa and Asia and the fostering of global peace amid the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union.

A failed counter-coup by a Nasserist colonel followed, after which Nasser condemned the Ba'athists as &quot;fascists&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What groups completed a coup in Iraq?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ba'athist–Nasserist alliance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became the new Iraqi president after the coup?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abdel Salam Aref</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the agreement to fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Syria's Ba'athists purged Nasser's supporters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Nasser describe the Ba'athists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fascists</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In January 1964, Nasser called for an Arab League summit in Cairo to establish a unified Arab response against Israel's plans to divert the Jordan River's waters for economic purposes, which Syria and Jordan deemed an act of war.

He discouraged Syria and Palestinian guerrillas from provoking the Israelis, conceding that he had no plans for war with Israel. During the summit, Nasser developed cordial relations with King Hussein, and ties were mended with the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Morocco. In May, Nasser moved to formally share his leadership position over the Palestine issue by initiating the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In practice, Nasser used the PLO to wield control over the Palestinian fedayeen.

His supporters claimed Nasser's move was meant to buy time to prepare for another confrontation with Israel, while his detractors believed his acceptance of the resolution signaled a waning interest in Palestinian independence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Arab League summit held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Khartoum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What leader assumed a more prominent position due to Nasser's difficulites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Faisal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agreement ended the Yemeni civil war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Khartoum Resolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nation granted military aid to Egypt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet Union </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What document called for Israel to abandon land it obtained during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UN Resolution 242</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nasser appointed himself the additional roles of prime minister and supreme commander of the armed forces on 19 June 1967.

In this case Nasser's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces&quot; and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. &quot;All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes...

He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did other Arab leaders have to do to gain admiration of their populations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seek good relations with Egypt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Nasser cause in the wider Arab world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several nationalist revolutions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have other Arab leaders been unable to do that Nasser was?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">communicated directly with the public masses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Nasser symbolize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the popular Arab will</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To varying degrees, Nasser's statist system of government was continued in Egypt and emulated by virtually all Arab republics, namely Algeria, Syria, Iraq, Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya. Ahmed Ben Bella, Algeria's first president, was a staunch Nasserist. Abdullah al-Sallal drove out the king of North Yemen in the name of Nasser's pan-Arabism. Other coups influenced by Nasser included those that occurred in Iraq in July 1958 and Syria in 1963. Muammar Gaddafi, who overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969, considered Nasser his hero and sought to succeed him as &quot;leader of the Arabs&quot;. Also in 1969, Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, a supporter of Nasser, took power in Sudan. The Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM) helped spread Nasser's pan-Arabist ideas throughout the Arab world, particularly among the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese, and in South Yemen, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq. While many regional heads of state tried to emulate Nasser, Podeh opined that the &quot;parochialism&quot; of successive Arab leaders &quot;transformed imitation [of Nasser] into parody&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Algeria's first president, a fervent Nasserist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ben Bella</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Nasserist usurped the King of Yemen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abdullah al-Sallal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which leader considered Nasser his hero?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muammar Gaddafi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What leader took power in Sudan and was inspired by Nasser?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization continued Nasser's philosophies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arab Nationalist Movement</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1963, Egyptian director Youssef Chahine produced the film El Nasser Salah El Dine (&quot;Saladin The Victorious&quot;), which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin, considered a hero in the Arab world, and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies. Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 Nasser 56. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser, the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 1963 film compared Nasser to Saladin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">El Nasser Salah El Dine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 1996 Nasser-related film set a box office record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nasser 56</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Nasser 56 about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Suez Crisis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the famous biopic about Nasser?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gamal Abdel Nasser</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem, the 22-year-old daughter of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom died when she was young.

After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they would live for the rest of their lives.
