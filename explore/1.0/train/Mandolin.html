It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did the mandolin originate from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does mandolin translate to? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small mandola</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What musical family does the mandolin come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> lute family</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the mandolin usually played?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">usually plucked with a plectrum or &quot;pick&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many courses does a mandolin commonly have? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are many styles of mandolin, but four are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music. Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music. Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish, British and Brazilian folk music. Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the four common styles of mandolins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the round-back mandolin made of? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> strips of wood, glued together into a bowl</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which style of mandolin has a shallower, arched back, and arched top?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">round-back</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which form of music do Neapolitan mandolins feature? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> European classical music and traditional music.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which mandolin is commin in American Folk music and blue grass music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carved-top instruments</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard (the top). Pre-mandolin instruments were quiet instruments, strung with as many as six courses of gut strings, and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill. However, modern instruments are louder—using four courses of metal strings, which exert more pressure than the gut strings. The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure of metal strings that would break earlier instruments. The soundboard comes in many shapes—but generally round or teardrop-shaped, sometimes with scrolls or other projections. There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard, either round, oval, or shaped like a calligraphic F (f-hole). A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did most of the development of the mandolin revolve around?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soundboard (the top)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were premandolins quiet or loud instruments? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> quiet instruments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are modern mandolins' strings made of? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four courses of metal strings,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common soundboard shape?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">generally round or teardrop-shaped</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the sound holes covered with? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain (Andalusia) by the Moors, another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily, where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians. There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims, and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo’s royal Cappella Palatina, dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140. His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (1194 - 1250) continued integrating Muslims into his court, including Moorish musicians. By the 14th century, lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and, probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor, based in Palermo, the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who introduced the lute to Spain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Moors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country helped transfer the lute from Arabian to European culture? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sicily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who brought the lute to Sicily?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What court held singer-lutenists after the Norman conquest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palermo </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What building has ceeiling painting dedicated to the lutenists? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palermo’s royal Cappella Palatina,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop.

The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years, in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians, and in the concert hall. After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815, however, its popularity began to fall. The 19th century produced some prominent players, including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati. However, professional virtuosity was in decline, and the mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument; &quot;the large repertoire of notated instrumental music for the mandolino and the mandoline was completely forgotten&quot;. The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815, and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874, the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was &quot;out of date.&quot; Salvador Léonardi mentioned this decline in his 1921 book, Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo, saying that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the beginning of the transition from mandolino to mandolin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1744 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the mandolin grow in popularity? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians, and in the concert hall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the mandolin's popularity begin to fall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815, however, its popularity began to fall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were two of the promiment players in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the export market for manodlins from Italy dry up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1815</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878, the instrument's popularity rebounded.

Along with the energy and awareness created by the day's hit sensation, a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s, playing and teaching their instrument. The instrument's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in &quot;early years of the 20th century.&quot; Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime, and it became an instrument of society, taken up by young men and women.

This is especially true of violin music, since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin. Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent. The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras, so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities. Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan. Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine, Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a &quot;fad&quot; instrument in the early 20th century. This &quot;mandolin craze&quot; was fading by the 1930s, but just as this practice was falling into disuse, the mandolin found a new niche in American country, old-time music, bluegrass and folk music. More recently, the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music, with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital, Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instrument does the mandolin share the same tuning of?  </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">violin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the mandolin primarily used? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the mandolin considered a fad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early 20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who contributed to the idea that the mandolin was a fad? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Giuseppe Pettine, Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the mandolin craze end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1930s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Phil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia, and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community.

Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents. The instrument has also found its way into British rock music. The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose &quot;Fog on the Tyne&quot; was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do, and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire. McGuinness Flint, for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single, When I'm Dead And Gone, is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and played mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse. It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit &quot;Dance Tonight.&quot; That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name. The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people. Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin. This song was left off their debut album, and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is a famous British player?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Simon Mayor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Simon mayer produce? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who played the mandolin on the album Tubular Bells? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mike Oldfield</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was UK's biggest selling album? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Fog on the Tyne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song by Rod Stewart used the mandolin? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maggie May </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The mandolin's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro, or in the United States, simply the &quot;Spanish Students.&quot; The group landed in the U.S. on January 2, 1880 in New York City, and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds. Ironically, this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias, which are also small, double-strung instruments that resemble the mandolin. The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes. An Italian musician, Carlo Curti, hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the &quot;Original Spanish Students,&quot; counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins. The imitators' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group in the US was popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Estudiantina Figaro</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Estudiantina Figaro come to the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> January 2, 1880</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Estudiantina Figaro play? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boston and New York</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group was inspired by the Estudiantina Figaro? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Original Spanish Students</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Origianl Spanish Students expect the American  public not to know? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed in the 1880s, as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s. According to Clarence L. Partee, the first mandolin made in the United States was made in 1883 or 1884 by Joseph Bohmann, who was an established maker of violins in Chicago. Partee characterized the early instrument as being larger than the European instruments he was used to, with a &quot;peculiar shape&quot; and &quot;crude construction,&quot; and said that the quality improved, until American instruments were &quot;superior&quot; to imported instruments.

Often, these teacher-dealers conducted mandolin orchestras: groups of 4-50 musicians who played various mandolin family instruments. However, alongside the teacher-dealers were serious musicians, working to create a spot for the instrument in classical music, ragtime and jazz. Like the teacher-dealers, they traveled the U.S., recording records, giving performances and teaching individuals and mandolin orchestras. Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville and became one of America's preeminent mandolinists. Seth Weeks was an African American who not only taught and performed in the United States, but also in Europe, where he recorded records. Another pioneering African American musician and director who made his start with a mandolin orchestra was composer James Reese Europe. W. Eugene Page toured the country with a group, and was well known for his mandolin and mandola performances. Other names include Valentine Abt, Samuel Adelstein, William Place, Jr., and Aubrey Stauffer.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What popular musical casted a teacher-dealer? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Music Man</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did these teacher-dealers often conduct? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mandolin orchestras</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people were usually in these teacher-dealer orchestras? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4-50 musicians </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who played the mandolin in Vaudeville? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Samuel Siegel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the famous African American musican and director? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">composer James Reese Europe.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s, and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s, the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass. The famous Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson (1923) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles, with little success. However, The &quot;Loar&quot; became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S/N 73987 in a Florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The setting the mandolin was used in until the 1930's was? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ensemble setting </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the mandolins find a new home? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bluegrass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mandolin was designed to boost interest in the mandolin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mandolin became the face of bluegrass music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Loar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instrument did artist Bill Monroe use? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">F-5 S/N 73987 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The mandolin orchestras never completely went away, however. In fact, along with all the other musical forms the mandolin is involved with, the mandolin ensemble (groups usually arranged like the string section of a modern symphony orchestra, with first mandolins, second mandolins, mandolas, mandocellos, mando-basses, and guitars, and sometimes supplemented by other instruments) continues to grow in popularity. Since the mid-nineties, several public-school mandolin-based guitar programs have blossomed around the country, including Fretworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra, the first of its kind. The national organization, Classical Mandolin Society of America, founded by Norman Levine, represents these groups. Prominent modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in the classical music tradition include Samuel Firstman, Howard Fry, Rudy Cipolla, Dave Apollon, Neil Gladd, Evan Marshall, Marilynn Mair and Mark Davis (the Mair-Davis Duo), Brian Israel, David Evans, Emanuil Shynkman, Radim Zenkl, David Del Tredici and Ernst Krenek.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What groups have become popular amonbgpublic schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mandolin-based guitar programs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two of the popular public school groups? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">retworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who found the Classical Mandolin Society of America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Norman Levine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are modern mandolinists and composers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Samuel Firstman, Howard Fry, Rudy Cipolla</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926, his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin. By the 1930s, single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music, most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys (Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers (Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe). However, the mandolin's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man: Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass music. After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939, Bill Monroe formed his own group, after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys, and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a &quot;parlor&quot; sound typical of brother duets to the modern &quot;bluegrass&quot; style. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South, directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin. Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin, signed and dated July 9, 1923, by Lloyd Loar, chief acoustic engineer at Gibson. The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What family recorded an old-time music in 1924-1926?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Cowan Powers and his family </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the earliest known southern music artist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Orpha Powers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of mandolin was becoming popular by 1930's? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ingle mandolins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was considered the father of Bluegrass music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bill Monroe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Bill Monroe's group called? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blue Grass Boys</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Monroe's style involved playing lead melodies in the style of a fiddler, and also a percussive chording sound referred to as &quot;the chop&quot; for the sound made by the quickly struck and muted strings. He also perfected a sparse, percussive blues style, especially up the neck in keys that had not been used much in country music, notably B and E. He emphasized a powerful, syncopated right hand at the expense of left-hand virtuosity. Monroe's most influential follower of the second generation is Frank Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long, who often tour as a duet.

Some well-known players include Marty Stuart, Vince Gill, and Ricky Skaggs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Jethro Burns commonly known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of music did Jethro Burns play? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jazz mandolinist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who popularized the mandolin in Western Swing Music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tiny Moore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was well known for important works of traditional blugrass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chris Thile of California i</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are othe rwell know players? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Marty Stuart, Vince Gill, and Ricky Skaggs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mandolin has also been used in blues music, most notably by Ry Cooder, who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings, Yank Rachell, Johnny &quot;Man&quot; Young, Carl Martin, and Gerry Hundt. Howard Armstrong, who is famous for blues violin, got his start with his father's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with, with band makeup including &quot;mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos. And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle.&quot; Other blues players from the era's string bands include Willie Black (Whistler And His Jug Band), Dink Brister, Jim Hill, Charles Johnson, Coley Jones (Dallas String Band), Bobby Leecan (Need More Band), Alfred Martin, Charlie McCoy (1909-1950), Al Miller, Matthew Prater, and Herb Quinn.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who got his start with his father's mandolin? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Howard Armstrong,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the most popular blue music mandolinist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ry Cooder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other instrument did the Tennessee string bands use? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ukulele in there and a bass fiddle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who played in the Whistler and His Jug Band? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Willie Black</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The mandolin has been used occasionally in rock music, first appearing in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s. Levon Helm of The Band occasionally moved from his drum kit to play mandolin, most notably on Rag Mama Rag, Rockin' Chair, and Evangeline. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull played mandolin on Fat Man, from their second album, Stand Up, and also occasionally on later releases. Rod Stewart's 1971 No. 1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff. David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album, Friend of the Devil and Ripple, which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings. John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page both played mandolin on Led Zeppelin songs. The popular alt rock group Imagine Dragons feature the mandolin on a few of their songs, most prominently being It's Time. Dash Crofts of the soft rock duo Seals and Crofts extensively used mandolin in their repertoire during the 1970s. Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980, which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin. The song didn't chart in the United States but was popular in much of Europe and the Philippines.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the mandolin first appear in rock music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">psychedelic era of the late 1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who played the drums and the mandolin in the group called The Band?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Levon Helm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Rod Stewart song in 1971 featured the mandolin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maggie May</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artist from the Greatful Dead played the mandolin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Grisman </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tommy Shaw sang and played the mandolin in which Styx song?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boat on the River</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song &quot;Locust Street.&quot; Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song &quot;Dream of the Archer&quot; from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song &quot;The Battle of Evermore.&quot; &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot; by Maria McKee, the theme song to the film Days of Thunder, prominently features a mandolin.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of mandolin do rock musicians today use? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">single-stringed electric </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Irish-American punk band uses Mandolins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dropkick Murphys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What REM song uses simple mandolin licks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Losing My Religion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What American rock band has extensive use of mandolins? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">System of A Down</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What film's theme song uses a mandolin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Days of Thunder</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As in Brazil, the mandolin has played an important role in the Music of Venezuela. It has enjoyed a privileged position as the main melodic instrument in several different regions of the country. Specifically, the eastern states of Sucre, Nueva Esparta, Anzoategui and Monagas have made the mandolin the main instrument in their versions of Joropo as well as Puntos, Jotas, Polos, Fulias, Merengues and Malagueñas. Also, in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes: Bambucos, Pasillos, Pasodobles, and Waltzes. In the western city of Maracaibo the Mandolin has been played in Decimas, Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas; in the capital, Caracas, the Merengue Rucaneao, Pasodobles and Waltzes have also been played with mandolin for almost a century. Today, Venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama, Jesus Rengel, Ricardo Sandoval, Saul Vera, and Cristobal Soto.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What place in Brazil do mandolins play an important role?  </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Venezuela</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the sound of mandolin associated with in the west country? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">egional genres of the Venezuelan Andes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are the famous Venezuelen mandolinist? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alberto Valderrama, Jesus Rengel, Ricardo Sandoval, Saul Vera, and Cristobal Soto.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To fill this gap in the literature, mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles. Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works. Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany, but also exist throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments, or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces. The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of: first and second mandolins, mandolas (either octave mandolas, tuned an octave below the mandolin, or tenor mandolas, tuned like the viola), mandocellos (tuned like the cello), and bass instruments (conventional string bass or, rarely, mandobasses). Smaller ensembles, such as quartets composed of two mandolins, mandola, and mandocello, may also be found.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of music has mandolins played? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do traditional mandolin orchestras remain popular? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan and Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the structure of a contempory traditional orchestra consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> first and second mandolins,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are smalled ensambles composed of? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two mandolins, mandola, and mandocello,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the mandocellos usually tuned like? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cello</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
