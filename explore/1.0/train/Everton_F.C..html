Howard Kendall had returned in 1990 but could not repeat his previous success, while his successor, Mike Walker, was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player Joe Royle took over in 1994 the club's form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 2–0 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation, leading the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history, defeating Manchester United 1–0 in the final.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Everton admitted as a member of the Premier League?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Howard Kendall return to manage Everton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced Howard Kendall as Everton's manager?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mike Walker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the score in the first Everton game managed by Joe Royle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2–0</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did former Everton player Joe Royle take over managing the club?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1994</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Tower has been inextricably linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787.

At this time, a dispute of how the club was to be owned and run emerged with Anfield's owner and Everton's chairman, John Houlding. A dispute between Houlding and the club's committee over how the club should be run, led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, &quot;Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd&quot;. In response, Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club have played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association.
