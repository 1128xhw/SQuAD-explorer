When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she was considered as umm walad or &quot;mother of a child&quot;, a status that granted her privileged rights.

The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European descent (with some Malay ancestry, especially in the Western Cape).

This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas. Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies: The traders shipped more female slaves than males, as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards. The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high. The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners' families under the patrilineal kinship system. As a result, few distinctive Afro-Arab black communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many sub-Saharan Black Africans were enslaved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 to 18 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what time frame were these people enslaved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between the advent of Islam in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who enslaved these people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arab slave traders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were women slaves more popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> for them to serve as concubines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was assimilated into the Arab slave owner families?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genetic studies have found significant African female-mediated gene flow in Arab communities in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries, with an average of 38% of maternal lineages in Yemen are of direct African descent, 16% in Oman-Qatar, and 10% in Saudi Arabia-United Arab Emirates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people in Yemen have African lineage? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">average of 38% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people in Oman-Qatar have African lineage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people in Saudi Arabia-United Arab Emirates have African lineage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Genetic studies have found which gene in Arab communities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African female-mediated gene </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq, with a reported 1.2 million black people, and they attest to a history of discrimination.

Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive. This term was accepted as normal, including by people classified as Negroes, until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. of his own race as &quot;Negro&quot; in his famous speech of 1963, I Have a Dream. During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably Malcolm X, objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens, or worse.

Individuals identified themselves, for example, as Ashanti, Igbo, Bakongo, or Wolof. However, when the first captives were brought to the Americas, they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique. A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group.[citation needed] By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did black people identify in early America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> by their specific ethnic group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was not acknowledged by English colonists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individual ethnic affiliations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How vast was the backgrounds of the captives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the new African American identity defined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> This new identity was based on provenance and slave status</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> French and Spanish colonists </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The US racial or ethnic classification &quot;black&quot; refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including albinos, if they are believed by others to have West African ancestry (in any discernible percentage), or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being &quot;African American&quot;.

They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of &quot;African&quot; from their institutions and replace it with &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Colored American&quot;. A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church. African Americans popularly used the terms &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;colored&quot; for themselves until the late 1960s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the use of &quot;African&quot; become an issue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the majority of black people in the United States were native-born</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did blacks fear to identify as African?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Black leaders call for this change in language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1835,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group decided to keep the &quot;African&quot; in their name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the African Methodist Episcopal Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What terms did African Americans use instead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;colored&quot; </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1988, the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term &quot;African American&quot; because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate. Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin.[citation needed] Others have argued that &quot;black&quot; is a better term because &quot;African&quot; suggests foreignness, although Black Americans helped found the United States. Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones. Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;Black&quot;, although they have a slight preference for &quot;black&quot; in personal settings and &quot;African American&quot; in more formal settings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who argued for Americans to use the term &quot;African American&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jesse Jackson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Jesse Jackson make this argument?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Jackson want this term to be used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who also argued for the term &quot;African American&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African-American</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did some argue that &quot;black&quot; was the better term?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> because &quot;African&quot; suggests foreignness</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The U.S. census race definitions says a &quot;black&quot; is a person having origins in any of the black (sub-Saharan) racial groups of Africa.

As in other Latin countries, intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of mixed race (pardo) often tended to marry white, and their descendants became accepted as white.

Other social factors, such as illiteracy and education levels, show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color.

New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What race has a very low rate of holding public office in Brazil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> blacks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the population of Salvador, Bahia is black or mixed race?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 80%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the US institute the Voting Rights Act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did New Orleans elect it's first black Mayor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What large hurricane hit New Orleans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hurricane Katrina</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Critics note that people of color have limited media visibility.

This proposal has been criticized since the term pardo is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people, such as caboclos (mestizos), assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials, not only people of partial African and European descent. Trying to identify this entire group as &quot;black&quot; would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other, equally valid, ancestries and cultures.
