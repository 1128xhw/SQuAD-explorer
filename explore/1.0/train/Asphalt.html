The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world's reserves of natural bitumen, in three huge deposits covering 142,000 square kilometres (55,000 sq mi), an area larger than England or New York state. These bituminous sands contain 166 billion barrels (26.4×10^9 m3) of commercially established oil reserves, giving Canada the third largest oil reserves in the world. and produce over 2.3 million barrels per day (370×10^3 m3/d) of heavy crude oil and synthetic crude oil. Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads, nearly all of the bitumen is now used as raw material for oil refineries in Canada and the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for asphalt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bitumen </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides occurrences in Canada, where in the US is asphalt found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Utah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the planet's asphalt is located in Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the area amount of the Canadian asphalt deposits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">142,000 square kilometres</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does most of Canada's asphalt end up these days?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oil refineries </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples.

All three used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water.

Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.[not in citation given]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what early technology was bitumen used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">photographic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What photographer used bitumen to make the earliest extant nature picture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joseph Nicéphore Niépce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What feature of bitumen use in photography made it impractical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hours of exposure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what period was bitumen used in printing processes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1850s to the 1920s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Exposure to what natural element was necessary for early photographic plates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> light</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first British patent for the use of asphalt/bitumen was 'Cassell's patent asphalte or bitumen' in 1834.

The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 barrels (50 m3) per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who experimented with bitumen extraction techniques to make shipping easier?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sidney Ells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What researcher patented a hot water oil process to separate bitumen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dr. Karl A.

Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What property of bitumen makes it difficult to move through pipelines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">extremely viscous</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What industry is capable of refining bitumen directly into gasoline without preprocessing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modern oil refineries </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do refineries like to buy bitumen instead of synthetic oil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cost is lower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much Canadian bitumen was exported to the US by 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 65% </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures.

There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does mixing bitumen with water create?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emulsion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of bitumen is found in bitumen/water emulsions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two types of bitumen emulsions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cationic and anionic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some bitumen emulsions blended with to make a low-cost product?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">recycled </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of asphalt pavements an cold-mix asphalt resemble?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> hot-mixed</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Naturally occurring crude asphalt/bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from &quot;Oil sands&quot;, currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world. The Athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods. Because of oil price increases after 2003, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m3) per day and was projected to rise to 4.4 million barrels (700,000 m3) per day by 2020. The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 billion barrels (50×10^9 m3), which at a rate of 4,400,000 barrels per day (700,000 m3/d) would last about 200 years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is naturally occurring bitumen in rock being developed as a feed stock for petroleum production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alberta, Canada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much area does Canada's natural bitumen cover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">140,000 square kilometres</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Canada rank in world's oil supplies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second-largest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Canada's only surface bitumen mine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Athabasca oil sands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the amount of bitumen that can be extracted in Alberta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">310 billion barrels</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt/bitumen consumption.

The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac, which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands, both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar.

An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by &quot;a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel&quot;, and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – &quot;principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth&quot;, which at that time made the water unusable. &quot;He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces&quot; in palaces, &quot;the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation&quot;. But it was generally neglected in France until the revolution of 1830. Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used &quot;for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes&quot;. Its rise in Europe was &quot;a sudden phenomenon&quot;, after natural deposits were found &quot;in France at Osbann (BasRhin), the Parc (l'Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (Puy-de-Dome)&quot;, although it could also be made artificially. One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the Place de la Concorde in 1835.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who described the use of bitumen and pitch to tar ships?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pierre Belon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Belon make his shipbuilding observations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1553</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did a French magazine describe the use of asphalt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1838</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After what event in France did  asphalt begin to be used for pavements and assorted other uses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">revolution of 1830</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in France in 1835 was asphalt used to lay pavement? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Place de la Concorde </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1838, Claridge obtained patents in Scotland on 27 March, and Ireland on 23 April, and in 1851 extensions were sought for all three patents, by the trustees of a company previously formed by Claridge.

Due to pressure from the rising of the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming the oil sands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what is the organic matter in asphalt similar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> meteorites</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Alberta bitumen mines begin as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">living material </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of living materials formed the basis of bitumen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plants and animals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What feature originally covered Alberta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ocean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What temperatures did the organic deposits need to form bitumen over the eons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50 to 150 °C</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional bitumen to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot bitumen in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry.

When bitumen is mixed with clay it is usually called asphaltum. The earlier word 'asphaltum' is now archaic and not commonly used.[citation needed] In American English, 'asphalt' is equivalent to the British 'bitumen'. However, 'asphalt' is also commonly used as a shortened form of 'asphalt concrete' (therefore equivalent to the British 'asphalt' or 'tarmac'). In Australian English, bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces. In Canadian English, the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil, while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture roof shingles and various waterproofing products. Diluted bitumen (diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines) is known as dilbit in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen &quot;upgraded&quot; to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit. Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen. The tar sands of Alberta, Canada are a similar material.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what type of aggregate did asphalt used to refer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mixture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the mixture of bitumen and minerals called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tarmac </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When mixed wit clay, what is bitumen called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">asphaltum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what word in America, is bitumen used interchangeably?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">'asphalt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the geological term for asphalt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bitumen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What pigment did 19th century artists use that was deemed unfavorably?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bitumen </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did bitumen when used as a paint not do correctly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">solidifies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did even limited use of bitumen do to damage paintings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deterioration </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artist's work i considered to be an example of the damaging effects of bitumen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Théodore Géricault's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What major problem did bitumen as a pigment show itself to be?  </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unstable </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1914, Claridge's Company entered into a joint venture to produce tar-bound macadam, with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called Clarmac Roads Ltd.

Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt/bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt/bitumen and the aggregates, but warm-mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is synthetic crude oil usually called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">syncrude</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the mined bitumen taken for refining?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">upgrading facility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invented the process for removing bitumen from sands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dr. Karl Clark</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Un what decade did Clark develop the hot water removal process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1920s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many barrels of crude were upgraders making per day by 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1 million barrels </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>About 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984[needs update].

Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as naphtha, gasoline and diesel). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a de-asphalting unit, the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by &quot;blowing&quot; the product: namely reacting it with oxygen.
