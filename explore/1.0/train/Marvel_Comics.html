The issue was a great success, with it and a second printing the following month selling, combined, nearly 900,000 copies. While its contents came from an outside packager, Funnies, Inc., Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist Joe Simon, teamed with artist and emerging industry notable Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes, Captain America, in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million. Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the cover date on Marvel Comics #1?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oct. 1939</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Marvel/Timely's first true full-time editor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Joe Simon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides Simon, who co-created Captain America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jack Kirby</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the character created by Carl Burgos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Human Torch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what issue was Namor, The Sub-Mariner introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marvel Comics #1</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these &quot;big three&quot;, some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer, Miss America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel.

Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954, with the Human Torch (art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers, variously), the Sub-Mariner (drawn and most stories written by Bill Everett), and Captain America (writer Stan Lee, artist John Romita Sr.).

Modern Marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961), broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated. This applied to The Amazing Spider-Man title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel's most successful book.

Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror (The Tomb of Dracula), martial arts, (Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu), sword-and-sorcery (Conan the Barbarian, Red Sonja), satire (Howard the Duck) and science fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey, &quot;Killraven&quot; in Amazing Adventures, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and, late in the decade, the long-running Star Wars series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint. Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages.
