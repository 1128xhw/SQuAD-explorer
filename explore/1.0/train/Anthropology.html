Its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology, which describes the workings of societies around the world, linguistic anthropology, which investigates the influence of language in social life, and biological or physical anthropology, which concerns long-term development of the human organism. Archaeology, which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as history.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is anthropology a study of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> humans and their societies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of anthropology describes the workings of societies around the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What investigates the influence of language in social life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">linguistic anthropology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subdivision of anthropology concerns itself with the long-term development of the human organism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> physica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Archaeology considered a branch of anthropology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Similar organizations in other countries followed: The American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently.

Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Bronislaw Malinoswki and Franz Boas do their relevant work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 19th and early 20th centuries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Margaret Mead advocate for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> gender equality and sexual liberation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has cultural anthropology distinguished itself from other social sciences by emphasizing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> cross-cultural comparisons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Boas' argue against?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th-century racial ideology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has cultural anthropology specifically emphasized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Anthropology is a global discipline where humanities, social, and natural sciences are forced to confront one another.

Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison. This project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic monograph. As methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology. Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures.

To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities.

The first of these areas was concerned with the &quot;pre-capitalist&quot; societies that were subject to evolutionary &quot;tribal&quot; stereotypes. Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the 'original affluent society' did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.

Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more &quot;complex&quot; social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on &quot;Negara&quot;, the Balinese state is an early, famous example.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of anthropology is interested in the structure of political systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Political </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what basis do political anthropologists examine the structure of political systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">structure of societies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the new development of a stateless society come about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The presence of states, bureaucracies and markets makes for what type of social setting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;complex&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did a comparative work on a Balinese state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geertz</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting in 1993.

By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do anthropologists typically like to divide up the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relevant time periods and geographic regions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How has human time on Earth been divided up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cultural traditions based on material</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Olduwan, Mousterian, and Levalloisian are all types of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tool </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mapping cultures is central to both the sciences of anthropologists and who else?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">geographers </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a central part of the science of anthropology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comparative method</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).
