Some historians contend that the conflict in Asia can be dated back to 7 July 1937 with the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China, or possibly 19 September 1931, beginning with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. However, it is more widely accepted that the Pacific War itself started in early December 1941, with the Sino-Japanese War then becoming part of it as a theater of the greater World War II.[nb 9]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do most people believe the Pacific War began?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early December 1941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Japan attack Pearl Harbor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7/8 December 1941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Second Sino-Japanese War begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7 July 1937</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries did the Second Sino-Japanese War encompass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Empire of Japan and the Republic of China</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Has Japan ever attacked Thailand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Japan invaded Thailand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the generally accepted date the Pacific War started?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 7/8 December 1941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Japan invade Manchuria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19 September 1931</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nation initiated hostilities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Japan invade China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7 July 1937 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Pacific War theater part of after December 1941?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War II</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Pacific War saw the Allied powers pitted against the Empire of Japan, the latter briefly aided by Thailand and to a much lesser extent by its Axis allies, Germany and Italy.

The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.

In August 1937, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to fight about 300,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai, but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937 and committed which was known as Nanking Massacre. In March 1938, Nationalist forces won their first victory at Taierzhuang. but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade Wuhan and captured it in October.

After these victories, Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity, it was repulsed by Japanese army in late March 1940. In August of 1940, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted the &quot;Three Alls Policy&quot; (&quot;Kill all, Burn all, Loot all&quot;) in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists. By 1941 the conflict had become a stalemate. Although Japan had occupied much of northern, central, and coastal China, the Nationalist Government had retreated to the interior with a provisional capital set up at Chungking while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi. In addition, Japanese control of northern and central China was somewhat tenuous, in that Japan was usually able to control railroads and the major cities (&quot;points and lines&quot;), but did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside. The Japanese found its aggression against the retreating and regrouping Chinese army was stalled by the mountainous terrain in southwestern China while the Communists organised widespread guerrilla and saboteur activities in northern and eastern China behind the Japanese front line.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Chinese ultimately fail in its counter offensives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> low military-industrial capacity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What policy did Japan adopt to retaliate against China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Three Alls Policy&quot; (&quot;Kill all, Burn all, Loot all&quot;)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What slowed the Japanese in their attacks on China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mountainous terrain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city did Japan set up a provisional capital?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chungking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Japan's &quot;Three Alls Policy&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Kill all, Burn all, Loot all&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did China and Japan reach a stalemate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Chinese provisional capital?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chungking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What natural obsticles stalled the Japanese offensive against the Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mountainous terrain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group organised guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Communists</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Japan sponsored several puppet governments, one of which was headed by Wang Jingwei.

At the time of the attack, the U.S. was not officially at war anywhere in the world, which means that the people killed or property destroyed at Pearl Harbor by the Japanese attack had a non-combatant status.[nb 11] The Japanese had gambled that the United States, when faced with such a sudden and massive blow, would agree to a negotiated settlement and allow Japan free rein in Asia. This gamble did not pay off. American losses were less serious than initially thought: The American aircraft carriers, which would prove to be more important than battleships, were at sea, and vital naval infrastructure (fuel oil tanks, shipyard facilities, and a power station), submarine base, and signals intelligence units were unscathed.

Most of the Nationalist guerrilla areas were eventually overtaken by the Communists. On the other hand, some Nationalist units were deployed to blockade the Communists and not the Japanese. Furthermore, many of the forces of the Chinese Nationalists were warlords allied to Chiang Kai-Shek, but not directly under his command. &quot;Of the 1,200,000 troops under Chiang's control, only 650,000 were directly controlled by his generals, and another 550,000 controlled by warlords who claimed loyalty to his government; the strongest force was the Szechuan army of 320,000 men.

A council was established in London, with a subsidiary body in Washington. However, the smaller powers continued to push for an American-based body. The Pacific War Council was formed in Washington, on 1 April 1942, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, his key advisor Harry Hopkins, and representatives from Britain, China, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Canada. Representatives from India and the Philippines were later added. The council never had any direct operational control, and any decisions it made were referred to the U.S.-UK Combined Chiefs of Staff, which was also in Washington. Allied resistance, at first symbolic, gradually began to stiffen.

Moreover, Combined Fleet doctrine was inadequate to execute the proposed &quot;barrier&quot; defence. Instead, Japan decided on additional attacks in both the south and central Pacific. While she had the element of surprise at Pearl Harbor, Allied codebreakers had now turned the tables. They discovered an attack was planned against Port Moresby; if it fell, Japan would control the seas to the north and west of Australia and could isolate the country. The carrier USS Lexington under Admiral Fletcher joined USS Yorktown and an American-Australian task force to stop the Japanese advance. The resulting Battle of the Coral Sea, fought in May 1942, was the first naval battle in which ships involved never sighted each other and only aircraft were used to attack opposing forces. Although Lexington was sunk and Yorktown seriously damaged, the Japanese lost the carrier Shōhō, and suffered extensive damage to Shōkaku and heavy losses to the air wing of Zuikaku, both of which missed the operation against Midway the following month. Although Allied losses were heavier than Japanese, the attack on Port Moresby was thwarted and the Japanese invasion force turned back, a strategic victory for the Allies. The Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia. Moreover, Japan lacked the capacity to replace losses in ships, planes and trained pilots.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What American carrier joined the USS Yorktown to stop the Japanese attack on Port Moresby in 1942?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">USS Lexington</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What admiral was the USS Lexington under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Admiral Fletcher</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Battle of the Coral Sea fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 1942</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Japanese carrier was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shōhō</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What American carrier was sunk in the Battle of the Coral Sea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lexington</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A Japanese force was sent north to attack the Aleutian Islands.

Planned surveillance of the U.S. fleet by long range seaplane did not happen (as a result of an abortive identical operation in March), so Fletcher's carriers were able to proceed to a flanking position without being detected.

Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, Nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, the American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as the crews worked hastily to properly re-arm their air groups.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Japanese fleet arrive off Midway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4 June</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many TBD Devastator torpedo bombers were lauched from the Hornet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did Nagumo change orders for arming his aircraft?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twice </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many carriers did Nagumo have at the Battle of Midway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were on the decks of the Japanese aircraft carriers when the American dive bobers attacked?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">munitions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the Japanese CAP out of position and the carriers at their most vulnerable, SBD Dauntlesses from Enterprise and Yorktown appeared at an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m) and commenced their attack, quickly dealing fatal blows to three fleet carriers: Sōryū, Kaga, and Akagi. Within minutes, all three were ablaze and had to be abandoned with great loss of life. Hiryū managed to survive the wave of dive bombers and launched a counter-attack against the American carriers which caused severe damage to Yorktown (which was later finished off by a Japanese submarine). However, a second attack from the U.S. carriers a few hours later found and destroyed Hiryū, the last remaining fleet carrier available to Nagumo. With his carriers lost and the Americans withdrawn out of range of his powerful battleships, Yamamoto was forced to call off the operation, leaving Midway in American hands. The battle proved to be a decisive victory for the Allies. For the second time, Japanese expansion had been checked and its formidable Combined Fleet was significantly weakened by the loss of four fleet carriers and many highly trained, virtually irreplaceable, personnel. Japan would be largely on the defensive for the rest of the war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what altitude did the American dive bombers commence their attck on the Japanese carriers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10,000 feet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Japanese carrier survived the first wave of American dive bombers in the Battle of Midway.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hiryū</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who won the Battle of Midway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Allies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many fleet carriers were lost by the Japanese in the Battle of Midway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Japanese land forces continued to advance in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea.

Most of the Japanese aircraft based in the South Pacific were redeployed to the defense of Guadalcanal. Many were lost in numerous engagements with the Allied air forces based at Henderson Field as well as carrier based aircraft. Meanwhile, Japanese ground forces launched repeated attacks on heavily defended US positions around Henderson Field, in which they suffered appalling casualties. To sustain these offensives, resupply was carried out by Japanese convoys, termed the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; by the Allies. The convoys often faced night battles with enemy naval forces in which they expended destroyers that the IJN could ill-afford to lose. Later fleet battles involving heavier ships and even daytime carrier battles resulted in a stretch of water near Guadalcanal becoming known as &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot; from the multitude of ships sunk on both sides. However, the Allies were much better able to replace these losses. Finally recognizing that the campaign to recapture Henderson Field and secure Guadalcanal had simply become too costly to continue, the Japanese evacuated the island and withdrew in February 1943.

In January 1942, Chinese forces got a victory at Changsha which was the first Allied success against Japan.
After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi of China, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of searching out the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases. This operation started on 15 May 1942 with 40 infantry battalions and 15–16 artillery battalions but was repelled by Chinese forces in September. During this campaign, The Imperial Japanese Army left behind a trail of devastation and had also spread cholera, typhoid, plague and dysentery pathogens. Chinese estimates put the death toll at 250,000 civilians. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their own biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.
On 2 November 1943, Isamu Yokoyama, commander of the Imperial Japanese 11th Army, deployed the 39th, 58th, 13th, 3rd, 116th and 68th divisions, a grand total of around 100,000 troops, to attack Changde of China. During the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition. Although the Japanese army initially successfully captured the city, the Chinese 57th division was able to pin them down long enough for reinforcements to arrive and encircle the Japanese. The Chinese army then cut off the Japanese supply lines, forcing them into retreat, whereupon the Chinese pursued their enemy. During the battle, in an act of desperation, Japan used chemical weapons.
In the aftermath of the Japanese conquest of Burma, there was widespread disorder in eastern India, and a disastrous famine in Bengal, which ultimately caused up to 3 million deaths. In spite of these, and inadequate lines of communication, British and Indian forces attempted limited counter-attacks in Burma in early 1943. An offensive in Arakan failed, while a long distance raid mounted by the Chindits under Brigadier Orde Wingate suffered heavy losses, but was publicized to bolster Allied morale. It also provoked the Japanese to mount major offensives themselves the following year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the 40th, 3rd, and 6th divisions massed at in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yueyang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the first river that the 40th, 3rd, and 6th Japanese divisions crossed while advancing southward?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xinqiang River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Chinese civilians were estimated to have died during the Japanese Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">250,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the river that the 40th, 3rd, and 6th Japanese divisions tried crossing to reach Changsha?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miluo River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commanded the Imperial Japanese 11th Army on November, 1943?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Isamu Yokoyama</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In August 1943 the Allies formed a new South East Asia Command (SEAC) to take over strategic responsibilities for Burma and India from the British India Command, under Wavell.

The Dutch force were in fact the first to sink an enemy warship; On 24 December 1941, HNLMS K XVI torpedoed and sank the Japanese destroyer Sagiri.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What doctrine did Roosevelt give for submarines against Japan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> unrestricted submarine warfare </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Dutch Admiral in charge of the East Indies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Conrad Helfrich</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nickname given to the Dutch Admiral in charge of the East Indies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Ship-a-day Helfrich&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first Japanese warship to be sunk by submarine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sagiri</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first Japanese warship sunk by a submarine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24 December 1941</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While Japan had a large number of submarines, they did not make a significant impact on the war. In 1942, the Japanese fleet subs performed well, knocking out or damaging many Allied warships. However, Imperial Japanese Navy (and pre-war U.S.) doctrine stipulated that only fleet battles, not guerre de course (commerce raiding) could win naval campaigns. So, while the US had an unusually long supply line between its west coast and frontline areas, leaving it vulnerable to submarine attack, Japan used its submarines primarily for long-range reconnaissance and only occasionally attacked U.S. supply lines. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia in 1942 and 1943 also achieved little.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What doctrine stated that only fleet battles could win naval campaigns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Imperial Japanese Navy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was commerce raiding refered to as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">guerre de course </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the primary use of Japanese submarines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> long-range reconnaissance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Japanese submarine offensive against Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1942 and 1943</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Japanese submarine offensive against Austrailia achieve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">little</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The U.S. Navy, by contrast, relied on commerce raiding from the outset.

As well, basing in Australia placed boats under Japanese aerial threat while en route to patrol areas, reducing their effectiveness, and Nimitz relied on submarines for close surveillance of enemy bases. Furthermore, the standard-issue Mark 14 torpedo and its Mark VI exploder both proved defective, problems which were not corrected until September 1943. Worst of all, before the war, an uninformed US Customs officer had seized a copy of the Japanese merchant marine code (called the &quot;maru code&quot; in the USN), not knowing that the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had broken it. The Japanese promptly changed it, and the new code was not broken again by OP-20G until 1943.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the US Navy rely on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">commerce raiding </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What led to guerrilla submarine missions in early 1942?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Allied forces surrounded in the Philippines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Admiral Nimitze rely on submarines for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">close surveillance of enemy bases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the defective torpedo problems of the US Navy corrected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 1943</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the &quot;maru code&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Japanese merchant marine code</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Thus, only in 1944 did the U.S. Navy begin to use its 150 submarines to maximum effect: installing effective shipboard radar, replacing commanders deemed lacking in aggression, and fixing the faults in the torpedoes. Japanese commerce protection was &quot;shiftless beyond description,&quot;[nb 14] and convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to Allied ones, a product of flawed IJN doctrine and training – errors concealed by American faults as much as Japanese overconfidence. The number of U.S. submarines patrols (and sinkings) rose steeply: 350 patrols (180 ships sunk) in 1942, 350 (335) in 1943, and 520 (603) in 1944. By 1945, sinkings of Japanese vessels had decreased because so few targets dared to venture out on the high seas. In all, Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships – about five million tons of shipping. Most were small cargo-carriers, but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the East Indies. Another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports. At critical stages of the Guadalcanal, Saipan, and Leyte campaigns, thousands of Japanese troops were killed or diverted from where they were needed. Over 200 warships were sunk, ranging from many auxiliaries and destroyers to one battleship and no fewer than eight carriers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the US Navy begin to use it's submarines to maximum effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1944</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Japanese ships were sunk in 1942 by United States submarines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">180 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Japanese merchant ships did Allied submarines sink during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,200</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Japanese carriers were sunk during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Japanese ships were sunk in 1944 by United States submarines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">603</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In mid-1944 Japan mobilized over 500,000 men  and launched a massive operation across China under the code name Operation Ichi-Go, their largest offensive of World War II, with the goal of connecting Japanese-controlled territory in China and French Indochina and capturing airbases in southeastern China where American bombers were based. During this time, many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under Joseph Stilwell set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement. Though Japan suffered about 100,000 casualties, these attacks, the biggest in several years, gained much ground for Japan before Chinese forces stopped the incursions in Guangxi. Despite major tactical victories, the operation overall failed to provide Japan with any significant strategic gains. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions such as Battle of West Hunan. Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. Operation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the code name for the mid-1944 offensive across China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Operation Ichi-Go</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Chinese stop the Operation Ichi-Go incursion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guangxi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the largest Japanese offensive in World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Operation Ichi-Go</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was able to take advantage of the social confusion created by Operation Ichi-Go?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese Communist guerrillas </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many casualties did the Japanese suffer during Operation Ichi-Go?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 100,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the Allied setbacks in 1943, the South East Asia command prepared to launch offensives into Burma on several fronts.

The only way to do this was to destroy the U.S. Fifth Fleet, which had 15 fleet carriers and 956 planes, 7 battleships, 28 submarines, and 69 destroyers, as well as several light and heavy cruisers. Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa attacked with nine-tenths of Japan's fighting fleet, which included nine carriers with 473 planes, 5 battleships, several cruisers, and 28 destroyers. Ozawa's pilots were outnumbered 2:1 and their aircraft were becoming or were already obsolete. The Japanese had considerable antiaircraft defenses but lacked proximity fuzes or good radar. With the odds against him, Ozawa devised an appropriate strategy. His planes had greater range because they were not weighed down with protective armor; they could attack at about 480 km (300 mi)[citation needed], and could search a radius of 900 km[citation needed] (560 mi). U.S. Navy Hellcat fighters could only attack within 200 miles (320 km) and only search within a 325-mile (523 km)[citation needed] radius. Ozawa planned to use this advantage by positioning his fleet 300 miles (480 km)[citation needed] out. The Japanese planes would hit the U.S. carriers, land at Guam to refuel, then hit the enemy again when returning to their carriers. Ozawa also counted on about 500 land-based planes at Guam and other islands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was it imperative for the Japanese to hold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saipan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many fleet carriers did the U.S. Fifth Fleet have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many fleet planes did the U.S. Fifth Fleet have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">956</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the search radius of U.S. Navy Hellcat fighters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">325-mile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many carriers did Ozawa have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The forces converged in the largest sea battle of World War II up to that point.

This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte.

Because they were observing radio silence, Nishimura was unable to synchronize with Shima and Kurita. Nishimura and Shima had failed to even coordinate their plans before the attacks – they were long-time rivals and neither wished to have anything to do with the other. When he entered the narrow Surigao Strait at about 02:00, Shima was 22 miles (40 km) behind him, and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea, several hours from the beaches at Leyte. As they passed Panaon Island, Nishimura's force ran into a trap set for them by the U.S.-Australian 7th Fleet Support Force. R. Adm. Jesse Oldendorf had six battleships, four heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, 29 destroyers and 39 PT boats. To pass the strait and reach the landings, Nishimura had to run the gauntlet. At about 03:00 the Japanese battleship Fusō and three destroyers were hit by torpedoes and Fusō broke in two. At 03:50 the U.S. battleships opened fire. Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese. The battleship Yamashiro, a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch (406 mm) shells; Yamashiro sank at 04:19. Only one of Nishimura's force of seven ships survived the engagement. At 04:25 Shima's force of two cruisers and eight destroyers reached the battle. Seeing Fusō and believing her to be the wrecks of two battleships, Shima ordered a retreat, ending the last battleship-vs-battleship action in history.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many battleships were in Nishimura's force?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Japanese admiral was a  rival of Nishimura?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shima</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles was Shima's fleet behind Nishimura?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who set the trap for the Japanese forces as they sailed by Panaon Island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">R.

The U.S. Third Fleet was formidable – nine large carriers, eight light carriers, six battleships, 17 cruisers, 63 destroyers and 1,000 planes – and completely outgunned Ozawa's force. Halsey's ships set out in pursuit of Ozawa just after midnight. U.S. commanders ignored reports that Kurita had turned back towards San Bernardino Strait. They had taken the bait set by Ozawa. On the morning of 25 October Ozawa launched 75 planes. Most were shot down by U.S. fighter patrols. By 08:00 U.S. fighters had destroyed the screen of Japanese fighters and were hitting ships.

The only thing standing in his path were three groups (Taffy 1, 2 and 3) of the Seventh Fleet, commanded by Admiral Thomas Kinkaid. Each group had six escort carriers, with a total of more than 500 planes, and seven or eight destroyers or destroyer escorts (DE). Kinkaid still believed that Lee's force was guarding the north, so the Japanese had the element of surprise when they attacked Taffy 3 at 06:45. Kurita mistook the Taffy carriers for large fleet carriers and thought he had the whole Third Fleet in his sights. Since escort carriers stood little chance against a battleship, Adm. Clifton Sprague directed the carriers of Taffy 3 to turn and flee eastward, hoping that bad visibility would reduce the accuracy of Japanese gunfire, and used his destroyers to divert the Japanese battleships. The destroyers made harassing torpedo attacks against the Japanese. For ten minutes Yamato was caught up in evasive action. Two U.S. destroyers and a DE were sunk, but they had bought enough time for the Taffy groups to launch planes. Taffy 3 turned and fled south, with shells scoring hits on some of its carriers and sinking one of them. The superior speed of the Japanese force allowed it to draw closer and fire on the other two Taffy groups. However, at 09:20 Kurita suddenly turned and retreated north. Signals had disabused him of the notion that he was attacking the Third Fleet, and the longer Kurita continued to engage, the greater the risk of major air strikes. Destroyer attacks had broken the Japanese formations, shattering tactical control. Three of Kurita's heavy cruisers had been sunk and another was too damaged to continue the fight. The Japanese retreated through the San Bernardino Strait, under continuous air attack. The Battle of Leyte Gulf was over; and a large part of the Japanese surface fleet destroyed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Kurita pass through the San Bernardino Strait?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">03:00 on 25 October</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Kurit head after passing through the San Bernardino Strait?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">along the coast of Samar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Admiral Kincaid commanded what three groups of the Seventh Fleet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taffy 1, 2 and 3</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What broke the Japanes formations under Kurita?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Destroyer attacks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of Kurita's heavy cruisers were sunk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Three</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The battle secured the beachheads of the U.S. Sixth Army on Leyte against attack from the sea, broke the back of Japanese naval power and opened the way for an advance to the Ryukyu Islands in 1945.

Both nations were exhausted by years of battles, bombings and blockades. After Japanese victories in Operation Ichi-Go, Japan were losing the battle in Burma and facing constant attacks from Chinese Nationalists forces and Communist guerrillas in the country side. The Japanese army began preparations for the Battle of West Hunan in March 1945. Japanese mobilized 34th, 47th, 64th, 68th and 116th Divisions, as well as the 86th Independent Brigade, for a total of 80,000 men to seize Chinese airfields and secure railroads in West Hunan by early April. In response, the Chinese National Military Council dispatched the 4th Front Army and the 10th and 27th Army Groups with He Yingqin as commander-in-chief. At the same time, it airlifted the entire Chinese New 6th Corps, an American-equipped corps and veterans of the Burma Expeditionary Force, from Kunming to Zhijiang. Chinese forces totaled 110,000 men in 20 divisions. They were supported by about 400 aircraft from Chinese and American air forces. Chinese forces achieved a decisive victory and launched a large counterattack in this campaign. Concurrently, the Chinese managed to repel a Japanese offensive in Henan and Hubei. Afterwards, Chinese forces retook Hunan and Hubei provinces in South China. Chinese launched a counter offensive to retake Guangxi which was the last major Japanese stronghold in South China. In August 1945, Chinese forces successfully retook Guangxi.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1945, how many years had Japan already been at war with China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What battle did the Japanese Army begin to prepare for in March 1945?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of West Hunan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Japanese soldiers were mobilized to capture the Chinese airfields and railroads in West Hunan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Chinese commander-in-chief of the 10th and 27th Army Groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">He Yingqin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chinese forces retake Guangxi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 1945</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The largest and bloodiest American battle came at Okinawa, as the U.S. sought airbases for 3,000 B-29 bombers and 240 squadrons of B-17 bombers for the intense bombardment of Japan's home islands in preparation for a full-scale invasion in late 1945. The Japanese, with 115,000 troops augmented by thousands of civilians on the heavily populated island, did not resist on the beaches—their strategy was to maximize the number of soldier and Marine casualties, and naval losses from Kamikaze attacks. After an intense bombardment the Americans landed on 1 April 1945 and declared victory on 21 June. The supporting naval forces were the targets for 4,000 sorties, many by Kamikaze suicide planes. U.S. losses totaled 38 ships of all types sunk and 368 damaged with 4,900 sailors killed. The Americans suffered 75,000 casualties on the ground; 94% of the Japanese soldiers died along with many civilians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many B-29 bombers were airbases need for in Okinawa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many squadrons of B=17 bombers were airbases need for in Okinawa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">240</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Japanese troops were on Okinawa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">115,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the United States land forces on Okinawa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1 April 1945</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many U.S. ships were lost at Okinawa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">38</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hard-fought battles on the Japanese home islands of Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and others resulted in horrific casualties on both sides but finally produced a Japanese defeat.

Japanese industrial production plunged as nearly half of the built-up areas of 67 cities were destroyed by B-29 firebombing raids. On 9–10 March 1945 alone, about 100,000 people were killed in a conflagration caused by an incendiary attack on Tokyo. LeMay also oversaw Operation Starvation, in which the inland waterways of Japan were extensively mined by air, which disrupted the small amount of remaining Japanese coastal sea traffic. On 26 July 1945, the President of the United States Harry S. Truman, the President of the Nationalist Government of China Chiang Kai-shek and the Prime Minister of Great Britain Winston Churchill issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference.

In a press release issued after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Truman warned Japan to surrender or &quot;...expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.&quot; Three days later, on 9 August, the U.S. dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the last nuclear attack in history. More than 140,000–240,000 people died as a direct result of these two bombings. The necessity of the atomic bombings has long been debated, with detractors claiming that a naval blockade and aerial bombing campaign had already made invasion, hence the atomic bomb, unnecessary. However, other scholars have argued that the bombings shocked the Japanese government into surrender, with Emperor finally indicating his wish to stop the war. Another argument in favor of the atomic bombs is that they helped avoid Operation Downfall, or a prolonged blockade and bombing campaign, any of which would have exacted much higher casualties among Japanese civilians. Historian Richard B. Frank wrote that a Soviet invasion of Japan was never likely because they had insufficient naval capability to mount an amphibious invasion of Hokkaidō.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">America dropped what on August 6, 1945?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> atomic bomb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the forst Japenese city nuked by the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hiroshima</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the blockade and bombing of Japan planed to make them surrender?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Operation Downfall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did American drop a nuclear bomb on Nagasaki?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9 August</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote that a Soviet invasion of Japan was unlikely?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard B.
