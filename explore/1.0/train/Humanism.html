The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it. Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress. In modern times, humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be seen as of essential importance to a practiced of humanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">human beings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a common tenant of humanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">freedom and progress</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What can be credited for the changes in the definition of humanism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> intellectual movements</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">These days humanism could be viewed as a form of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">secularism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of turning to a spiritual or divine source practicers of humanism turn to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> science</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call &quot;humane&quot; or &quot;polite&quot; learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves &quot;humanists&quot;. Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was humanism once considered the same as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philanthropy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who has disagreed with this connotation of the word?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gellius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which period did Gellius gain fame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Italian Renaissanc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is credited with clarifying and making the term humanitas commonplace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cicero</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the characteristic that most separates humans from animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">speech</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the French Revolution, and soon after, in Germany (by the Left Hegelians), humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the transcendent or supernatural.

It is similar to Protestantism, although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural. In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century Enlightenment, have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with classical learning and the liberal arts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> At the time of the French Revolution what previous focus of humanism was removed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">supernatural</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Protestantism differs from Humanism in its focus is on what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> supernatural</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do current tenants humanism have their origins in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th-century Enlightenment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a name for humanism believers who emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Religious Humanism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term Humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools, and by 1836 the word &quot;humanism&quot; had been absorbed into the English language in this sense.

In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of &quot;The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing&quot;. The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots &quot;philanthropic&quot; and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word &quot;humanism&quot; by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the &quot;mere humanity&quot; (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that &quot;property is theft&quot;) used the word &quot;humanism&quot; to describe a &quot;culte, déification de l’humanité&quot; (&quot;worship, deification of humanity&quot;) and Ernest Renan in L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848 (&quot;The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848&quot;) (1848–49), states: &quot;It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity—all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which period was the philosophy of humanism next updated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French Enlightenment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the criticism of Humanism made by conservatives of the time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">idolatry of humanity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who continued to support the belief system despite its critics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">liberal reformers and radicals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who felt that humanism would surely be a major &quot;religion&quot; today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ernest Renan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At about the same time, the word &quot;humanism&quot; as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the so-called Left Hegelians, Arnold Ruge, and Karl Marx, who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms: philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main difference between humanism and the religions of the time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">centred on humankind</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What well known socialist adopted the usage of this term in Germany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karl Marx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did benevolent believers in humanism turn to for ideas about the philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek philosophers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the learned believers place their focus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">linguistic and cultural disciplines</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra, composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran.

The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices, made freely in this present life, in the afterlife. The importance placed on thought, action, responsibility, and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by, and inspired a number of, Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ancient text provides an example of the humanist way of thinking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gathas of Zarathustra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was this writing penned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,000 BCE – 600 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was this writing penned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">afterlife</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What well know scholar was inspired by Humanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Voltaire</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In China, Yellow Emperor is regarded as the humanistic primogenitor.[citation needed] Sage kings such as Yao and Shun are humanistic figures as recorded.[citation needed] King Wu of Zhou has the famous saying: &quot;Humanity is the Ling (efficacious essence) of the world (among all).&quot; Among them Duke of Zhou, respected as a founder of Rujia (Confucianism), is especially prominent and pioneering in humanistic thought.

Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. Pericles, the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include Protagoras (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot; and Democritus, who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally Plato and Aristotle. The historian Thucydides, noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists. In the 3rd century BCE, Epicurus became known for his concise phrasing of the problem of evil, lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving eudaimonia. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was one of the first Greeks to adopt a humanistic outlook?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thales of Miletus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did this type of thinking next travel to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Athens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first introduced the idea that matter is made of atoms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Democritus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person to provide education opportunities to females?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Epicurus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later Middle Ages and the Early Modern period.

Paul Johnson agrees that Petrarch was &quot;the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness&quot;. According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors.

With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought. One humanist, the Greek Orthodox Platonist Gemistus Pletho (1355–1452), based in Mystras, Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan polytheism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What is one religious text that was thought to eventually lead to a peace between all?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Jewish Kabbalah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave followers of Humanism the ability to think out of bounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Renaissance Church authorities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave followers of Humanism the ability to think out of bounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">era of universal agreement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cities may have influenced the beliefs of Gemistus Pleto?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Florence, Venice, and Rome</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The humanists' close study of Latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ad fontes, or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of Patristic literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis, now called philology, to prove that the Donation of Constantine, which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery. For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world. The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were humanist able to identify the development of humanist thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin literary texts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was included in this quest for knowledge of the belief system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Patristic literature</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If your were unsure of the authenticity of an ancient text how could you verify it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused a large migration of Greek refuges in the 1450s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Byzantine Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused a large migration of Greek refuges in the 1450s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek manuscripts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist Erasmus, who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of Aldus Manutius, began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples, began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German Tübingen school.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When are these texts first able to reach a large amount of people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1517</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When are these texts first able to reach a large amount of people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Erasmus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Erasmus can be said to have lit the match that sparked a radical change in thinking in his era along with who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Lefèvre d'Étaples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What text still remained without the type of thorough review that others texts had received by the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Bible</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The words of the comic playwright P. Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond.

For them, the word &quot;secular&quot; carried no connotations of disbelief – that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base, however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was able to reconcile their religious beliefs with those of humanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Early humanists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What phrase that has come to be associated with a lack of faith was not seen as an issue for Christians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">secular</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what time period did secular have a more neutral connotation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Renaissance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Petrarch felt that although he tried to do his own form of good whose life may have more meaning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gherardo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Eliot and her circle, who included her companion George Henry Lewes (the biographer of Goethe) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau, were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte, whom Martineau had translated.

The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after.

Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of &quot;humanism&quot; until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. The Cult of Reason (French: Culte de la Raison) was a religion based on deism devised during the French Revolution by Jacques Hébert, Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their supporters. In 1793 during the French Revolution, the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was turned into a &quot;Temple to Reason&quot; and for a time Lady Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars. In the 1850s, Auguste Comte, the Father of Sociology, founded Positivism, a &quot;religion of humanity&quot;. One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts. The Ethical Culture movement was founded in 1876. The movement's founder, Felix Adler, a former member of the Free Religious Association, conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was included in religious humanism that was similiar to other religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious rituals </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did practicers of religious humanism form under the name Humanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th and early 20th centuries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded a religion whose cornerstone was deism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jacques Hébert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what time was a religious state replaced in the Notre Dame cathedral with a symbol of Humanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1793</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns.

Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists, such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. &quot;Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal&quot;, suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls &quot;a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)&quot;.

Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German &quot;race&quot; and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century &quot;it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them&quot;. For &quot;it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason&quot;. Yet, he continues, &quot;it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the book humanism published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century was the horrific wars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20th century </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only alternative to bigotry and persecution on many occasions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humanism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the book humanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tony Davies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The ad fontes principle also had many applications.

The line from a drama of Terence, Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (or with nil for nihil), meaning &quot;I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me&quot;, known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein – as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling – but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by Seneca.

The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms. Homo homini deus est (&quot;The human being is a god to humanity&quot; or &quot;god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself&quot;), Feuerbach had written.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What writing was considered a bridge between two other major writings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Age of Reason</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which century was the first writing from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th-century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who states imply that humans are their own Gods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Feuerbach</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the origin of the second writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
