In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or &quot;superior.&quot; The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the &quot;title&quot; churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the first people to be called cardinals in Rome? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the deacons of the seven regions of the city</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Roman cardinals perceived as a privleged class among the Roman clergy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the ruling &quot;only a cardinal was eligible to become pope&quot; come in effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">769</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave cardinals the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nicholas II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was it that gave cardinals the right to elect the pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Papal Bull In nomine Domini</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the pope allow cardinals to wear the red hats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1244</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the pope who gave cardinals the right to wear the hats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pope Innocent IV</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In cities other than Rome, the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour. The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III (the Short), ruler of the Franks, in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy. This meaning of the word spread rapidly, and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals.

The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the College of Cardinals. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the Pope as requested. Most have additional duties, such as leading a diocese or archdiocese or managing a department of the Roman Curia. A cardinal's primary duty is electing the pope when the see becomes vacant. During the sede vacante (the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor), the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the conclave of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The entire group of cardinals is known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">College of Cardinals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cardinals have in canon law a &quot;privilege of forum&quot; (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate ecclesiastical penalty imposed).

Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the cardinal priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome (the Latin cardo means &quot;hinge&quot;). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel — the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original definition of a cardinal priest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">priests chosen by the pope</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia, every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops are given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome. Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to celebrate mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Each cardinal priest has what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a titular church in Rome</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Pope Sixtus V put a cap on the number of cardinals in the College of Cardinals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1587</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the maximum number allowed per Pope Sixtus V?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who removed the cap on cardinals in the College of the Cardinals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pope John XXIII</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
