In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. In 1987, Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company, and in 1991, renamed it SME.

ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom, but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia. RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company. The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC's other labels. This allowed ARC's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records. Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label. Wallerstein, who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company, restored Columbia's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing (LP) record before he retired as Columbia's chairman in 1951. James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records. Also in 1951, Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records, whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought out ARC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Columbia Broadcasting System</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was ARC bought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1938</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did CBS call ARC after buying it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Columbia Recording Corporation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the head of CBS at the time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William S.

The CBS Associated label was renamed Epic Associated. Also on January 1, 1991, to replace the CBS label, Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide, which it previously held in the United States and Canada only, after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990. Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia, an unrelated company. Thus, until this day, Sony Music Entertainment Japan does not use the Columbia trademark for Columbia label recordings from outside Japan which are issued in Japan. The Columbia Records trademark's rightsholder in Spain was Bertelsmann Music Group, Germany, which Sony Music subsequently subsumed via a 2004 merger, followed by a 2008 buyout.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the name Sony Music Entertainment become the new name of Sony's record label?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did CBS Associated become Epic Associated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only country where Sony has no rights to the Columbia label?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who owns the rights to the Columbia label in Japan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nippon Columbia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
