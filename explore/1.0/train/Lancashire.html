It also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county, particularly in the textile and coalfield areas, in the 19th century. The first open competition for brass bands was held at Manchester in 1853, and continued annually until the 1980s. The vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the Hallé Orchestra from 1857, the oldest extant professional orchestra in the United Kingdom. The same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as Sir William Walton (1902–88), son of an Oldham choirmaster and music teacher, Sir Thomas Beecham (1879–1961), born in St. Helens, who began his career by conducting local orchestras and Alan Rawsthorne (1905–71) born in Haslingden. The conductor David Atherton, co-founder of the London Sinfonietta, was born in Blackpool in 1944. Lancashire also produced more populist figures, such as early musical theatre composer Leslie Stuart (1863–1928), born in Southport, who began his musical career as organist of Salford Cathedral.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the first open competition for brass bands held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchester</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the first open competition for brass bands held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1853</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was David Atherton born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blackpool</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did David Atherton co-found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the London Sinfonietta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who began their musical career as organist of Salford Cathedral?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leslie Stuart</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the Industrial Revolution.

Many Lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s, out of which by the early 1960s a flourishing culture of beat groups began to emerge, particularly around Liverpool and Manchester. It has been estimated that there were around 350 bands active in and around Liverpool in this era, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs, among them the Beatles. After their national success from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, the Searchers and Cilla Black. The first act to break through in the UK who were not from Liverpool, or managed by Brian Epstein, were Freddie and the Dreamers, who were based in Manchester, as were Herman's Hermits and the Hollies. Led by the Beatles, beat groups from the region spearheaded the British Invasion of the US, which made a major contribution to the development of rock music. After the decline of beat groups in the late 1960s the centre of rock culture shifted to London and there were relatively few local bands who achieved national prominence until the growth of a disco funk scene and the punk rock revolution in the mid and late 1970s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was pop star Frankie Vaughan from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liverpool</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bands were active in the Liverpool area in the 1960s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">350</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first act to break through in the UK, not from Liverpool or managed by Brian Epstein?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Freddie and the Dreamers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were Freddie and the Dreamers based?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchester</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were Herman's Hermints and the Hollies from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchester</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lancashire has a long and highly productive tradition of music making. In the early modern era the county shared in the national tradition of balladry, including perhaps the finest border ballad, &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot;, thought to have been composed by the Lancashire-born minstrel Richard Sheale. The county was also a common location for folk songs, including &quot;The Lancashire Miller&quot;, &quot;Warrington Ale&quot; and &quot;The soldier's farewell to Manchester&quot;, while Liverpool, as a major seaport, was the subject of many sea shanties, including &quot;The Leaving of Liverpool&quot; and &quot;Maggie May&quot;, beside several local Wassailing songs. In the Industrial Revolution changing social and economic patterns helped create new traditions and styles of folk song, often linked to migration and patterns of work. These included processional dances, often associated with rushbearing or the Wakes Week festivities, and types of step dance, most famously clog dancing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot; composed by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Richard Sheale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Richard Sheale from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lancashire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the county share with it's national traditions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">balladry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Lancashire's long and productive tradition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">music making</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the finest border ballad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Ballad of Chevy Chase</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The county was established in 1182, later than many other counties. During Roman times the area was part of the Brigantes tribal area in the military zone of Roman Britain. The towns of Manchester, Lancaster, Ribchester, Burrow, Elslack and Castleshaw grew around Roman forts. In the centuries after the Roman withdrawal in 410AD the northern parts of the county probably formed part of the Brythonic kingdom of Rheged, a successor entity to the Brigantes tribe. During the mid-8th century, the area was incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria, which became a part of England in the 10th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Lancashire established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1182</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the area part of Brigantes tribal area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the northern parts of the country form the Brythonic kingdom of Rheged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">410AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Brythonic kingdom of Rheged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a successor entity to the Brigantes tribe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the area incorporated into Northumbria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> mid-8th century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the census of 1971, the population of Lancashire and its county boroughs had reached 5,129,416, making it the most populous geographic county in the UK. The administrative county was also the most populous of its type outside London, with a population of 2,280,359 in 1961. On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative county was abolished, as were the county boroughs.

The county produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl, but also a local champion in Harry Boardman, who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the folk song of the county. Perhaps the most influential folk artists to emerge from the region in the late 20th century were Liverpool folk group The Spinners, and from Manchester folk troubadour Roy Harper and musician, comedian and broadcaster Mike Harding. The region is home to numerous folk clubs, many of them catering to Irish and Scottish folk music. Regular folk festivals include the Fylde Folk Festival at Fleetwood.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a local pioneer of folk song collection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Orchard Halliwell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the most to popularize folk songs of the county?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Harry Boardman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the most influential fold artists from the region in the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Spinners</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who do the many folk clubs today cater to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Irish and Scottish folk music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the regular folk festivals called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fylde Folk Festival</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Red Rose of Lancaster is the county flower found on the county's heraldic badge and flag.
