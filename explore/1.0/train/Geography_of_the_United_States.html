By land area only (exclusive of waters), the United States is the world's third largest country, after Russia and China, with Canada in fourth. Whether the US or China is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors: (1) The validity of China's claim on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. Both these territories are also claimed by India, so are not counted; and (2) How US calculates its own surface area.

The highest peaks of the Rockies are found in Colorado, the tallest peak being Mount Elbert at 14,440 ft (4,400 m).

It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains.

There are several active volcanoes located in the islands of Hawaii, including Kilauea in ongoing eruption since 1983, but they do not typically adversely affect the inhabitants of the islands. There has not been a major life-threatening eruption on the Hawaiian islands since the 17th century. Volcanic eruptions can occasionally be devastating, such as in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the area in the pacific known for heavy volcanic activity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pacific Ring of Fire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Hawaiin volcano has been erupting since 1983?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kilauea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Pacific Ring of Fire contains what percentage of the earthquakes on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90% </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the last time that the Hawaiin islands experienced a life threatening volcanic eruption?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Mt St. Helens erupt causing devastating damage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
