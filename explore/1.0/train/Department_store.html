Customers check out near the front of the store or, alternatively, at sales counters within each department. Some are part of a retail chain of many stores, while others may be independent retailers.

As the Industrial Revolution accelerated economy expansion, the affluent middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group, sharing a culture of consumption and changing fashion, was the catalyst for the retail revolution. As rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people, especially women (who found they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation), with disposable income in the late Georgian period, window shopping was transformed into a leisure activity and entrepreneurs, like the potter Josiah Wedgwood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of society.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the idea of a &quot;consumer society&quot; begin? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at the turn of the 19th century.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What social group grew as a result of the industrial revolution? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the affluent middle-class</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Josiah Wedgewood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">entrepreneur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one explanation for the rise of retail stores in earlier history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">urbanized social group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of people were suddenly free to go shopping without fears of being judged or reprimanded? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">women</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>All the major British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century.

Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne &amp; Faulkner) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal's, despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser. The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796. At its zenith the store had buildings on both sides of Deansgate linked by a subterranean passage &quot;Kendals Arcade&quot; and an art nouveau tiled food hall. The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname &quot;the Harrods of the North&quot;, although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919. Other large Manchester stores included Paulden's (currently Debenhams) and Lewis's (now a Primark).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became the predominant shoppers for individual households in the nineteenth century? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">women </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What business in Manchester claims to be the first department store? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne &amp; Faulkner)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Kendals change it's name to in 2005? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Fraser</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Manchester institution begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1836 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who acquired the Manchester store in 1919? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harrods </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Selfridges was established in 1909 by American-born Harry Gordon Selfridge on Oxford Street. The company's innovative marketing promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over. The store was extensively promoted through paid advertising. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and &quot;Colonial&quot; customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers, but not too aggressively, and to sell the merchandise. Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits; – in 1909, Louis Blériot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Blériot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Selfridges in 1909?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harry Gordon Selfridge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made Selfridges different from many department stores at the time? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the store most often presented to the public? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paid advertising</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of customers did Selfridges most often cater to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Paris department store had its roots in the magasin de nouveautés, or novelty store; the first, the Tapis Rouge, was created in 1784.

Balzac described their functioning in his novel César Birotteau.

It originally had four departments, twelve employees, and a floor space of three hundred meters. The entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut became a partner in 1852, and changed the marketing plan, instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds, advertising, and a much wider variety of merchandise. The annual income of the store increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860. In 1869 he built much larger building at 24 rue de Sèvres on the Left Bank, and enlarged the store again in 1872, with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel, creator of the Eiffel Tower. The income rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million at the time of the Boucicaut's death in 1877. The floor space had increased from three hundred square meters in 1838 to fifty thousand, and the number of employees had increased from twelve in 1838 to 1788 in 1879. Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped; extensive newspaper advertising; entertainment for children; and six million catalogs sent out to customers. By 1880 half the employees were women; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What store was founded in Paris, in 1838, which sold a wide variety of products? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Au Bon Marché</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became a partner to this store in 1852 and drastically changed operations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aristide Boucicaut</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the change in profit to Au Bon Marche after these changes? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What engineering company helped the store expand in 1872</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gustave Eiffel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Boucicaut most widely known for? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">marketing innovations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Grands Magasins Dufayel was a huge department store with inexpensive prices built in 1890 in the northern part of Paris, where it reached a very large new customer base in the working class.

It educated workers to approach shopping as an exciting social activity not just a routine exercise in obtaining necessities, just as the bourgeoisie did at the famous department stores in the central city. Like the bourgeois stores, it helped transform consumption from a business transaction into a direct relationship between consumer and sought-after goods.

It was founded in 1825 by Aaron Arnold (1794?-1876), an emigrant from Great Britain, as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City. In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House. During the Civil War Arnold, Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis. Recognized as an emporium for high-quality fashions, the store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869; this “Palace of Trade” expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914. In 1925, Arnold, Constable merged with Stewart &amp; Company and expanded into the suburbs, first with a 1937 store in New Rochelle, New York and later in Hempstead and Manhasset on Long Island, and in New Jersey. Financial problems led to bankruptcy in 1975.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is recognized as the &quot;first&quot; department store in America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arnold, Constable</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Arnold, Constable? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aaron Arnold</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the store moved in 1857?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made Arnold, Constable stand out from other stores during the civil war? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the &quot;Palace of Trade&quot; built? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1869</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In New York City in 1846, Alexander Turney Stewart established the &quot;Marble Palace&quot; on Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets. He offered European retail merchandise at fixed prices on a variety of dry goods, and advertised a policy of providing &quot;free entrance&quot; to all potential customers. Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases.

Both, Myer and David Jones, are up-market chains, offering a wide variety of products from mid-range names to luxury brands. Other retail chain stores such as Target (unrelated to the American chain of the same name), Venture (now defunct), Kmart and Big W, also located nationally, are considered to be Australia's discount department stores. Harris Scarfe, though only operating in four states and one territory, is a department store using both the large full-line and small discount department store formats. Most department stores in Australia have their own credit card companies, each having their own benefits while the discount department stores do not have their own credit card rights.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were some of the original Australian department stores? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grace Bros. and Waltons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Sydney Myer come to Australia? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1899 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Myer Retail Group open it's first store? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bendigo, Victoria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of department stores are Myer and David Jones? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up-market chains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What department store brand is now out of business in Australia? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Venture </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From its origins in the fur trade, the Hudson's Bay Company is the oldest corporation in North America and was the largest department store operator in Canada until the mid-1980s, with locations across the country. It also previously owned Zellers, another major Canadian department store which ceased to exist in March 2013 after selling its lease holdings to Target Canada. Other department stores in Canada are: Canadian Tire, Sears Canada, Ogilvy, Les Ailes de la Mode, Giant Tiger, Co-op, Costco and Holt Renfrew. Grocery giant Superstores carry many non-grocery items akin to a department store. Woolco had 160 stores in Canada when operations ceased (Walmart bought out Woolco in 1994). Today low-price Walmart is by far the most dominant department store retailer in Canada with outlets throughout the country. Historically, department stores were a significant component in Canadian economic life, and chain stores such as Eaton's, Charles Ogilvy Limited, Freiman's, Spencer's, Simpsons, Morgan's, and Woodward's were staples in their respective communities. Department stores in Canada are similar in design and style to department stores in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What business was the Hudson's Bay Company originally involved in? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the fur trade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What department store chain did Hudson's Bay Company own until it dissolved in 2013?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zellers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many stores did Woolco operate before selling their shares to Walmart? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">160 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Currently, what department store is most popular in Canada? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Walmart </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before the 1950s, the department store held an eminent place in both Canada and Australia, during both the Great Depression and World War II. Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from specialist stores. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of larger-scale superstores (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them. The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping malls. In 2003, U.S. department store sales were surpassed by big-box store sales for the first time (though some stores may be classified as &quot;big box&quot; by physical layout and &quot;department store&quot; by merchandise).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one type of competition department stores face? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">specialist stores</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of stores have created even more competition? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">superstores</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factor lead to a decrease in department store shoppers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were department store sales beaten by larger stores?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the opening policy in 1979, the Chinese department stores also develops swiftly along with the fast-growing economy.

It had been occupied by various shops and warehouses (Maly Gostiny Dvor, Schukin Dvor, Apraksin Dvor) until 1846, when Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor acquired the grounds to build an elite shopping mall for the Russian nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie. Stenbock-Fermor conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping mall, but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg. The edifice contained coffee-houses, confectioneries, panorama installations, an anatomical museum, a wax museum, and even a small zoo, described by Dostoyevsky in his extravaganza &quot;Crocodile, or Passage through the Passage&quot;. The concert hall became renowned as a setting for literary readings attended by the likes of Dostoevsky and Turgenev.

It operated stores throughout Russia and targeted consumers across class, gender, and ethnic lines. GUM was designed to advance the Bolsheviks' goals of eliminating private enterprise and rebuilding consumerism along socialist lines, as well as democratizing consumption for workers and peasants nationwide. GUM became a major propaganda purveyor, with advertising and promotional campaigns that taught Russians the goals of the regime and attempted to inculcate new attitudes and behavior. In trying to create a socialist consumer culture from scratch, GUM recast the functions and meanings of buying and selling, turning them into politically charged acts that could either contribute to or delay the march toward utopian communism. By the late 1920s, however, GUM's gandiose goals had proven unrealistic and largely alienated consumers, who instead learned a culture of complaint and entitlement. GUM's main function became one of distributing whatever the factories sent them, regardless of consumer demand or quality.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group was established in 1921 in response to the clash between socialism and consumerism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">State Department Stores (GUM)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did GUM begin to decline and lose power? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 1920s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who formed the State Department Stores, AKA GUM? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lenin </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did they first establish the organization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1921 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 21st century the most famous department store in Russia is GUM in Moscow, followed by TsUM and the Petrovsky Passage.
