Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. In the 2010s, lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the practice of killing or trapping any animal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hunting </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do humans most commonly hunt wildlife?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">food</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is there a distinction between lawful hunting and?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poaching</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is poaching?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the species which is hunted referred to as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prey </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the practice of killing or trapping any animal called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hunting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was lawful hunting distinguished from poaching?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Illegally killing, capturing or trapping an hunted species is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> poaching</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hunted species are usually referred to as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">game or prey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animals are usually hunted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mammals and birds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called to kill or trap an animal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hunting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species are usually hunted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mammals and birds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do humans hunt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">food, recreation, to remove predators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was lawful hunting distinguished from poaching?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Species hunted are referred to as what? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> game or prey</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Furthermore, evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores.

Man's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks, spears, the atlatl, and bows and arrows.

Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha, which translates as &quot;the deer hunter&quot; (mriga means deer; vyadha means hunter). The word Mriga, in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic Ramayana, Dasharatha, the father of Rama, is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed Shravana, mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, Ravana kidnapped his wife, Sita, from their hut, while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother Lakshman went after him. According to the Mahabharat, Pandu, the father of the Pandavas, accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow, mistaking them for a deer. Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of occupation do Hindu scriptures describe hunting as being?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acceptable </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the names of the god Shiva?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mrigavyadha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the translation of Mrigavyadha?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;the deer hunter&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Shiva destroy in human beings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">animal instincts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What talent does Dasharatha have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hunt in the dark</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What scriptures describe hunting as and acceptable occupation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hindu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Godly figures have engaged in what activity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hunting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mrigavyadha means what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> deer hunter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mrigavyadha destroys animal instinct in who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">human beings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened after Krishna was accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">died</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From early Christian times, hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics.

What in other countries is called &quot;hunting&quot; is called &quot;shooting&quot; (birds) or &quot;stalking&quot; (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of hunting is most closely associated with the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fox hunting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do the English hunt foxes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on horseback with hounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In England, what is hunted when &quot;shooting&quot; is called for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">birds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were foxes originally hunted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">form of vermin control to protect livestock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is deer stalking with rifles carried out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on foot without hounds, using stealth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What hunting is done on horseback with hounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> fox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hunting horseback with hound is associated with whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Victorian times a popular social activity was?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> fox hunting </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is carried out on foot without hounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Deer stalking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hounds were used for what purpose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to pursue</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Shooting as practised in Britain, as opposed to traditional hunting, requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year, some having been factory farmed.

Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average.

Common varmints may include various rodents, coyotes, crows, foxes, feral cats, and feral hogs. Some animals once considered varmints are now protected, such as wolves.

Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many sport hunters applied for hunting licences in recent years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12,000 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is there a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Trinidad and Tobago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is there a very lucrative and thriving black market for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poached wild game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is hunting pressure from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What very active tradition Trinidad and Tabago have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hunting of small to medium-sized wild game </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal aids in the hunting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> hounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What population has extirpated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">red brocket deer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do hunters pay to obtain hunting license?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">very small fees</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species, or, in some instances, damage human health or safety.[citation needed] However, in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability, and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population of species.[citation needed] In some cases, it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established, resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area, thus artificially increasing the population.

Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport.[citation needed] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit of trophies.

However, the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What large species of antelope once made its home in the desert areas of the Middle East?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Arabian oryx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did sport hunters find the Arabian oryx to be a worthwhile quarry to hunt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the species' striking appearance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Arabian oryx become extinct in the wild due to sport hunting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1972</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did hunters obliterate the advantage bestowed upon the oryx by evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">use of automobiles and high-powered rifles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal has made a miraculous comeback and been upgraded from &quot;extinct in the wild&quot; to &quot;vulnerable&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arabian oryx </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a species of large antelope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arabian oryx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the large antelope species once inhabit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">much of the desert areas of the Middle East</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What destroyed the Arabian oryx only advantage of speed.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">automobiles and high-powered rifles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Arabian oryx become extinct?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1972</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What contributed to the Arabian oryx rise from extinct to vulnerable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conservation efforts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s, living on the prairies in large herds. However, the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters, who killed dozens of bison for their hides only, leaving the rest to rot. Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds, bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s. Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase, but the bison remains near-threatened.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of creature is the American bison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a large bovid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the American bison inhabit much of prior to the 1800s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> western North America </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did market hunters leave the parts of the bison they didn't need to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of bison herds around prior to being eliminated by thousands of market hunters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the current status of bison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> near-threatened</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did large herds of bison attract?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">market hunters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of North America did the bison live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> western</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were the bison killed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">for their hides </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did hunter do with the rest of the bison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">leaving the rest to rot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do bison still remain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">near-threatened</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In contrast, Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline. The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana, with a resultant decline in predator numbers, while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose. According to the government of Botswana, trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this, but many other factors, such as poaching, drought and habitat loss are also to blame. Uganda recently did the same, arguing that &quot;the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [Uganda's] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why has Botswana been forced to ban trophy hunting altogether?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a precipitous wildlife decline</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What plummeting numbers of this species caused a decline in predator numbers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antelope </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species saw its numbers rising while elephant numbers remained stable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hippopotamus </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factors other than trophy hunting are responsible for the decline of wildlife in Botswana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poaching, drought and habitat loss </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other African country has also recently banned trophy hunting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uganda </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Botswana was resently forced to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ban trophy hunting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal declined across Botswana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antelope</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal numbers have increased in Botswana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hippopotamus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal numbers remain stable in Botswana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> elephant </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else is partly to blame for the declining number of animals in Botswana and Uganda? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poaching</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
