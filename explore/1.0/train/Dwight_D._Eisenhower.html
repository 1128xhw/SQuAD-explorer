He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala. Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam. He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam.

He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action. In 1958, Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution. Near the end of his term, his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident. In his January 17, 1961 farewell address to the nation, Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending, particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers, and coined the term &quot;military–industrial complex&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Israel, what countries' armies invaded Egypt in 1956?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British and French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Soviets launch humanity's first artificial satellite?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1957</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization did Eisenhower support after the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">NASA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Eisenhower deliver his presidential farewell address?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> January 17, 1961</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Eisenhower send 15,000 military personnel in 1958?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lebanon </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On the domestic front, he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege.

Admiral Ernest J. King fought with Eisenhower over King's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific. He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, as he did. Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and Eisenhower prevailed.

A month later, the invasion of Southern France took place, and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF. Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year. From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8, 1945, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded all Allied forces, and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps. He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families.

Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group's attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley (12th U.S. Army Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. Army Group) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical, though sometimes ineffective, latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Eisenhower's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944, and victory became a more distinct probability.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What unit did Montgomery command?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21st Army Group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What general commanded the 12th US Army Group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bradley </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What geographic portion of the front did the Sixth US Army Group operate on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">south </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Sixth US Army Group's commander?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Devers </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What supply port was opened late in 1944?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antwerp </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, he was promoted to General of the Army, equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies.

Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle.

The British wanted Berlin, but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin, and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit. The British backed down, but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons. Washington refused to support Churchill's plan to use Eisenhower's army for political maneuvers against Moscow.

Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials. He reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention. Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067, but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization. In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment.

Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon. Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, &quot;First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.&quot; Initially, Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets. He even visited Warsaw in 1945. Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city. However, by mid-1947, as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Chief of Staff of the Army before Eisenhower?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marshall </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many soldiers demobilized after the war ended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">millions </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What president ignored Eisenhower's recommendations in regard to atomic weapons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Truman </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Eisenhower's position on the use of nuclear weapons against Japan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opposed </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city did Eisenhower notably visit in 1945?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Warsaw </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war.

Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate.

A &quot;Draft Eisenhower&quot; movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, &quot;I Like Ike&quot;. It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated. In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose.

Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment, for the Soviet Union's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race, and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In popular memory, what sport was Eisenhower known for playing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">golf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did critics feel that Eisenhower should have opposed in public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">McCarthyism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Central High school located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Little Rock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did critics characterize Kennedy in comparison to Eisenhower?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> vigorous young successor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nation was considered the leader in the nuclear arms race?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the 19th century, many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or &quot;gatekeeper&quot;, sometimes described as the President's Private Secretary, sometimes with no official title at all. Eisenhower formalized this role, introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff – an idea he borrowed from the United States Army. Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position. Initially, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a chief of staff, but each eventually appointed one.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where did Eisenhower get the idea of a White House Chief of Staff?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the last president not to appoint a Chief of Staff?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lyndon Johnson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Ford, what president initially didn't appoint a Chief of Staff but later did?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jimmy Carter </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 19th century informal political office did the modern role of White House Chief of Staff correspond to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President's Private Secretary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.

Commemorative signs reading &quot;Eisenhower Interstate System&quot; and bearing Eisenhower's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System.
