Greco-Roman (Mid- and Neo-Platonic, and Aristotelian) texts translated by the Kindi school were commented, redacted and developed substantially by Islamic intellectuals, who also built upon Persian and Indian mathematical systems, astronomy, algebra, trigonometry and medicine. The Samanid dynasty in the eastern part of Persia, Greater Khorasan and Central Asia as well as the Buyid dynasty in the western part of Persia and Iraq provided a thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development.

Janssens demonstrated that Avicenna was a Sunni Hanafi. However, the 14th cenutry Shia faqih Nurullah Shushtari according to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, maintained that he was most likely a Twelver Shia. Conversely, Sharaf Khorasani, citing a rejection of an invitation of the Sunni Governor Sultan Mahmoud Ghazanavi by Avicenna to his court, believes that Avicenna was an Ismaili. Similar disagreements exist on the background of Avicenna's family, whereas some writers considered them Sunni, some more recent writers contested that they were Shia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What secret society was Avicenna considered to be a follower of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Brethren of Purity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who thought that Avicenna was a Brethren of Purity follower?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Medieval historian Ẓahīr al-dīn al-Bayhaqī</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Islamic denomination was Avicenna thought to be a member of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sunni</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who thought Avicenna was a Shia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nurullah Shushtari</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of one man who thought Avicenna was Sunni?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jules J.

Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams.

Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of Mahmud of Ghazni, and proceeded westwards to Urgench in modern Turkmenistan, where the vizier, regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of Nishapur and Merv to the borders of Khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents. Qabus, the generous ruler of Tabaristan, himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at Gorgan, near the Caspian Sea, Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on logic and astronomy. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his Canon of Medicine also dates from his stay in Hyrcania.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Avicenna lose his father?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty ended in December 1004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Samanid dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What modern country did Ibn Sina travel to after the end of the Samanid dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turkmenistan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one district that Ibn Sina traveled through in search of more work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nishapur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Ibn Sina turn down in order to travel westwards after the Samanid dynasty ended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mahmud of Ghazni</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ibn Sina subsequently settled at Rey, in the vicinity of modern Tehran, the home town of Rhazes; where Majd Addaula, a son of the last Buwayhid emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother (Seyyedeh Khatun). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, Shams al-Daula, however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at Qazvin he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the Canon and the Sanatio, were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city did Ibn Sina settle in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What modern city of today was Rey in the vicinity of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tehran</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of Ibn Sina's shorter works were said to have been created in Rey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thirty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ibn Sina left Rey and moved southwards to what city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Hamadãn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What office did Ibn Sina receive in Hamadan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">office of vizier</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Meanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of Isfahan, offering his services.

When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'.

Avicenna believed his &quot;Floating Man&quot; thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from sense experience, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this &quot;Floating Man&quot; indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature.

Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing, and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms, but as a primary given, a substance.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Avicenna ground his psychology on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">physiology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Avicenna, the body and soul must be what in order to ensure the soul's individuation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strong enough</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Avicenna  explain the connection between body and soul?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his understanding of perception</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does man first perceive features of an object?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">external senses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The body and soul's interaction takes place where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the physical body</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than Alhazen or Al-Biruni.

The third work (The Book of Minerals) is agreed to be Avicenna's writing, adapted from the Kitab al-Shifa (Book of the Remedy). Ibn Sina classified minerals into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs, and salts, building on the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir. The epistola de Re recta is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna, but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What work by Avicenna is thought to be a fake?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another work of Avicenna that is said to not be his creation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Declaratio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is definitely seen as being written by Avicenna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Book of Minerals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the kitab al-Shifa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Book of the Remedy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ibn Sina classify into stones?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">minerals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>George Sarton, the author of The History of Science, described Ibn Sīnā as &quot;one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history&quot; and called him &quot;the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times.&quot; He was one of the Islamic world's leading writers in the field of medicine. Along with Rhazes, Abulcasis, Ibn al-Nafis, and al-Ibadi, Ibn Sīnā is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western history of medicine as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European Renaissance. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge. Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the Canon of Medicine (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the Canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, princeps medicorum (&quot;prince of physicians&quot;).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said that Ibn Sina was one of the greatest thinkers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Sarton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did George Sarton write?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The History of Science</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ibn Sina was described as the most famous scientist in what religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is another leading Islamic figure in medicine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abulcasis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what centuries was Ibn Sina ranked among such medical greats as Hippocrates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In modern Iran, he is considered a national icon, and is often regarded as one of the greatest Persians to have ever lived.
