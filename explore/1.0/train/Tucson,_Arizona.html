The 2010 United States Census put the population at 520,116, while the 2013 estimated population of the entire Tucson metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was 996,544. The Tucson MSA forms part of the larger Tucson-Nogales combined statistical area (CSA), with a total population of 980,263 as of the 2010 Census. Tucson is the second-largest populated city in Arizona behind Phoenix, both of which anchor the Arizona Sun Corridor. The city is  located 108 miles (174 km) southeast of Phoenix and 60 mi (97 km) north of the U.S.-Mexico border. Tucson is the 33rd largest city and the 59th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Roughly 150 Tucson companies are involved in the design and manufacture of optics and optoelectronics systems, earning Tucson the nickname Optics Valley.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the largest populated city in Arizona?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phoenix</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles is Tuscon from the U.S.- Mexico border?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nickname does Tuscon have because of their many companies involved in optics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Optics Valley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of Tuscon according to the 2010 U.S. Census? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">520,116</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the estimated population of the entire Tuscan area in 2013? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">996,544</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which county is Tucson in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pima County</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which university is in Tucson?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> University of Arizona</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far is Tucson from Phoenix?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 108 miles (174 km) </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far is Tucson from Mexico?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60 mi (97 km)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What industry-based nickname does Tucson have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Optics Valley</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tucson was probably first visited by Paleo-Indians, known to have been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological excavations near the Santa Cruz River have located a village site dating from 2100 BC.[citation needed] The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was extensively farmed during the Early Agricultural period, circa 1200 BC to AD 150. These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn, beans, and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting. The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the Hohokam lived in the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Tuscon known as 12,000 years ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">southern Arizona</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group lived in the area that were known for their red-on-brown pottery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hohokam </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Near what river was a village site dating from 2100 BC found? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Santa Cruz River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were probably the first group of people in Tuscan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Paleo-Indians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long ago did Tuscan have their first visitors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 12,000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long ago were Paleo-Indians known to be in the Tucson area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 12,000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was the village site found near the Santa Cruz River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2100 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Early Agricultural period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1200 BC to AD 150</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened in the Early Ceramic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Hohokam live in the Tucson area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> from AD 600 to 1450</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jesuit missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692, and founded the Mission San Xavier del Bac in 1700 about 7 mi (11 km) upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now &quot;A&quot; mountain. Hugo O'Conor, the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón, on August 20, 1775 (near the present downtown Pima County Courthouse). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the Second Battle of Tucson were repeatedly mounted by Apaches. Eventually the town came to be called &quot;Tucson&quot; and became a part of Sonora after Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Mexico gain independence from Spain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1821</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is considered the founding father of Tuscan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugo O'Conor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Mission San Xavier del Bac?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Eusebio Francisco Kino</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles was Mission San Xavier del Bac from Tuscon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which missionary came to the Santa Cruz River area in 1692?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eusebio Francisco Kino</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion was Kino?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jesuit </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mission did Kino found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mission San Xavier del Bac</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Kino found the del Bac mission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1700 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Tucson's 'founding father'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugo O'Conor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Arizona, south of the Gila River was legally bought from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase on June 8, 1854.

Most notable, however, were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent William Whitney Brazelton. Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station approximately 17 mi (27 km) northwest of Tucson. John Clum, of Tombstone, Arizona fame was one of the passengers. Brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed on Monday August 19, 1878, in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River 3 miles (5 km) south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell and his citizen's posse. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery not only in the Tucson area, but also in the Prescott region and Silver City, New Mexico area as well. Brazelton's crimes prompted John J. Valentine, Sr. of Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. to send special agent and future Pima County sheriff Bob Paul to investigate. Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, was established to help protect settlers from Apache attacks. In 1882, Frank Stilwell was implicated in the murder of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence's wife, Marietta, at the coroner's inquest on Morgan Earp's shooting. The coroner's jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, and Florentino &quot;Indian Charlie&quot; Cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of Morgan Earp. :250 Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a few trusted friends and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family as they traveled to Benson for a train ride to California. They found Stilwell lying in wait for Virgil in the Tucson station and killed him on the tracks. After killing Stilwell, Wyatt deputized others and rode on a vendetta, killing three more cowboys over the next few days before leaving the state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date did William Whitney Brazelton Die? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 19, 1878</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the sheriff who shot William Whitney Brazelton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles A.

It is generally classified as the area of the city east of Swan Road, with above-average real estate values relative to the rest of the city. The area includes urban and suburban development near the Rincon Mountains. East Tucson includes Saguaro National Park East. Tucson's &quot;Restaurant Row&quot; is also located on the east side, along with a significant corporate and financial presence. Restaurant Row is sandwiched by three of Tucson's storied Neighborhoods: Harold Bell Wright Estates, named after the famous author's ranch which occupied some of that area prior to the depression; the Tucson Country Club (the third to bear the name Tucson Country Club), and the Dorado Country Club. Tucson's largest office building is 5151 East Broadway in east Tucson, completed in 1975. The first phases of Williams Centre, a mixed-use, master-planned development on Broadway near Craycroft Road, were opened in 1987.

Lowell Roads are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In 1891, the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In 1900, three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to Harvey Adkins in 1928. The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort – transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage and New Mexican experience. Other artists and academics throughout the middle of the 20th century, including: Win Ellis, Jack Maul, Madame Cheruy, Giorgio Belloli, Charels Bode, Veronica Hughart, Edward and Rosamond Spicer, Hazel Larson Archer and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived in the area. The artist colony attracted writers and poets including beat generation Alan Harrington and Jack Kerouac whose visit is documented in his iconic book On the Road. This rural pocket in the middle of the city is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Each year in February the neighborhood celebrates its history in the City Landmark it owns and restored the San Pedro Chapel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought The sanitarium in 1928?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Harvey Adkins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year where three officer building bought and used for a sanitarium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1900</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jack Kerouac authored what iconic book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> On the Road</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Alan Harrington is considered part of what generation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">beat generation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which month does the neighborhood celebrates its history in the City Landmark?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Fort Lowell shut down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1891</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were some buildings of Fort Lowell bought to be used for in 1900?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a sanitarium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought the Fort Lowell sanitarium in 1928?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Harvey Adkins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who renovated Fort Lowell's adobe buildings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what book did Jack Kerouac write about visiting Tucson?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">On the Road</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Southeast Tucson continues to experience rapid residential development.

It typically continues through August and sometimes into September. During the monsoon, the humidity is much higher than the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have &quot;feet of water&quot; scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. Arizona traffic code Title 28-910, the so-called &quot;Stupid Motorist Law&quot;, was instituted in 1995 to discourage people from entering flooded roadways. If the road is flooded and a barricade is in place, motorists who drive around the barricade can be charged up to $2000 for costs involved in rescuing them.

Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33¢ for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64¢ per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003).

Tucson was awarded a gold rating for bicycle-friendliness by the League of American Bicyclists in 2006.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is cycling popular in Tucson?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its flat terrain and dry climate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is The Loop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a network of seven linear parks </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles of trails are in The Loop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 100</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization advises the Tucson government on bike concerns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tucson-Pima County Bicycle Advisory Committee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of places to ride bikes does Tucson have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">marked bike routes, signal crossings, on-street bike lanes, mountain-biking trails, and dedicated shared-use paths</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
