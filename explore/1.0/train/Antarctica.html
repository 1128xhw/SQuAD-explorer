Antarctica is considered a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F), though the average for the third quarter (the coldest part of the year) is −63 °C (−81 °F). There are no permanent human residents, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is tundra.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of land is Antarctica considered to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">desert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Antarctica's annual precipitation along the coast?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200 mm (8 in)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Antarctica's average temperature during the coldest part of the year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">−63 °C (−81 °F)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many people live throughout the year at research stations across Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some animals native to Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which continent is the highest in elevation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antarctica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the annual precipitation rate of coastal Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200 mm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average coldest temperature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">−63 °C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the coldest recorded temperature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">−89.2 °C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ehat is the vegetation type on Antarctica? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tundra</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the Andes mountain range of South America.

There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island.

More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,000 km (7,456 mi). Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution – fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5 °C, and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport eggs and larval stages.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Part of what study is the census of Antarctic marine life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Census of Marine Life </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the census of sea life carried out in Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> International Polar Year</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many sea animals live in Earth's polar regions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">235</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides birds, what large animals travel from one pole to the other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cetaceans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the amount of difference in temperature  in the deep ocean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 °C</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole.

In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau.

The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem.

Cook came within about 120 km (75 mi) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km (20 mi) from Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W﻿ / ﻿69.35778°S 2.24722°W﻿ / -69.35778; -2.24722, which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis, apparently at Hughes Bay, near Cape Charles, in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim. The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in 1895.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Cook's ships cross the Antarctic circle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 January 1773</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kept Captain Cook from getting too close to Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">field ice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many men sighted Antarctica in 1820?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> three </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How close did von Bellingshausen and Lazarev come to Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 32 km</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first recorded landing on Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1895</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the 1970s, an important focus of study has been the ozone layer in the atmosphere above Antarctica.

East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the Devonian period (416 Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centered on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of climate did Gondwana have during the Cambrian period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mild </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what hemisphere did west Antarctica share during the Cambrian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Northern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was east Antarctica during the Cambrian period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> equator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the climate of Gondwana at the beginning of the Devonian period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cooler</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Gondwana located by the end of the Devonian period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South Pole</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Antarctica (US English i/æntˈɑːrktɪkə/, UK English /ænˈtɑːktɪkə/ or /ænˈtɑːtɪkə/ or /ænˈɑːtɪkə/)[Note 1] is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic South Pole.

For comparison, this is 10.7 °C (20 °F) colder than subliming dry ice at one atmosphere of partial pressure, but since CO2 only makes up 0.039% of air, temperatures of less than −150 °C (−238 °F) would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica. Antarctica is a frozen desert with little precipitation; the South Pole itself receives less than 10 cm (4 in) per year, on average. Temperatures reach a minimum of between −80 °C (−112 °F) and −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between 5 °C (41 °F) and 15 °C (59 °F) near the coast in summer. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.

Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what do some scientists believe ozone depletion may have a role ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">climatic change</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much cooling can ozone depletion cause over Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 °C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What light does ozone absorb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ultraviolet radiation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can the wind changes due to cooling cause in the Antarctic ice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">accelerated melting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does ozone depletion cause in the southern atmosphere?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enhanced polar vortex </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Several governments maintain permanent manned research stations on the continent.

The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the Adelie Land meteorite. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What astronomical study is important research for Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Meteorites </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the supposed source of most Antarctica meteorites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> asteroids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first meteorite found in Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1912</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What expedition found nine meteorites in 1969?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Japanese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it about Antarctic meteorites that is different form meteorites found in other places?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> well-preserved.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What location means that Antarctica get little solar radiation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> South Pole</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what condition is most water in the Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> ice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the usual condition of precipitation in the Antarctic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">snow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the massed snow in Antarctica produce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">giant ice sheet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are ice streams otherwise called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glaciers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the Antarctic Convergence) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on South Georgia, from 1786 onward.

This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in Antarctica has warming been noticed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Antarctic Peninsula</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some researchers believe to be that cause of this warming?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">carbon dioxide emissions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much has west Antarctica warmed per decade in the last 5o years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 0.1 °C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is thought to be the cause of glacier outflow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inflow of warm water</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the thinking of the cause  of the Antarctic Peninsula sea level.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">atmospheric warming</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom.

The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of the the poles is colder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antarctica </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How high is the continent of Antarctica above sea level?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3,000 m</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the Arctic Ocean warm the Arctic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">warmth is transferred</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What contributes to the Antarctic cold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">orbital distance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does temperature do with elevation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decreases </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Emilio Marcos Palma was the first person born south of the 60th parallel south (the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty), as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland, in 1978 at Base Esperanza, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station. As of 2009, eleven children were born in Antarctica (south of the 60th parallel south): eight at the Argentine Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person born south of the 60th parallel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emilio Marcos Palma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the continental limit of Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60th parallel south</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Palma born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1978</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Palma family sent to Antarctica to determine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">suitable for family life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Juan Pablo Camacho born on Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frei Montalva Station</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many species of fungi have been found on Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1150</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of fungi help shape rock formations in Antarctica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cryptoendoliths</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of the extant fungi in Antarctica are lichen-forming?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has the study of fungi in Antarctica shown about these organisms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">adaptations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is it postulated that Mars life might have evolved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">similar to Antarctic </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction.

The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, &quot;site use guidelines&quot; setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sightseeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard.

Geologists tend to study plate tectonics, meteorites from outer space, and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating ice, seasonal snow, glaciers, and ice sheets. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station study the celestial dome and cosmic microwave background radiation. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimizes the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of light pollution, thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest neutrino telescope in the world, built 2 km (1.2 mi) below Amundsen–Scott station.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of scientists study tectonics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geologists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is interested in the effects of harsh environment on humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Biologists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which science is concerned with the study of the dynamics of ice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Glaciologists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of observations use  the high elevations and thin atmosphere for viewing space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">astronomical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the largest neutrino telescope on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amundsen–Scott station.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
