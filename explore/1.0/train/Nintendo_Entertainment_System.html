However, it was eventually decided that children might step on joysticks left on the floor and their durability was also questioned. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game &amp; Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and had no discomfort. Ultimately though, they did install a 15-pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an arcade-style joystick could be used optionally.

Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game, and unlike movie rentals, a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day. Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals, but didn't take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large-scale service. Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive up the cost of games. Nintendo lost the lawsuit, but did win on a claim of copyright infringement. Blockbuster was banned from including original, copyrighted instruction booklets with their rented games. In compliance with the ruling, Blockbuster produced their own short instructions—usually in the form of a small booklet, card, or label stuck on the back of the rental box—that explained the game's basic premise and controls. Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games and still do today.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who caused Nintendo to take formal action regarding rentals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blockbuster Video</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Nintendo what was the danger in renting games?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">would significantly hurt sales and drive up the cost of games</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Blockbuster was banned from including what with their games?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">copyrighted instruction booklets </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Blockbuster do instead of use copyrighted instruction booklets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">produced their own short instructions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the UK, Italy and Australia which share the PAL A region, two versions of the NES were released; the &quot;Mattel Version&quot; and &quot;NES Version&quot;.

The NES Advantage had two knobs that adjusted the firing rate of the turbo button from quick to Turbo, as well as a &quot;Slow&quot; button that slowed down the game by rapidly pausing the game. The &quot;Slow&quot; button did not work with games that had a pause menu or pause screen and can interfere with jumping and shooting. The NES Max also had the Turbo Feature, but it was not adjustable, in contrast with the Advantage. It also did not have the &quot;Slow&quot; button. Its wing-like shape made it easier to hold than the Advantage and it also improved on the joystick. Turbo features were also featured on the NES Satellite, the NES Four Score, and the U-Force.

The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work. Dirty, aging and bent connectors would often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect. Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users attempted to solve this problem by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. These attempted solutions often became notable in their own right and are often remembered alongside the NES. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system.[citation needed] In 1989, Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the console's most common problem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blinking red power light</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The 10NES would reset the system how often?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">once per second</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What disrupted the communication as well?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dirty, aging and bent connectors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one example of what users did to combat the blinking problem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blowing air onto the cartridge connectors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Nintendo release a cleaning kit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1989</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Subsequent plans to market a Famicom console in North America featuring a keyboard, cassette data recorder, wireless joystick controller and a special BASIC cartridge under the name &quot;Nintendo Advanced Video System&quot; likewise never materialized.

More advanced memory management chips (MMC) soon appeared and the FDS quickly became obsolete. Nintendo also charged developers considerable amounts of money to produce FDS games, and many refused to develop for it, instead continuing to make cartridge titles. Many FDS disks have no dust covers (except in some unlicensed and bootleg variants) and are easily prone to getting dirt on the media. In addition, the drive use a belt which breaks frequently and requires invasive replacement.

The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from &quot;lock&quot; to &quot;key&quot;, removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating &quot;This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System&quot;.

Masayuki Uemura designed the system. Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead decided to go for a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the Famicom system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Masayuki Uemura</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The plans called for how many bits as a feature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Nintendo president at the time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hiroshi Yamauchi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the test model constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> October 1982</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Early Famicom games were written on what computer system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">NEC PC-8001</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A number of special controllers designed for use with specific games were released for the system, though very few such devices proved particularly popular.

Instead, it contained a book called the Official Nintendo Player's Guide, which contained detailed information for every NES game made up to that point.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was the selling price equivalent to in today's money?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$475</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the Deluxe NES sell for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$199.99</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the console sell for bundled with just the Super Mario Bros. game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$99.99</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Super Mario Bros was paired with which game in the Action Set?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Duck Hunt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Basic Set sold for how much at release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$89.99</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The unlicensed clone market has flourished following Nintendo's discontinuation of the NES.

Before the NES/Famicom, Nintendo was known as a moderately successful Japanese toy and playing card manufacturer, and the popularity of the NES/Famicom helped the company grow into an internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games as Atari had been during the 2600 era and set the stage for Japanese dominance of the video game industry. With the NES, Nintendo also changed the relationship of console manufacturers and third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval. This led to higher quality software titles, which helped to change the attitude of a public that had grown weary from poorly produced titles for other game systems of the day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nintendo produced toys and what other item before its game system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">playing card</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nintendo's era was compared with who as another video game manufacturer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atari</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nintendo required what from its software developers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">licensed approval</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did licensing lead to regarding games?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">higher quality</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Atari Games created a line of NES products under the name Tengen and took a different approach.

However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo's Donkey Kong game. This violation of Atari's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari.

The 10NES lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck, deterring the copying or production of NES games which had not first achieved Nintendo's licensed approval. The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bore pictures of a very close representation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game, which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own. Symbols on the launch games' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game, in order to reduce consumer confusion. A 'seal of quality' was printed on all appropriately licensed game and accessory packaging.

Nintendo's intention, however, was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself. Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year. A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25% of publishers' requests for cartridges. This was an average figure, with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none. GameSpy noted that Nintendo's &quot;iron-clad terms&quot; made the company many enemies during the 1980s. Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami's Ultra Games label; others tried circumventing the 10NES chip.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Sega finally permit third-party publishing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">summer 1988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the 1st company Sega permitted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mediagenic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nintendo was the sole manufacturer of what component for third-party developers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cartridges</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As cartridges couldn't be returned to Nintendo, the developers took on the entirety of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">risk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was there a shortage of DRAM and ROM chips?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1988 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does ZIF stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">zero insertion force</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The ZIF insertion used by Nintendo was set to emulate what device?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">VCR</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The force of pushing in the cartridge did what to the device over eventual use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bent the contact pins slightly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material were the connector springs made of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nickel </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material comprised the game cartridge connectors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">copper </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In response to these hardware flaws, &quot;Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers&quot; sprang up across the U.S. According to Nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired.
