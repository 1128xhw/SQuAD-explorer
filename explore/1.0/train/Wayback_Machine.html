Prior to the trial proceedings, EchoStar indicated that it intended to offer Wayback Machine snapshots as proof of the past content of Telewizja Polska's web site. Telewizja Polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source, but Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys rejected Telewizja Polska's assertion of hearsay and denied TVP's motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial. At the trial, however, district Court Judge Ronald Guzman, the trial judge, overruled Magistrate Keys' findings,[citation needed] and held that neither the affidavit of the Internet Archive employee nor the underlying pages (i.e., the Telewizja Polska website) were admissible as evidence. Judge Guzman reasoned that the employee's affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements, and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Telewizja Polska operate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">TVP Polonia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is EchoStar's platform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dish Network</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which judge denied Telewizja Polska's attempt to block the use of Internet Archive contents as evidence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which judge overturned Keys' ruling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">district Court Judge Ronald Guzman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Provided some additional requirements are met (e.g. providing an authoritative statement of the archivist), the United States patent office and the European Patent Office will accept date stamps from the Internet Archive as evidence of when a given Web page was accessible to the public.

The plaintiff, Healthcare Advocates, then amended their complaint to include the Internet Archive, accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Healthcare Advocates claimed that, since they had installed a robots.txt file on their web site, even if after the initial lawsuit was filed, the Archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff web site from the Wayback Machine. The lawsuit was settled out of court.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which law firm leveraged Wayback Machine to protect their client in 2003?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harding Earley Follmer &amp; Frailey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company filed suit against Harding, Earley, Follmer &amp; Frailey's client?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Healthcare Advocates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Healthcare advocates change their case to include as a defendant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Internet Archive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What laws did Healthcare Advocates accuse Internet Archive of having broken?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Robots.txt is used as part of the Robots Exclusion Standard, a voluntary protocol the Internet Archive respects that disallows bots from indexing certain pages delineated by its creator as off-limits. As a result, the Internet Archive has rendered unavailable a number of web sites that now are inaccessible through the Wayback Machine. Currently, the Internet Archive applies robots.txt rules retroactively; if a site blocks the Internet Archive, such as Healthcare Advocates, any previously archived pages from the domain are rendered unavailable as well.

Internet Archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on January 20, 2006, seeking a judicial determination that Internet Archive did not violate Shell's copyright. Shell responded and brought a countersuit against Internet Archive for archiving her site, which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service. On February 13, 2007, a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract. The Internet Archive did not move to dismiss copyright infringement claims Shell asserted arising out of its copying activities, which would also go forward.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sued Internet Archive in 2005?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Suzanne Shell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the URL owned by Suzanne Shell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">profane-justice.org</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what jurisdiction were Internet Archive's counterclaims filed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Northern District of California</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what jurisdiction where counterclaims nullified by the court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">District of Colorado</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On April 25, 2007, Internet Archive and Suzanne Shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit.
