Jesus was stripped of his clothing and offered wine mixed with gall to drink, before being crucified. He was then hung for six hours (according to Mark's Gospel) between two convicted thieves. During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews&quot; in three languages. They then divided his garments among them, but cast lots for his seamless robe. After Jesus' death they pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died. The Bible records seven statements that Jesus made while he was on the cross, as well as several supernatural events that occurred.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the person that tried Jesus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pontius Pilate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was Jesus hung for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six hours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the sign say on top of Jesus' cross?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was done to make sure Jesus was dead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they pierced his side with a spear</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many statements did Jesus make on the cross?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven statements</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are considered to be two historically certain facts about Jesus.

Bart Ehrman states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of Pontius Pilate is the most certain element about him. John Dominic Crossan states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be. Eddy and Boyd state that it is now &quot;firmly established&quot; that there is non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus. Craig Blomberg states that most scholars in the third quest for the historical Jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable. Christopher M.

The crucified man was identified as Yehohanan ben Hagkol and probably died about 70 AD, around the time of the Jewish revolt against Rome. The analyses at the Hadassah Medical School estimated that he died in his late 20s. Another relevant archaeological find, which also dates to the 1st century AD, is an unidentified heel bone with a spike discovered in a Jerusalem gravesite, now held by the Israel Antiquities Authority and displayed in the Israel Museum.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are all sources of the crucification literary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">almost all ancient sources relating to crucifixion are literary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What evidence was found that Crucifixion did happen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1968 archeological discovery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the crucified man discovered in an archaeological find?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ben Hagkol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Ben Hagkol crucified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> about 70 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What institution holds a heel bone with a spike inserted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Israel Museum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The earliest detailed accounts of the death of Jesus are contained in the four canonical gospels.

In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative.

Matthew's and Mark's Gospels record that he refused this. He was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves. According to some translations from the original Greek, the thieves may have been bandits or Jewish rebels. According to Mark's Gospel, he endured the torment of crucifixion for some six hours from the third hour, at approximately 9 am, until his death at the ninth hour, corresponding to about 3 pm. The soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews&quot; in three languages, divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe. The Roman soldiers did not break Jesus' legs, as they did to the other two men crucified (breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process), as Jesus was dead already. Each gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, seven statements altogether. In the Synoptic Gospels, various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion, including darkness, an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection of saints. Following Jesus' death, his body was removed from the cross by Joseph of Arimathea and buried in a rock-hewn tomb, with Nicodemus assisting.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Jesus offered to drink after his arrest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wine mixed with gall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Jesus Crucified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hung between two convicted thieves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many hours did Jesus endure Crucifixion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six hours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many accounts are there of Jesus' last words?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven statements altogether</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who removed Jesus from the cross?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joseph of Arimathea</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are several details that are only found in one of the gospel accounts.

The Gospel of Luke's unique contributions to the narrative include Jesus' words to the women who were mourning, one criminal's rebuke of the other, the reaction of the multitudes who left &quot;beating their breasts&quot;, and the women preparing spices and ointments before resting on the Sabbath.

Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday, not Friday, on the grounds of the mention of &quot;three days and three nights&quot; in Matthew before his resurrection, celebrated on Sunday. Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a &quot;day and night&quot; may refer to any part of a 24-hour period, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What day is presumed the Crucifixion happened?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Friday</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do some scholars propose a Thursday is possible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a &quot;double sabbath&quot; caused by an extra Passover sabbath</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do some other scholars argue that it happened on a Wednesday?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on the grounds of the mention of &quot;three days and three nights&quot; in Matthew</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was Jesus said to be in the tomb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three days and three nights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was Jesus in the tomb exactly 72 hours?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Mark 15:25 crucifixion takes place at the third hour (9 a.m.) and Jesus' death at the ninth hour (3 p.m.).

Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery (which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites).

In the Western Church, before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other. Nails are almost always depicted in art, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross.

In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Philippians 2:8) died &quot;at the right time&quot; (Romans 4:25) based on the plan of God. For Paul the &quot;power of the cross&quot; is not separable from the Resurrection of Jesus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's Christology focuses on the death and Resurrection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul's Christology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the crucifixion related to the resurrection per Paul?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> directly related</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term does Paul use for the Gospels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the cross of Christ</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Paul claims the Resurrection was needed for what reason?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">based on the plan of God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Paul view the Resurrection of Jesus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">power of the cross</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John Calvin supported the &quot;agent of God&quot; Christology and argued that in his trial in Pilate's Court Jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father. This Christological theme continued into the 20th century, both in the Eastern and Western Churches. In the Eastern Church Sergei Bulgakov argued that the crucifixion of Jesus was &quot;pre-eternally&quot; determined by the Father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam. In the Western Church, Karl Rahner elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God (and the water from the side of Jesus) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Calvin claim Jesus could have done?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">successfully argued for his innocence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Jesus submit to crucifixion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">obedience to the Father</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Eastern Church believes what regarding the death and ressurection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;pre-eternally&quot; determined by the Father</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Jesus's death accomplish per the Eastern Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the blood of the lamb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jesus' death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Jesus' death and Resurrection support?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">how salvation is granted to humanity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How important is Jesus' death to modern theology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">central importance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did Jesus sacrifice himself without fighting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jesus willingly sacrificed himself</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Jesus sacrifice himself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an act of perfect obedience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What church is the sacrifice important to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Roman Catholic church</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The presence of the Virgin Mary under the cross[Jn. 19:26-27] has in itself been the subject of Marian art, and well known Catholic symbolism such as the Miraculous Medal and Pope John Paul II's Coat of Arms bearing a Marian Cross.
