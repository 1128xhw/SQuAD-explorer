The imperial clouds wavering over Somalia alarmed the Dervish leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, who gathered Somali soldiers from across the Horn of Africa and began one of the longest anti-colonial wars ever. The Dervish State successfully repulsed the British empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region. As a result of its successes against the British, the Dervish State received support from the Ottoman and German empires. The Turks also named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation, and the Germans promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire. After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920, when Britain for the first time in Africa used airplanes to bomb the Dervish capital of Taleex. As a result of this bombardment, former Dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of Britain. Italy similarly faced the same opposition from Somali Sultans and armies and did not acquire full control of parts of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late 1927.

These were advantages that British Somaliland, which was to be incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties when it came time to integrate the two parts. Meanwhile, in 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British &quot;returned&quot; the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against plundering by Somali clans. Britain included the proviso that the Somali nomads would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over them. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District (NFD) to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Haud, what area of Somalia was given to Ethiopia by the British?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ogaden</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the British give the Haud to Ethiopia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1948</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Ogaden was given to Ethiopia on the basis of a treaty signed by the British with what Ethiopian leader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emperor Menelik</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Britain try to purchase Somali lands from Ethiopia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1956 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What people constituted almost the entire population of the Northern Frontier District?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Somali</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A referendum was held in neighboring Djibouti (then known as French Somaliland) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls. The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later. Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977, and Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as Djibouti's first president (1977–1991).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Djibouti called in 1958?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French Somaliland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Somalia become independent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Mahmoud Harbi's title?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vice President of the Government Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Djibouti achieve independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1977</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first president of Djibouti?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hassan Gouled Aptidon</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later.

After haplogroup E1b1b, the second most frequently occurring Y-DNA haplogroup among Somalis is the West Asian haplogroup T (M70). It is observed in slightly more than 10% of Somali males.

This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the Maghreb and the other moving south into the Horn.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Hodgson publish his DNA study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Hodgson, what ancestral people spread the Afro-Asiatic languages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ethio-Somali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Hodgson, what people is mostly descended from Ethio-Somalis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Somalis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Hodgson, how long ago did the Ethio-Somalis diverge from other non-African ancestries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at least 23,000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Hodgson, where did the Ethio-Somalis originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Near East</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The analysis of HLA antigens has also helped clarify the possible background of the Somali people, as the distribution of haplotype frequencies vary among population groups.

Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (midho), songwriters (lahan) and singers ('odka or &quot;voice&quot;).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What scale is used by most Somali songs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pentatonic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many notes are in a hepatonic scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an exaple of a hepatonic scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the major scale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Arabia and Ethiopia, what land has songs that sound similar to those of Somalia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sudan </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does midho mean in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lyricists </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Growing out of the Somali people's rich storytelling tradition, the first few feature-length Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s, immediately after independence. Following the creation of the Somali Film Agency (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. The Somali filmmaker Ali Said Hassan concurrently served as the SFA's representative in Rome. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as riwaayado were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry. Epic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of video technology and national television networks. Said Salah Ahmed during this period directed his first feature film, The Somali Darwish (The Somalia Dervishes), devoted to the Dervish State. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are at the forefront of this quiet revolution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade were the first Somali feature films made?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the SFA founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1975</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the representative of the Somali Film Agency in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ali Said Hassan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are riwaaydo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">popular musicals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Said Salah Ahmed's first feature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Somali Darwish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Somali art is the artistic culture of the Somali people, both historic and contemporary.
