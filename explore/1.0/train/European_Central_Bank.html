It is one of the world's most important central banks and is one of the seven institutions of the European Union (EU) listed in the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The capital stock of the bank is owned by the central banks of all 28 EU member states.[dated info] The Treaty of Amsterdam established the bank in 1998, and it is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. As of 2015[update] the President of the ECB is Mario Draghi, former governor of the Bank of Italy, former member of the World Bank, and former managing director of the Goldman Sachs international division (2002–2005).

The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany, its president should be French. This was opposed by the German, Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro.

This so-called European debt crisis began after Greece's new elected government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit and openly communicated the imminent danger of a Greek sovereign default. Seeing a sovereign default in the eurozone as a shock, the general public, international and European institutions, and the financial community started to intensively reassess the economic situation and creditworthiness of eurozone states. Those eurozone states being assessed as not financially sustainable enough on their current path, faced waves of credit rating downgrades and rising borrowing costs including increasing interest rate spreads. As a consequence, the ability of these states to borrow new money to further finance their budget deficits or to refinance existing unsustainable debt levels was strongly reduced.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the European debt Crisis begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the eurozone states that were thought to not be able to repay their debt face as a consequence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ability of these states to borrow new money to further finance their budget deficits or to refinance existing unsustainable debt levels was strongly reduced</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country was the first to be at risk for soverign default?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greece</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who brought Greece's financial crisis to the forefront?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new elected government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had Greece's previous government been hiding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its true indebtedness and budget deficit</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is also a widespread view[vague][who?] that giving much more financial support to continuously cover the debt crisis or allow even higher budget deficits or debt levels would discourage the crisis states to implement necessary reforms to regain their competitiveness.[citation needed] There has also been a reluctance[citation needed] of financially stable eurozone states like Germany[citation needed] to further circumvent the no-bailout clause in the EU contracts and to generally take on the burden of financing or guaranteeing the debts of financially unstable or defaulting eurozone countries.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries didn't want to go around the bail-out clause and have to shoulder the burden of backing the defaulters debts.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">financially stable eurozone states like Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do most see raising the debt celing as doing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">discourage the crisis states to implement necessary reforms to regain their competitiveness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could keep the crisis states from trying to stand on their own?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">giving much more financial support to continuously cover the debt crisis or allow even higher budget deficits or debt levels</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This has led to public discussions if Greece, Portugal, and even Italy would be better off leaving the eurozone to regain economical and financial stability if they would not implement reforms to strengthen their competitiveness as part of the eurozone in time.
