Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km2, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is two islands that are part of the British Isles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Britain, Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the British Isles located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Atlantic,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people live in the British Isles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">just under 70 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the three Crown Dependencies of the British Isles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Isle of Man</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the Channel Islands</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland, Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 million years old. During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass. The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,344 metres (4,409 ft), and Lough Neagh, which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers 390 square kilometres (151 sq mi). The climate is temperate marine, with mild winters and warm summers. The North Atlantic Drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C (20 °F) above the global average for the latitude. This led to a landscape which was long dominated by temperate rainforest, although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover. The region was re-inhabited after the last glacial period of Quaternary glaciation, by 12,000 BC when Great Britain was still a peninsula of the European continent. Ireland, which became an island by 12,000 BC, was not inhabited until after 8000 BC. Great Britain became an island by 5600 BC.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the age of the oldest rocks in the north western part of Scotland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2,700 million years old</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the elevation of Ben Nevis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,344 metres (4,409 ft</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of climate does this area have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">temperate marine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around 12,000 BC, Great Britain was still a peninsula on what continent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European continent.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is it believed that Ireland became inhabited?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">after 8000 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hiberni (Ireland), Pictish (northern Britain) and Britons (southern Britain) tribes, all speaking Insular Celtic, inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was conquered by the Roman Empire from AD 43. The first Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England. Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change—particularly in England. The subsequent Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919–1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as Northern Ireland.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which is one of the tribes that spoke Insular Celtic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pictish (northern Britain)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Pictish tribe start to inhabit the islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">beginning of the 1st millennium AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who foreign group conquered Britain around AD 43?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Vikings invade Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the six counties in Ireland called that are still part of the United Kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Northern Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The term British Isles is controversial in Ireland, where there are objections to its usage due to the association of the word British with Ireland.

In the 1st century BC, Diodorus Siculus has Prettanikē nēsos, &quot;the British Island&quot;, and Prettanoi, &quot;the Britons&quot;. Strabo used Βρεττανική (Brettanike), and Marcian of Heraclea, in his Periplus maris exteri, used αἱ Πρεττανικαί νῆσοι (the Prettanic Isles) to refer to the islands. Historians today, though not in absolute agreement, largely agree that these Greek and Latin names were probably drawn from native Celtic-language names for the archipelago. Along these lines, the inhabitants of the islands were called the Πρεττανοί (Priteni or Pretani). The shift from the &quot;P&quot; of Pretannia to the &quot;B&quot; of Britannia by the Romans occurred during the time of Julius Caesar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the first known occurrence of the British Isle name appear in written material?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">writings of sea-farers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the earliest surviving records that mention the name British Isles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Massaliote Periplus (6th century BC)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the &quot;P&quot; sound of Pretannia change to the &quot;B&quot; sound of Britannia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">during the time of Julius Caesar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language do most historians agree upon where the Greek names for the British Isles came from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">native Celtic-language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the ancient Greeks call the people that lived in the British Isles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Πρεττανοί (Priteni or Pretani)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Greco-Egyptian scientist Claudius Ptolemy referred to the larger island as great Britain (μεγάλης Βρεττανίας - megális Brettanias) and to Ireland as little Britain (μικρής Βρεττανίας - mikris Brettanias) in his work Almagest (147–148 AD). In his later work, Geography (c. 150 AD), he gave these islands the names Alwion, Iwernia, and Mona (the Isle of Man), suggesting these may have been names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing Almagest.

Baltica formed roughly the northwestern half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the Variscan orogeny in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, forming the hills of Munster, southwest England, and southern Wales.

By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there.

This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in the north of what is now England, in Cornwall and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, having been Christianised, traditionally by the Romano-Briton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as the Dark Ages, Ireland entered a golden age and responded with missions (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities.

Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford. England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of Denmark. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in Normandy, in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day. A century later the marriage of the future Henry II of England to Eleanor of Aquitaine created the Angevin Empire, partially under the French Crown. At the invitation of a provincial king and under the authority of Pope Adrian IV (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the Angevins invaded Ireland in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of the Irish High King to ensure the terms of the Treaty of Windsor led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of Lord of Ireland.

A similar situation existed in the Principality of Wales, which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England as from being vassal of the King of France. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as &quot;the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England&quot;, thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church.

In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which crown did the King of Scotland inherit in 1603?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Crown of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the King of England have issues with parliment in the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Britain during the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">political upheaval, religious division and war</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who where the ruling class after the revolutionary republic was created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestant and British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The English Civil War brought about what change to Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">revolutionary republic in England</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Kingdoms of England and Scotland were unified in 1707 creating the Kingdom of Great Britain.

The British monarch is the head of state for all parts of the isles except for the Republic of Ireland, where the head of state is the President of Ireland.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which state send members to the parliament in Edinburgh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scotland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of government does the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parliamentary democracies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who shares power in Northern Ireland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unionists and nationalists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Unionists in Northern Ireland want to remain part of which country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nationalist in Northern Ireland want to join which country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the rest of Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ireland and the United Kingdom are both part of the European Union (EU).

A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is association football. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. Rugby union is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The British and Irish Lions is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the southern hemisphere rugby playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the Triple Crown as part of the Six Nations Championship.

Either tunnel, at 50 mi (80 km), would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated £15 billion or €20 billion.
