Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975–1985, which showed a rate of −5.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004.

The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Doña Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What major public central park is located south of Avenida Italia? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parque Batlle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many former districts does the current barrio of Parque Battle include? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sub district of Parque Batlle took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell Y Rius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Villa Dolores</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Parque Batlle is named in honour of José Batlle y Ordóñez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ordóñez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010[update], the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the &quot;lung&quot; of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Parque Batlle is named in honor of who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> José Batlle y Ordóñez</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jose Batile y Ordonez was president of where? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uruguay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between what years was Jose batlle y Ordonez president of Uruguay? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1911 to 1915</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Parque Batlle was originally proposed by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an Act of March 1907</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Parque Rodó is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas.

This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does DNT stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Dirección Nacional de Transporte</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dirección Nacional de Transporte</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Tres Cruces Bus Terminal located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San José and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Peñarol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the AFE stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The State Railways Administration of Uruguay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What neighborhood is the General Artigas Central Station located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aguada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the General Artigas Central Station abandoned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1 March 2003</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires. The main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, physical changes have ceased, and since that time the area has degraded due to national economic stagnation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What gives natural protection to ships in Montevideo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The port on Montevideo Bay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between what years did the main engineering work on the port of Montevideo Bay take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870 and 1930</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened in 1923 that required repairs to many of the city's engineering works?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A major storm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaraní and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of José Toribio (son of Tomás Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaraní street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaraní and 25 de Mayo) and Julián Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Estévez in 1798.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hospital Maciel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who originally donated the land for Hospital Macie?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Francisco Antonio Maciel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first building of the Hospital Maciel established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> between 1781 and 1788</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hospital Vilardebó is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardebó Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hospital Vilardebó</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Hospital Vilardebo named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teodoro Vilardebó Matuliche</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Hospital Vilardebo open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21 May 1880</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many inpatients did the the Hospital Vilardebo have in 1915?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,500 inpatients</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
