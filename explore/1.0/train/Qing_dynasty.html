In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing Jurchen clans into &quot;Banners&quot;, military-social units. Nurhaci formed these clans into a unified entity, the subjects of which became known collectively as the Manchu people. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital Beijing. Rather than serve them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and seized Beijing. The conquest of China proper was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Central Asia. While the early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their official title was Emperor they were known as khans to the Mongols and patronized Tibetan Buddhism, they governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government. They retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in international relations, and in places such as Taiwan, the Qing so-called internal foreign policy closely resembled colonial policy and control.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who started the Manchun dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did this dynasty form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchuria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name a peasant rebel leader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Li Zicheng</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the ming capital?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beijing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What pass was opened to the Banner Armies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shanhai Pass</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1735–1796) saw the apogee and initial decline in prosperity and imperial control. The population rose to some 400 million, but taxes and government revenues were fixed at a low rate, virtually guaranteeing eventual fiscal crisis. Corruption set in, rebels tested government legitimacy, and ruling elites did not change their mindsets in the face of changes in the world system. Following the Opium War, European powers imposed unequal treaties, free trade, extraterritoriality and treaty ports under foreign control. The Taiping Rebellion (1850–64) and Dungan Revolt (1862–77) in Central Asia led to the deaths of some 20 million people. In spite of these disasters, in the Tongzhi Restoration of the 1860s, Han Chinese elites rallied to the defense of the Confucian order and the Qing rulers. The initial gains in the Self-Strengthening Movement were destroyed in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895, in which the Qing lost its influence over Korea and the possession of Taiwan. New Armies were organized, but the ambitious Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 was turned back by Empress Dowager Cixi, a ruthless but capable leader. When, in response to the violently anti-foreign Yihetuan (&quot;Boxers&quot;), foreign powers invaded China, the Empress Dowager declared war on them, leading to defeat and the flight of the Imperial Court to Xi'an.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did the Qianlong Emperor rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">(1735–1796)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Taiping rebellion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">(1850–64) </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Dungan Revolt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> (1862–77)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people died during the Taiping Rebellion and the Dungan Revolt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 million people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first Sino-Japanese War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1895</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After agreeing to sign the Boxer Protocol the government then initiated unprecedented fiscal and administrative reforms, including elections, a new legal code, and abolition of the examination system.

His son Hong Taiji renamed the dynasty Great Qing in 1636. There are competing explanations on the meaning of Qīng (lit. &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;pure&quot;). The name may have been selected in reaction to the name of the Ming dynasty (明), which consists of the Chinese characters for &quot;sun&quot; (日) and &quot;moon&quot; (月), both associated with the fire element of the Chinese zodiacal system. The character Qīng (清) is composed of &quot;water&quot; (氵) and &quot;azure&quot; (青), both associated with the water element. This association would justify the Qing conquest as defeat of fire by water. The water imagery of the new name may also have had Buddhist overtones of perspicacity and enlightenment and connections with the Bodhisattva Manjusri. The Manchu name daicing, which sounds like a phonetic rendering of Dà Qīng or Dai Ching, may in fact have been derived from a Mongolian word that means &quot;warrior&quot;. Daicing gurun may therefore have meant &quot;warrior state&quot;, a pun that was only intelligible to Manchu and Mongol people. In the later part of the dynasty, however, even the Manchus themselves had forgotten this possible meaning.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who named himself the Bright Khan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nurhaci </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What imagery is suggested in the Chinese characters of the dynasties new name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">water imagery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who renamed the Qing dynasty in 1363?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hong Taiji </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language did the dynasties name come from originall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mongolian </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Mongolian word did Qing dynasty get it's name from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mongolian word that means &quot;warrior&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After conquering &quot;China proper&quot;, the Manchus identified their state as &quot;China&quot; (中國, Zhōngguó; &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means &quot;central&quot; or &quot;middle,&quot; gurun means &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;state&quot;).

The Manchus are sometimes mistaken for a nomadic people, which they were not. What was to become the Manchu state was founded by Nurhaci, the chieftain of a minor Jurchen tribe – the Aisin Gioro – in Jianzhou in the early 17th century. Originally a vassal of the Ming emperors, Nurhachi embarked on an intertribal feud in 1582 that escalated into a campaign to unify the nearby tribes. By 1616, he had sufficiently consolidated Jianzhou so as to be able to proclaim himself Khan of the Great Jin in reference to the previous Jurchen dynasty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ethnic group make up the most people in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Han Chinese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Qing dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jurchen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of lifestyle did the Jurchen live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sedentary farming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What parts of China did they come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jilin and Heilongjiang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were the Manchu's nomadic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">farming people</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Relocating his court from Jianzhou to Liaodong provided Nurhachi access to more resources; it also brought him in close contact with the Khorchin Mongol domains on the plains of Mongolia.

The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen &quot;nation&quot; as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who included newly conquered Ming officials in his government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hong Taiji</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did a Han revolt occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1623</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did a Han revolt occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liaodong </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What proportion of bannerman were Manchu by 1648?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one-sixth</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643 without a designated heir.

Choosing Beijing as the capital had not been a straightforward decision, since no major Chinese dynasty had directly taken over its immediate predecessor's capital.

The popular description of the order was: &quot;To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.&quot; To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that &quot;a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.&quot; Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it in the form of a top-knot. The order triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in Jiangnan and massive killing of ethnic Han Chinese. It was Han Chinese defectors who carried out massacres against people refusing to wear the queue.. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. At the end of the third massacre, there was hardly any living person left in this city. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Han Chinese Qing army led by the Han Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐), who had been ordered to &quot;fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your swords,&quot; massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. The queue was the only aspect of Manchu culture which the Qing forced on the common Han population. The Qing required people serving as officials to wear Manchu clothing, but allowed non-official Han civilians to continue wearing Hanfu (Han clothing).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Dorgon declare in July of 1645?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;haircutting order&quot;) </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the peoples description of the haircutting order?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Ming's typically wear their hair&gt;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">top-knot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city was massacred for not wearing the proper haircut?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jiading </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although his support had been essential to Shunzhi's ascent, Dorgon had through the years centralised so much power in his hands as to become a direct threat to the throne.

Two months into Shunzhi's personal rule, Dorgon was not only stripped of his titles, but his corpse was disinterred and mutilated.[b] to atone for multiple &quot;crimes&quot;, one of which was persecuting to death Shunzhi’s agnate eldest brother, Hooge. More importantly, Dorgon's symbolic fall from grace also signaled a political purge of his family and associates at court, thus reverting power back to the person of the emperor. After a promising start, Shunzhi's reign was cut short by his early death in 1661 at the age of twenty-four from smallpox.

Kangxi's long reign started when he was eight years old upon the untimely demise of his father. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon's dictatorial monopolizing of power during the regency, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed, hastily appointed four senior cabinet ministers to govern on behalf of his young son. The four ministers — Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha, and Oboi — were chosen for their long service, but also to counteract each other's influences. Most important, the four were not closely related to the imperial family and laid no claim to the throne. However, as time passed, through chance and machination, Oboi, the most junior of the four, achieved such political dominance as to be a potential threat. Even though Oboi's loyalty was never an issue, his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him into an escalating conflict with the young emperor. In 1669 Kangxi, through trickery, disarmed and imprisoned Oboi — a significant victory for a fifteen-year-old emperor over a wily politician and experienced commander.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was Kangxi Emperor in power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sixty-one year</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What era did Kanxi's rule kick off?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">High Qing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had the longest rule of any emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kangxi </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Kangxi when he took over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruled while Kangxi was young?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oboi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The early Manchu rulers also established two foundations of legitimacy which help to explain the stability of their dynasty. The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture which they adopted from earlier dynasties. Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar-official elites gradually came to terms with each other. The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials. Imperial patronage of Kangxi Dictionary demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values. The second major source of stability was the Central Asian aspect of their Manchu identity which allowed them to appeal to Mongol, Tibetan and Uighur constituents. The Qing used the title of Emperor (Huangdi) in Chinese while among Mongols the Qing monarch was referred to as Bogda khan (wise Khan), and referred to as Gong Ma in Tibet. Qianlong propagated the image of himself as Buddhist sage rulers, patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. In the Manchu language, the Qing monarch was alternately referred to as either Huwangdi (Emperor) or Khan with no special distinction between the two usages. The Kangxi Emperor also welcomed to his court Jesuit missionaries, who had first come to China under the Ming. Missionaries including Tomás Pereira, Martino Martini, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, Ferdinand Verbiest and Antoine Thomas held significant positions as military weapons experts, mathematicians, cartographers, astronomers and advisers to the emperor.

The ensuing Revolt of the Three Feudatories lasted for eight years. Wu attempted, ultimately in vain, to fire the embers of south China Ming loyalty by restoring Ming customs, ordering that the resented queues be cut, and declaring himself emperor of a new dynasty. At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China which took several decades to recover. Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by Kangxi, leading him to task Generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard Soldiers to crush the rebels. The Qing thought that Han Chinese were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen. Similarly, in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals such as Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as the primary military forces. This choice was due to the rocky terrain, which favoured infantry troops over cavalry, to the desire to keep Bannermen in the reserves, and, again, to the belief that Han troops were better at fighting other Han people. These Han generals achieved victory over the rebels. Also due to the mountainous terrain, Sichuan and southern Shaanxi were also retaken by the Han Chinese Green Standard Army under Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong in 1680, with Manchus only participating in dealing with logistics and provisions. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. 213 Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing during the revolt. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories besides 200,000 Bannermen.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the Revolt of the Three Feudatories last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> eight years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who declared himself emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wu </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Qing regain power over southern China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1681</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Qing think were the better soldiers to battle Han Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">other Han people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Green Standard Army soldiers  were on the Qing side?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Qing forces were crushed by Wu from 1673-1674.

The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title &quot;Duke Haicheng&quot; (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin.

In the later years of Kangxi's reign, Yongzheng and his brothers had fought, and there were rumours that he had usurped the throne(most of the rumours believe that Yongzheng's brother Yingzhen (Kangxi's 14th son) is the real successor of Kangxi Emperor, the reason why Yingzhen failed to sit on the throne is because Yongzheng and his confidant Keduo Long tampered the content of Kangxi's testament at the night when Kangxi passed away), a charge for which there is little evidence. In fact, his father had trusted him with delicate political issues and discussed state policy with him. When Yongzheng came to power at the age of 45, he felt a sense of urgency about the problems which had accumulated in his father's later years and did not need instruction in how to exercise power. In the words of one recent historian, he was &quot;severe, suspicious, and jealous, but extremely capable and resourceful,&quot; and in the words of another, turned out to be an &quot;early modern state-maker of the first order.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Kangxi die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1722</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took Kangxi's place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Yong </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Yongzheng when he took over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">45</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>He moved rapidly.

In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for &quot;money to nourish honesty&quot; among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence. The fiscal crisis persisted.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Yongzheng behead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-Manchu writer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did Yongzheng ban?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Yongzheng crack down on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">collection of the land tax</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Yongzheng ban christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1723 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1725 Yongzheng bestowed the hereditary title of Marquis on a descendant of the Ming dynasty Imperial family, Zhu Zhiliang, who received a salary from the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the Ming tombs, and was also inducted the Chinese Plain White Banner in the Eight Banners.

Soon all available farmland was used up, forcing peasants to work ever-smaller and more intensely worked plots. The Qianlong Emperor once bemoaned the country's situation by remarking &quot;The population continues to grow, but the land does not.&quot; The only remaining part of the empire that had arable farmland was Manchuria, where the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang had been walled off as a Manchu homeland. The emperor decreed for the first time that Han Chinese civilians were forbidden to settle. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What crops helped the Chinese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">potato and peanut</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What led to overpopulation in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prosperity and internal stability</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people lived in China at the start of the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people lived in China at the end of the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">300 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the last part of China with farmland left?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchuria</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However Qing rule saw an massively increasing amount of Han Chinese both illegally and legally streaming into Manchuria and settling down to cultivate land as Manchu landlords desired Han Chinese peasants to rent on their land and grow grain, most Han Chinese migrants were not evicted as they went over the Great Wall and Willow Palisade, during the eighteenth century Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares of privately owned land in Manchuria and 203,583 hectares of lands which were part of coutrier stations, noble estates, and Banner lands, in garrisons and towns in Manchuria Han Chinese made up 80% of the population.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Hans go to to find land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchuria </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much land did the Han cultivate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">500,000 hectares</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of the population in Manchuria was Han?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Han Chinese farmers were resettled from north China by the Qing to the area along the Liao River in order to restore the land to cultivation.

Qianlong allowed Han Chinese peasants suffering from drought to move into Manchuria despite him issuing edicts in favor of banning them from 1740–1776. Chinese tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the &quot;imperial estates&quot; and Manchu Bannerlands in the area. Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, the path linking Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling, Changchun, Hulun, and Ningguta was settled by Han Chinese during the Qianlong Emperor's rule, and Han Chinese were the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800. To increase the Imperial Treasury's revenue, the Qing sold formerly Manchu only lands along the Sungari to Han Chinese at the beginning of the Daoguang Emperor's reign, and Han Chinese filled up most of Manchuria's towns by the 1840s according to Abbe Huc.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were starving Han sent by the Qing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchuria and Inner Mongolia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much land did the Han farm in Inner Mongolia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tens of thousands of hectares</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other types of land were the Han allowed to farm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;imperial estates&quot; and Manchu Bannerlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the emperor in the later half of the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qianlong </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ethnicity was the majority in urban Manchuria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Han Chinese</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, the 18th century saw the European empires gradually expand across the world, as European states developed economies built on maritime trade.

The Qing response, successful for a time, was in 1756 to establish the Canton System, which restricted maritime trade to that city and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants.

In the late 1700s, the governments of Britain and France were deeply concerned about the imbalance of trade and the drain of silver. To meet the growing Chinese demand for opium, the British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal. Since China's economy was essentially self-sufficient, the country had little need to import goods or raw materials from the Europeans, so the usual way of payment was through silver. The Daoguang Emperor, concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects, ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade. Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839, leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What products from China did Europeans want?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silk, tea, and ceramics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Chinese want in return?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silver </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the British and French concerned about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">imbalance of trade and the drain of silver</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else did the Chinese want from the British?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was opium made?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bengal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The First Opium War revealed the outdated state of the Chinese military.

This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as &quot;The Royal Cabinet&quot; because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began &quot;separating&quot; from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia.

The department's original purpose was to manage the internal affairs of the imperial family and the activities of the inner palace (in which tasks it largely replaced eunuchs), but it also played an important role in Qing relations with Tibet and Mongolia, engaged in trading activities (jade, ginseng, salt, furs, etc.), managed textile factories in the Jiangnan region, and even published books. Relations with the Salt Superintendents and salt merchants, such as those at Yangzhou, were particularly lucrative, especially since they were direct, and did not go through absorptive layers of bureaucracy. The department was manned by booi,[o] or &quot;bondservants,&quot; from the Upper Three Banners.

Each province was administered by a governor (巡撫, xunfu) and a provincial military commander (提督, tidu). Below the province were prefectures (府, fu) operating under a prefect (知府, zhīfǔ), followed by subprefectures under a subprefect. The lowest unit was the county, overseen by a county magistrate. The eighteen provinces are also known as &quot;China proper&quot;. The position of viceroy or governor-general (總督, zongdu) was the highest rank in the provincial administration.

Qinghai was also put under direct control of the Qing court. Xinjiang, also known as Chinese Turkestan, was subdivided into the regions north and south of the Tian Shan mountains, also known today as Dzungaria and Tarim Basin respectively, but the post of Ili General was established in 1762 to exercise unified military and administrative jurisdiction over both regions. Dzungaria was fully opened to Han migration by the Qianlong Emperor from the beginning. Han migrants were at first forbidden from permanently settling in the Tarim Basin but were the ban was lifted after the invasion by Jahangir Khoja in the 1820s. Likewise, Manchuria was also governed by military generals until its division into provinces, though some areas of Xinjiang and Northeast China were lost to the Russian Empire in the mid-19th century. Manchuria was originally separated from China proper by the Inner Willow Palisade, a ditch and embankment planted with willows intended to restrict the movement of the Han Chinese, as the area was off-limits to civilian Han Chinese until the government started colonizing the area, especially since the 1860s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Tibet become part of Qing China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main government entity that ran the territories like Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lifan Yuan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Chinese Turkestan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xinjiang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which emperor allowed Han migration to Dzungaria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qianlong </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first ran Manchuria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military generals </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With respect to these outer regions, the Qing maintained imperial control, with the emperor acting as Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism and protector of Muslims. However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930. In early 20th century, Britain sent an expedition force to Tibet and forced Tibetans to sign a treaty. The Qing court responded by asserting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet, resulting in the 1906 Anglo-Chinese Convention signed between Britain and China. The British agreed not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet, while China engaged not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet. Furthermore, similar to Xinjiang which was converted into a province earlier, the Qing government also turned Manchuria into three provinces in the early 20th century, officially known as the &quot;Three Northeast Provinces&quot;, and established the post of Viceroy of the Three Northeast Provinces to oversee these provinces, making the total number of regional viceroys to nine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What title did the emperor hold in Mongolia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">khan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruled Kashgaria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yaqub Beg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supported Beg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the British invade Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early 20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the agreement between Britain and the Chinese that kept the British out of Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1906 Anglo-Chinese Convention</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The early Qing military was rooted in the Eight Banners first developed by Nurhaci to organize Jurchen society beyond petty clan affiliations. There were eight banners in all, differentiated by color. The yellow, bordered yellow, and white banners were known as the &quot;Upper Three Banners&quot; and were under the direct command of the emperor. Only Manchus belonging to the Upper Three Banners, and selected Han Chinese who had passed the highest level of martial exams could serve as the emperor's personal bodyguards. The remaining Banners were known as the &quot;Lower Five Banners.&quot; They were commanded by hereditary Manchu princes descended from Nurhachi's immediate family, known informally as the &quot;Iron cap princes&quot;. Together they formed the ruling council of the Manchu nation as well as high command of the army. Nurhachi's son Hong Taiji expanded the system to include mirrored Mongol and Han Banners. After capturing Beijing in 1644, the relatively small Banner armies were further augmented by the Green Standard Army, made up of those Ming troops who had surrendered to the Qing, which eventually outnumbered Banner troops three to one.

The years leading up to the conquest increased the number of Han Chinese under Manchu rule, leading Hong Taiji to create the Eight Han Banners (zh), and around the time of the Qing takeover of Beijing, their numbers rapidly swelled. Han Bannermen held high status and power in the early Qing period, especially immediately after the conquest during Shunzhi and Kangxi's reign where they dominated Governor-Generalships and Governorships across China at the expense of both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians. Han also numerically dominated the Banners up until the mid 18th century. European visitors in Beijing called them &quot;Tartarized Chinese&quot; or &quot;Tartarified Chinese&quot;. It was in Qianlong's reign that the Qianlong Emperor, concerned about maintaining Manchu identity, re-emphasized Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture in the Eight Banners and started a mass discharge of Han Bannermen from the Eight Banners, either asking them to voluntarily resign from the Banner rolls or striking their names off. This led to a change from Han majority to a Manchu majority within the Banner system, and previous Han Bannermen garrisons in southern China such as at Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen in the purge, which started in 1754. The turnover by Qianlong most heavily impacted Han banner garrisons stationed in the provinces while it less impacted Han Bannermen in Beijing, leaving a larger proportion of remaining Han Bannermen in Beijing than the provinces. Han Bannermen's status was decreased from that point on with Manchu Banners gaining higher status. Han Bannermen numbered 75% in 1648 Shunzhi's reign, 72% in 1723 Yongzheng's reign, but decreased to 43% in 1796 during the first year of Jiaqing's reign, which was after Qianlong's purge. The mass discharge was known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners (zh). Qianlong directed most of his ire at those Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after the Qing passed through the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, deeming their ancestors as traitors to the Ming and therefore untrustworthy, while retaining Han Bannermen who were descended from defectors who joined the Qing before 1644 in Liaodong and marched through Shanhai pass, also known as those who &quot;followed the Dragon through the pass&quot; (從龍入關; cong long ru guan).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were Banner's organized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">long ethnic lines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two ethnicities made up the majority of the Banner Armies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manchu and Mongol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ethnicity dominated the army in the reigns of Shunzhi and Kangxi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Han Bannermen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Manchu ethnicity become important again in the Eight Banners?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qianlong's reign</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Europeans call Han Bannermen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Tartarized Chinese&quot; or &quot;Tartarified Chinese&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Early during the Taiping Rebellion, Qing forces suffered a series of disastrous defeats culminating in the loss of the regional capital city of Nanjing in 1853. Shortly thereafter, a Taiping expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of Tianjin, the imperial heartlands. In desperation the Qing court ordered a Chinese official, Zeng Guofan, to organize regional and village militias into an emergency army called tuanlian. Zeng Guofan's strategy was to rely on local gentry to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the Taiping rebels directly threatened. This new force became known as the Xiang Army, named after the Hunan region where it was raised. The Xiang Army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army. It was given professional training, but was paid for out of regional coffers and funds its commanders — mostly members of the Chinese gentry — could muster. The Xiang Army and its successor, the Huai Army, created by Zeng Guofan's colleague and mentee Li Hongzhang, were collectively called the &quot;Yong Ying&quot; (Brave Camp).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the Qing armies to lose many battles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taiping Rebellion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city did the Qing lose in 1853?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nanjing </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Zeng Guofan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xiang Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created a new type of army to thwart the Taiping rebels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zeng Guofan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Xiang Army named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hunan region where it was raised</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Zeng Guofan had no prior military experience.

Qi Jiguang's doctrine was based on Neo-Confucian ideas of binding troops' loyalty to their immediate superiors and also to the regions in which they were raised.

The advent of modern weaponry resulting from the European Industrial Revolution had rendered China's traditionally trained and equipped army and navy obsolete.

Finally, in December 1894, the Qing government took concrete steps to reform military institutions and to re-train selected units in westernized drills, tactics and weaponry.

The population doubled during the 18th century. People in this period were also remarkably on the move. There is evidence suggesting that the empire's rapidly expanding population was geographically mobile on a scale, which, in term of its volume and its protracted and routinized nature, was unprecedented in Chinese history. Indeed, the Qing government did far more to encourage mobility than to discourage it. Migration took several different forms, though might be divided in two varieties: permanent migration for resettlement, and relocation conceived by the party (in theory at least) as a temporary sojourn. Parties to the latter would include the empire's increasingly large and mobile manual workforce, as well as its densely overlapping internal diaspora of local-origin-based merchant groups. It would also included the patterned movement of Qing subjects overseas, largely to Southeastern Asia, in search of trade and other economic opportunities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened in early and middle Qing history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">population growth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the population grow during the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">doubled </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the 2 types of migration during the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">permanent migration for resettlement, and relocation conceived by the party (in theory at least) as a temporary sojourn</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to statute, Qing society was divided into relatively closed estates, of which in most general terms there were five. Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively minuscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding literati, there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status. They were divided into two categories: one of them, the good &quot;commoner&quot; people, the other &quot;mean&quot; people. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as liangmin, a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to jianmin meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional four occupational groups of scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants were &quot;good&quot;, or having a status of commoners. On the other hand, slaves or bondservants, entertainers (including prostitutes and actors), and those low-level employees of government officials were the &quot;mean people&quot;. Mean people were considered legally inferior to commoners and suffered unequal treatments, forbidden to take the imperial examination.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many estates were there in Qing society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 2 groups were normal Chinese broken into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the good &quot;commoner&quot; people, the other &quot;mean&quot; people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the legal term for commoner?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">liangmin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the end of the 17th century, the Chinese economy had recovered from the devastation caused by the wars in which the Ming dynasty were overthrown, and the resulting breakdown of order. In the following century, markets continued to expand as in the late Ming period, but with more trade between regions, a greater dependence on overseas markets and a greatly increased population. After the re-opening of the southeast coast, which had been closed in the late 17th century, foreign trade was quickly re-established, and was expanding at 4% per annum throughout the latter part of the 18th century. China continued to export tea, silk and manufactures, creating a large, favorable trade balance with the West. The resulting inflow of silver expanded the money supply, facilitating the growth of competitive and stable markets.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did China export?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> tea, silk and manufactures</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Chinese get paid for their goods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silver </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Chinese economy finally recover after the wars with the Mings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">end of the 17th century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax. To give people more incentives to participate in the market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers. The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient, and transport opened to private merchants. A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages, and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century. Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas. These restrictions on domestic resource exploration, as well as on foreign trade, are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence, by which the Western world overtook China economically.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Qing do to reform land ownership?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reduced the tax burden</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the price of rice during the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rise slowly and smoothly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Great Divergence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western world overtook China economically</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the end of the 18th century the population had risen to 300 million from approximately 150 million during the late Ming dynasty. The dramatic rise in population was due to several reasons, including the long period of peace and stability in the 18th century and the import of new crops China received from the Americas, including peanuts, sweet potatoes and maize. New species of rice from Southeast Asia led to a huge increase in production. Merchant guilds proliferated in all of the growing Chinese cities and often acquired great social and even political influence. Rich merchants with official connections built up huge fortunes and patronized literature, theater and the arts. Textile and handicraft production boomed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was China's population at the end of the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">300 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the reasons for the population explosion during the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peace and stability in the 18th century and the import of new crops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What crops were imported?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peanuts, sweet potatoes and maize.

The Kangxi Emperor sponsored the Peiwen Yunfu, a rhyme dictionary published in 1711, and the Kangxi Dictionary published in 1716, which remains to this day an authoritative reference. The Qianlong Emperor sponsored the largest collection of writings in Chinese history, the Siku Quanshu, completed in 1782. Court painters made new versions of the Song masterpiece, Zhang Zeduan's Along the River During the Qingming Festival whose depiction of a prosperous and happy realm demonstrated the beneficence of the emperor. The emperors undertook tours of the south and commissioned monumental scrolls to depict the grandeur of the occasion.

Poetry continued as a mark of the cultivated gentleman, but women wrote in larger and larger numbers and poets came from all walks of life. The poetry of the Qing dynasty is a lively field of research, being studied (along with the poetry of the Ming dynasty) for its association with Chinese opera, developmental trends of Classical Chinese poetry, the transition to a greater role for vernacular language, and for poetry by women in Chinese culture. The Qing dynasty was a period of much literary collection and criticism, and many of the modern popular versions of Classical Chinese poems were transmitted through Qing dynasty anthologies, such as the Quantangshi and the Three Hundred Tang Poems. Pu Songling brought the short story form to a new level in his Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, published in the mid-18th century, and Shen Fu demonstrated the charm of the informal memoir in Six Chapters of a Floating Life, written in the early 19th century but published only in 1877. The art of the novel reached a pinnacle in Cao Xueqin's Dream of the Red Chamber, but its combination of social commentary and psychological insight were echoed in highly skilled novels such as Wu Jingzi's The Scholars (1750) and Li Ruzhen's Flowers in the Mirror (1827).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the sign of a gentleman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Poetry </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who started writing poety during the Qing dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">women </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Pu Songling's collection of short stories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Strange Stories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the novel Dream of the Red Chamber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cao Xueqin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Shen Fu's memoir?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Six Chapters of a Floating Life</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cuisine aroused a cultural pride in the accumulated richness of a long and varied past.
