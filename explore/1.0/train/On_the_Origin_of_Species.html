Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Origin of Species published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 24 November 1859</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote The Origin of Species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Darwin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of biology was The Origin of Species founded on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evolutionary biology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the expedition called that Charles Darwin discovered some of his evidence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beagle expedition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do populations evolve according to Charles Darwin's theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> through a process of natural selection</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group of scientists began to support evolutionary ideas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dissident anatomists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which powerful religious institution was a big part of scientific study in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Church of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the general opinion about transmutation of species in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the majority of science see humanity in relation to animals in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which theology did everyone agree science was a part of in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural theology</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T. H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During &quot;the eclipse of Darwinism&quot; from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What section of the population was Darwin's book written for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-specialist readers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who attempted to secularize science during the debate over Darwin's book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">T. H.

After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group wanted to assuage fears that science was a threat to religious stability?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Royal Society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose theory claimed that species were unchanging and designed by God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Ray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created a biological classification in 1735?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carl Linnaeus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Ussher chronology state that creation began?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 4004 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who proposed that life is a self-maintaining, infinite cycle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> James Hutton</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Charles Darwin's grandfather?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Erasmus Darwin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What theory did Erasmus Darwin outline in the 1790s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hypothesis of transmutation of species </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the scientist who developed and published a more complex version of Erasmus Darwin's theory in 1809?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process of adapting to the environment and inheriting changes through use or disuse called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Lamarckism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose paleontology work in the 1790s established the reality of extinction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Georges Cuvier</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Britain, William Paley's Natural Theology saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial &quot;design&quot; by the Creator acting through natural laws.

Geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood. Some anatomists such as Robert Grant were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose work considered adaptation to be evidence of God's design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> William Paley's </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of William Paley's book claiming divine beneficial design? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Natural Theology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion were all naturalists working at the two English universities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Church of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did most naturalists view the concept of transmutation of species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a threat to divinely appointed social order.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did geologists explain the creation of new species in keeping with their belief in divine creation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Darwin went to Edinburgh University in 1825 to study medicine.

Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their &quot;centre of creation&quot;. The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed &quot;miserable, degraded savages&quot;, and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.

Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that &quot;one species does change into another&quot; to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms. Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists.

Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream.

His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What creatures did Darwin study that made him believe variation arose constantly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> barnacle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Darwin begin to work on his evolution theory full-time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1854</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By which year had Darwin's theory become more complex and supported by a lot of evidence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1856</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which bird species did Darwin become extremely interested in studying?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fancy pigeon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species did Darwin study for dispersal across oceans&gt;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plant seeds and animals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An 1855 paper on the &quot;introduction&quot; of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a &quot;sketch&quot; account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the &quot;Introduction of Species&quot; paper written?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1855</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the &quot;Introduction of Species&quot; paper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Alfred Russel Wallace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Wallace claim that patterns in the distribution of species could be explained?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scientist recognized the possible validity and implications of Wallace's paper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Lyell </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Lyell ask Darwin to publish his theory to give it priority?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1–2 May 1856</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Darwin was hard at work on his &quot;big book&quot; on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that &quot;your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled&quot; and he would &quot;of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal&quot; that Wallace chose, adding that &quot;all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed&quot;. Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which book was Darwin working on when he received a package from Wallace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;big book&quot; on Natural Selection,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was in the packages Darwin received from Wallace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the paper, On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Wallace </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the paper, On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Darwin </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some historians think made Wallace's concept of natural selection different from Darwin's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the meeting, Darwin decided to write &quot;an abstract of my whole work&quot;.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated &quot;favoured races&quot; as &quot;perfected races&quot;, and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.

Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called &quot;sports&quot; or &quot;monstrosities&quot; (example: ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far back does Chapter One of On the Origin of Species go in its coverage of animal and plant species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> ancient Egypt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Darwin use to illustrate the effects of artificial selection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fancy pigeon breeding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what does Darwin assert all pigeons are descended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> one species of rock pigeon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which evolutionary changes were the most important to Darwin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the small changes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between species and varieties is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found.

Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection.

However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation.

Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he again cited Principles of Geology and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion, including an estimate that erosion of The Weald had taken 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose argument did Darwin borrow that geological record is very imperfect, because fossilization is rare?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Lyell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which book written by Charles Lyell contains the argument that fossils are too rare to be used as proof of life suddenly arising?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Principles of Geology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Darwin hope to find as he continued to explore new geologic discoveries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hat new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Darwin estimate the erosion of the Weald to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 300 million years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the group of well-developed organisms that were discovered within fossil-bearing layers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Cambrian explosion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at the same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Darwin expect species to change and evolve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">slowly, but not at the same rate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Darwin believe were the key things needed for variation of species to form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">variability and change in the environment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scientist theorized that the earliest members of a class in a species were simple and generalized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Richard Owen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Darwin discover about more recently extinct species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: &quot;On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.&quot; Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why couldn't differences in flora and fauna be explained by differences in regions alone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Darwin consider that could explain why different regions could have such different species when they are close together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the combination of effects that Darwin considered the most important in determining the differences in species that evolved separately in similar environments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Darwin discusses morphology, including the importance of homologous structures.

David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail.

There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas.

Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection.

Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for &quot;extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated&quot; and coining the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.

Others that rejected natural selection, but supported &quot;creation by birth&quot;, included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the &quot;Great Hippocampus Question&quot; and parodied in The Water-Babies as the &quot;great hippopotamus test&quot;, Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process.

It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did most scientists accept the validity of evolution by the 1870s, but considered natural selection a minor part of it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was meant by the term saltationism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new species were thought to arise through &quot;jumps&quot; rather than gradual adaptation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for the belief that species have a tendency to change and adapt in a certain direction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">orthogenesis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the minority view on evolution that was believed by August Weismann?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neo-Darwinism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rediscovered inheritance was thought to invalidate Darwin's views on evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mendelian inheritance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While some, like Spencer, used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believed that action needed to be taken to level out the social and economic playing field before natural selection could occur to improve humanity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alfred Russel Wallace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which political commentary attempted to widen the idea of natural selection to include competition between different races of people and countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were some political commentaries attempting to attach natural selection to human races?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What uses of his ideology did Darwin object to being used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> to justify military aggression and unethical business practices </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What theory about humanity did Darwin oppose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as &quot;just as noble a conception of Deity&quot;. In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as &quot;a celebrated cleric&quot;, and added the phrase &quot;by the Creator&quot; to the closing sentence, which from then on read &quot;life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one&quot;. While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to &quot;creation&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What view did Louis Agassiz have of On the Origin of Species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strongly opposed to the ideas in the book</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What view did some clergymen in the Church of England take of the theory of natural selection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Darwin do to show that he admired the cleric Charles Kingsley? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Darwin quoted Kingsley as &quot;a celebrated cleric&quot;, and added the phrase &quot;by the Creator&quot; to the closing sentence, </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did some commentators think about Darwin changing the phrasing in his book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Darwin's views on the part of God in his theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Baden Powell praised &quot;Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature&quot;.

Theistic evolution became a popular compromise, and St. George Jackson Mivart was among those accepting evolution but attacking Darwin's naturalistic mechanism.

This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind's position at the head of nature. While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, Charles Hodge argued in his 1874 critique &quot;What is Darwinism?&quot; that &quot;Darwinism&quot;, defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design. Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin's text. By the early 20th century, four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution, but fundamentalism inspired the American creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s. Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century, but other Catholic writers, starting with Mivart, pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area. The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did people attempt to rationalize or reconcile the concept of natural selection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scientist argued that Darwinism was atheism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Hodge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What controversy around Darwin's book began in the 1920s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the American creation–evolution controversy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What official position did the Vatican take on the subject of evolution in 1950?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern evolutionary theory continues to develop.
