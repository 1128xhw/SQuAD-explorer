Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes up Education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What methods make up Education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does education usually take place under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the guidance of educators</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What occurred after the Fall of Rome with literature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic Church became the sole preserver</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened with education  during the Early Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">church established cathedral schools</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did these early schools during the Middle Ages evolve into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medieval universities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the famous school during the high middle ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chartres Cathedral School</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students.

In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising. Under the Education For All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior school.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term used for Primary education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elementary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does primary school consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">first five to seven years of formal, structured education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the orgination who is striving to get all the countries on the same path with primary education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UNESCO</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive primary education for minors, to the optional, selective tertiary, &quot;postsecondary&quot;, or &quot;higher&quot; education (e.g. university, vocational school) for adults. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or high schools, gymnasiums, lyceums, middle schools, colleges, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada and Australia, primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as K-12 education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give common knowledge, to prepare for higher education, or to train directly in a profession.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does secondary education comprise of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formal education that occurs during adolescence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two examples were given of what &quot;postsecondary&quot; or &quot;higher&quot; education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">university, vocational school</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does secondary schooling typically take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">teenage years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of secondary education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to prepare for higher education, or to train directly in a profession.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers.

A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including alternative schools, self learning, homeschooling and unschooling. Example alternative schools include Montessori schools, Waldorf schools (or Steiner schools), Friends schools, Sands School, Summerhill School, The Peepal Grove School, Sudbury Valley School, Krishnamurti schools, and open classroom schools.

Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. Additionally, Transparency International has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa. Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved.
