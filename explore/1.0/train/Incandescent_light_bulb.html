The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of energy makes an incandescent light bulb glow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electric current</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the incandescent light bulb is heated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wire filament</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of a halogen light bulb supplies electric current?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What provides the electricity to most light bulbs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a socket</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of light bulb uses inert gas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">incandescent light bulb</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%.

The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy.

This received a British Patent in 1880.[dubious – discuss] On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical, they had a very short lifetime. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' and obtained British Patent 4933 in 1880. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Joseph Swan demonstrate his lamp in January 1879?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which vacuum pump expert helped Swan invent his lamp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Stearn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Swan's first lamp not commercially viable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">'parchmentised thread'</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Swan receive a patent for parchmentised thread?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1880</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first public building to install electric lighting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Thomas Edison began serious research into developing a practical incandescent lamp in 1878.

Due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum, the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do fluorescent lights have a higher or lower luminous efficiency than incandescents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">higher</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can luminescent light sources be modified to resemble the appearance of incandescents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">By careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used, and fluorescent coatings which modify the spectral distribution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are luminescent light sources not ideal for photography?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The initial cost of an incandescent bulb is small compared to the cost of the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, over the course of a year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What appliance requires more energy due to the use of incandescent lighting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a building's air conditioning system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do incandescent lights have a longer or shorter life than other lighting sources?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shorter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some factors to consider in calculating operating costs of lighting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do incandescent lights emit more, less, or the same amount of light as they age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">less</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is more cost-effective, heat from incandescent bulbs or heat from a building's heating system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heat from the heating system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since incandescent light bulbs use more energy than alternatives such as CFLs and LED lamps, many governments have introduced measures to ban their use, by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps.

In the &quot;flashing&quot; process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or &quot;graphitized&quot; filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament.

The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power.

Small variations in resistivity along the filament cause &quot;hot spots&quot; to form at points of higher resistivity; a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life. These hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, which increases the resistance at that point—this creates a positive feedback that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament.

General service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly argon and some nitrogen, or sometimes krypton. Lamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to AC operation; different alloys of tungsten and rhenium can be used to counteract the effect.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the negative effect of &quot;hot spots&quot; forming on the filament?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered that inert gas could slow evaporation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Irving Langmuir</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which gases are typically used in a light bulb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">argon and some nitrogen, or sometimes krypton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of alloys can decrease &quot;stairstep&quot; irregularities in light bulb filaments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alloys of tungsten and rhenium</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While inert gas reduces filament evaporation, it also conducts heat from the filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency.

They conclude that Edison's version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors: an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve (by use of the Sprengel pump) and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made power distribution economically viable in Edison's lamp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high resistance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many inventors came up with electric lamps before Thomas Edison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Edison achieve a higher vacuum than other inventors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by use of the Sprengel pump</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which historians wrote about the advantages of Edison's lamp over other early versions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Friedel and Paul Israel</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
