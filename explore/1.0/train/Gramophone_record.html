The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc. Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12&quot;, 10&quot;, 7&quot;), the rotational speed in rpm at which they are played (16 2⁄3, 33 1⁄3, 45, 78), and their time capacity resulting from a combination of those parameters (LP – long playing 33 1⁄3 rpm, SP – 78 rpm single, EP – 12-inch single or extended play, 33 or 45 rpm); their reproductive quality or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc.), and the number of audio channels provided (mono, stereo, quad, etc.).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does LP stand for when it comes to time capacity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> long playing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are common diameters found in phonograph records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12&quot;, 10&quot;, 7&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a gramophone or 'vinyl' record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">analogue sound storage medium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the groove on a vinyl record typically start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">near the periphery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what method is the rotational speed measured in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rpm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the late 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. From the 1990s to the 2010s, records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale, and were especially used by disc jockeys (DJ)s, released by artists in some genres, and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009. Likewise, in the UK sales have increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the primary use of a phonographic disc record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">music reproduction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which year did vinyl records leave the main steam media market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From the 1990s to 2010s who was the primary consumer of vinyl records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disc jockeys (DJ)s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many phonograph records were sold in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9.2 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the niche market of phonograph record fans known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">audiophiles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The phonautograph, patented by Léon Scott in 1857, used a vibrating diaphragm and stylus to graphically record sound waves as tracings on sheets of paper, purely for visual analysis and without any intent of playing them back.

Phonautograms of singing and speech made by Scott in 1860 were played back as sound for the first time in 2008.

Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, with the idea of creating a &quot;telephone repeater&quot; analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately. The Scientific American article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned Marey, Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but, importantly, not reproducing sound. Edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats. Numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned, but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations, the tinfoil phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use. A decade later, Edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil sheet. This proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device. The wax phonograph cylinder created the recorded sound market at the end of the 1880s and dominated it through the early years of the 20th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Thomas Edison invent the phonograph?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1877</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the phonograph differ from the phonautograph?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capable of both recording and reproducing sound</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was unique about Einsteins invention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reproducing sound</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what era was the recorded sound market introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1880s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lateral-cut disc records were developed in the United States by Emile Berliner, who named his system the &quot;gramophone&quot;, distinguishing it from Edison's wax cylinder &quot;phonograph&quot; and Columbia's wax cylinder &quot;graphophone&quot;. Berliner's earliest discs, first marketed in 1889, but only in Europe, were 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter, and were played with a small hand-propelled machine. Both the records and the machine were adequate only for use as a toy or curiosity, due to the limited sound quality. In the United States in 1894, under the Berliner Gramophone trademark, Berliner started marketing records with somewhat more substantial entertainment value, along with somewhat more substantial gramophones to play them. Berliner's records had poor sound quality compared to wax cylinders, but his manufacturing associate Eldridge R. Johnson eventually improved the sound quality. Abandoning Berliner's &quot;Gramophone&quot; trademark for legal reasons, in 1901 Johnson's and Berliner's separate companies reorganized to form the Victor Talking Machine Company, whose products would come to dominate the market for many years. Emile Berliner moved his company to Montreal in 1900. The factory which became RCA Victor stills exists. There is a dedicated museum in Montreal for Berliner.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of lateral cut disc records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gramophone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was an issue found with Berliner's records initially? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> poor sound quality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were lateral cut disc records developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is 'Victor Talking Machine now known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RCA Victor </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the museum dedicated to Berliner located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Montreal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the discs Edison introduced in 1909?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blue Amberol cylinders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the patent for lateral cut discs expire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What format dominated the market in the late 1980s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">digital compact disc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What disc format was the least fragile prior to 1919?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amberol cylinder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the playing surface of the blue amerbol cylinder discs made of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">celluloid</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Early recordings were made entirely acoustically, the sound being collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm, which vibrated the cutting stylus.

Lower-pitched orchestral instruments such as cellos and double basses were often doubled (or replaced) by louder wind instruments, such as tubas.

Western Electric's innovations resulted in a greatly expanded and more even frequency response, creating a dramatically fuller, clearer and more natural-sounding recording. Distant or less strong sounds that were impossible to record by the old methods could now be captured. Volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the limitations of the intended playback device. Victor and Columbia licensed the new electrical system from Western Electric and began issuing electrically recorded discs in 1925. The first classical recording was of Chopin impromptus and Schubert's Litanei by Alfred Cortot for Victor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was an early took used to amplify sounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> vacuum tubes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company was vital in progression of quality sound recordings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western Electric</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How early were electrically recorded discs made available for purchase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1925</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was new about the way Western Electrics method of capturing sound?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">microphone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How could the sounds produced by Western Electric be described?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> fuller, clearer and more natural</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Electrical recording preceded electrical home reproduction because of the initial high cost of the new system.

Around 1895, a shellac-based compound was introduced and became standard. Exact formulas for this compound varied by manufacturer and over the course of time, but it was typically composed of about one-third shellac and about two-thirds mineral filler, which meant finely pulverized rock, usually slate and limestone, with an admixture of cotton fibers to add tensile strength, carbon black for color (without this, it tended to be a &quot;dirty&quot; gray or brown color that most record companies considered unattractive), and a very small amount of a lubricant to facilitate mold release during manufacture. Some makers, notably Columbia Records, used a laminated construction with a core disc of coarser material or fiber. The production of shellac records continued until the end of the 78 rpm format (i.e., the late 1950s in most developed countries, but well into the 1960s in some other places), but increasingly less abrasive formulations were used during its declining years and very late examples in truly like-new condition can have as low noise levels as vinyl.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What materials were discs made of in 1889-1894?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> hard rubber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the standard material for discs around 1895?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a shellac-based compound</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company was known for laminate construction of discs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Columbia Records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material give the vinyl records their known black color?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> carbon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material is used in order to release the vinyl records from their molds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> lubricant</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Flexible or so-called &quot;unbreakable&quot; records made of unusual materials were introduced by a number of manufacturers at various times during the 78 rpm era. In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored &quot;Marconi Velvet Tone Record&quot; pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long. The contemporary French Pathé Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resembles the vinyl &quot;sound sheet&quot; magazine inserts of the 1965–1985 era, were similarly short-lived. In the US, Hit of the Week records, made of a patented translucent plastic called Durium coated on a heavy brown paper base, were introduced in early 1930. A new issue came out every week and they were sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine. Although inexpensive and commercially successful at first, they soon fell victim to the Great Depression and production in the US ended in 1932. Related Durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the UK and elsewhere, and as remarkably late as 1950 in Italy, where the name &quot;Durium&quot; survived far into the LP era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records. Despite all these attempts at innovation, shellac compounds continued to be used for the overwhelming majority of commercial 78 rpm records during the lifetime of the format.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a major downfall of the success of Durium records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Depression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year were Durium records no longer released in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1932</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are most 78 rpm records made of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shellac compound</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a common problem found in early flexible records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">surface noise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the thin translucent plastic most successfully used to make discs called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Durium</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce &quot;unbreakable&quot; children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material was used by RCA Victor for special purpose records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> vinyl-based Victrolac compound</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Metrolite and Sav-o-flex materials primarily used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> children's records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Victrolac compound released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1931</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were advantages of vinyl in the 1930's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a downfall of ordinary 78 rpm vinyls in household house?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">higher cost</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1890s, the recording formats of the earliest (toy) discs were mainly 12.5 cm (nominally five inches) in diameter; by the mid-1890s, the discs were usually 7 in (nominally 17.5 cm) in diameter. By 1910 the 10-inch (25.4 cm) record was by far the most popular standard, holding about three minutes of music or other entertainment on a side. From 1903 onwards, 12-inch records (30.5 cm) were also sold commercially, mostly of classical music or operatic selections, with four to five minutes of music per side. Victor, Brunswick and Columbia also issued 12-inch popular medleys, usually spotlighting a Broadway show score. However, other sizes did appear. Eight-inch discs with a 2-inch-diameter (51 mm) label became popular for about a decade in Britain, but they cannot be played in full on most modern record players because the tone arm cannot play far enough in toward the center without modification of the equipment.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the most popular sized disc by 1910?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10-inch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long could a recording be on a 10 inch disc in the 1903?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four to five minutes of music per side</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How small were the earliest discs released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12.5 cm </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one requirement issue with discs popular in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> modification of the equipment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which disc could hold about three minutes of recording on either side?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 10-inch</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factors would effect playing time of a phonograph?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">turntable speed and the groove spacing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the playing time common in the early 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> two minutes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many recordings did Kind Oliver's Creole Jazz band require?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the normal size disc for popular music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10-inch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the recording time available on a 12 inch disc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> three and a half minutes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In January 1938, Milt Gabler started recording for his new label, Commodore Records, and to allow for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records. Eddie Condon explained: &quot;Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development.&quot; The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: &quot;Carnegie Drag&quot; was 3:15; &quot;Carnegie Jump&quot;, 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: &quot;Embraceable You&quot; was 4:05; &quot;Serenade to a Shylock&quot;, 4:32. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded &quot;Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean&quot;, written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot; in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's &quot;Soliloquy&quot;, from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7:57, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record. The same was true of John Raitt's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel, which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On which label did Frank Sinatra release his recording of Soliloquy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Columbia's Masterwork label</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a typical recording time of a song in 1948?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> about 3:30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a way musicians got sounds such short recording times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> release a set of records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many sides of a disc commonly held a recording?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> two sides</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>German record company Odeon is often said to have pioneered the album in 1909 when it released the Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky on 4 double-sided discs in a specially designed package.

This was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records, hence the label's name (obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s &quot;hi-fi&quot; era, when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before).

RCA Victor developed the 45 rpm format and marketed it in March 1949, each pursuing their own r&amp;d in secret. Both types of new disc used narrower grooves, intended to be played with smaller stylus—typically 0.001 inches (25 µm) wide, compared to 0.003 inches (76 µm) for a 78—so the new records were sometimes called Microgroove. In the mid-1950s all record companies agreed to a common recording standard called RIAA equalization.

EP discs were cheaper to produce, and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue LP albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players. LP albums could be purchased 1 EP at a time, with four items per EP, or in a boxed set with 3 EPs or 12 items. The large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. EPs were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the U.S. as three- and four-speed record players replaced the individual 45 players. One indication of the decline of the 45 rpm EP is that the last Columbia Records reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 45 rpm EP records, called Frank Sinatra (Columbia B-2641) was issued on December 7, 1959.

When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui).

Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as &quot;being in the living presence of the orchestra&quot; by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still based on the principle of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35 mm magnetic film instead of half-inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35 mm magnetic film prevented tape layer print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of 3-to-2 mix directly to the master recorder.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which company did C.

These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called &quot;diaphragming&quot; the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. Lower recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end farther away from the disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What technique were used to reduce inner-groove distortion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the Dynagroove format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RCA Victor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did some music lovers frown upon diaphragming? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unnatural side effects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did closer groove spacing result in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lower recorded volume</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would be found with higher recorded volumes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wider spacing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Also in the late 1970s, &quot;direct-to-disc&quot; records were produced, aimed at an audiophile niche market.

Many pre-1952 LPs, however, played for about 15 minutes per side. The 7-inch 45 rpm format normally contains one item per side but a 7-inch EP could achieve recording times of 10 to 15 minutes at the expense of attenuating and compressing the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were generally used to make available tracks not on singles including tracks on LPs albums in a smaller, less expensive format for those who had only 45 rpm players.

Precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove, since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a 'lead out'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wide-pitched section </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the center where the data joins to complete a circle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lock groove</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do turntables play music on lock grooves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most automatic turntables are incapable </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do most automatic turn tables do when they meet a lock groove?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> lift the arm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do you find a lead out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Towards the center, at the end of the groove</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When auto-changing turntables were commonplace, records were typically pressed with a raised (or ridged) outer edge and a raised label area, allowing records to be stacked onto each other without the delicate grooves coming into contact, reducing the risk of damage. Auto-changers included a mechanism to support a stack of several records above the turntable itself, dropping them one at a time onto the active turntable to be played in order. Many longer sound recordings, such as complete operas, were interleaved across several 10-inch or 12-inch discs for use with auto-changing mechanisms, so that the first disk of a three-disk recording would carry sides 1 and 6 of the program, while the second disk would carry sides 2 and 5, and the third, sides 3 and 4, allowing sides 1, 2, and 3 to be played automatically; then the whole stack reversed to play sides 4, 5, and 6.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were records made with raised label areas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> reducing the risk of damage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are longer recordings, as found in operas, made for use with auto-changing systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> interleaved across several 10-inch or 12-inch discs for use with auto-changing mechanisms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do grooves on records touch when stacked?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allowing records to be stacked onto each other without the delicate grooves coming into contact</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do records touch when in auto changers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Auto-changers included a mechanism to support a stack</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>New or &quot;virgin&quot; heavy/heavyweight (180–220 g) vinyl is commonly used for modern audiophile vinyl releases in all genres.

The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a &quot;metallic soap,&quot; containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut &quot;wax&quot; sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual &quot;plating&quot; of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, &quot;matrix&quot; or &quot;father.&quot; The &quot;father&quot; is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a &quot;mother&quot;. Many mothers can be grown on a single &quot;father&quot; before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The &quot;mothers&quot; are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as &quot;sons&quot;. Each &quot;mother&quot; can be used to make many &quot;sons&quot; before deteriorating. The &quot;sons&quot; are then converted into &quot;stampers&quot; by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the &quot;father&quot;), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a &quot;son&quot; (for each side), the &quot;father&quot; is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the &quot;two-step-process&quot; (as it does not entail creation of &quot;sons&quot; but does involve creation of &quot;mothers,&quot; which are used for test playing and kept as &quot;safeties&quot; for electroforming future &quot;sons&quot;) is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The &quot;sons&quot; made during a &quot;three-step&quot; electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than &quot;fathers&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the two step process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;father&quot; is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the limitation of the two step process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which is preferred the two step or three step process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three-step</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which have stronger structures the father or son mold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can increase the output of a stamper mold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quality of the vinyl is high</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Breakage was very common in the shellac era.

This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal (restoring force) used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic frequencies below about 20 Hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble (&quot;tracking noise&quot;) and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100 Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5 Hz (the frequency at which a 33 1⁄3 rpm record turns on the turntable; 5⁄9 Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for very low frequency material can be a warped disk: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a switchable subsonic filter. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would be a cause of low frequency sounds when listening?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">warped disk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a feature many stereos contain to fight back against unwanted noises?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subsonic filter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a sounds commonly heard when listening to a vinyl that is unintentional.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tonearm skating</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which frequencies are you most likely to hear tonearm skating?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> frequencies below about 20 Hz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are there any visual signs of tracking when listening to a record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae.

At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise.

Therefore, it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 Hz, the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H.

From about 1950 on (earlier for some large record companies, later for some small ones) it became usual to have the performance first recorded on audio tape, which could then be processed and/or edited, and then dubbed on to the master disc. A record cutter would engrave the grooves into the master disc. Early versions of these master discs were soft wax, and later a harder lacquer was used. The mastering process was originally something of an art as the operator had to manually allow for the changes in sound which affected how wide the space for the groove needed to be on each rotation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who would engrave the master disc of a vinyl record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> record cutter </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was used in first recordings of vinyl records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soft wax</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was used in final recordings of vinyl records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">harder lacquer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the 1950s  what was a typical recording process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> first recorded on audio tape, which could then be processed and/or edited, and then dubbed on to the master disc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were sound recordings originally made to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">master disc</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the playing of gramophone records causes gradual degradation of the recording, they are best preserved by transferring them onto other media and playing the records as rarely as possible.

For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s. Anyone can do this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer. However, for accurate transfer, professional archivists carefully choose the correct stylus shape and diameter, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is it difficult to transfer recording from historic interest to newer technologies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Anyone can do this</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would offer the highest quality transfers of historic interest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">professional archivists </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would a hobbiest need to transfer historic recordings to digital formats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is an original destroyed when transferred to digital format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> without any further damage to the source recording</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one benefit of transferring an older format to a newer format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> manipulated to remove analog flaws</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Groove recordings, first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a major cause of declined vinyl sales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> major label distributors restricted their return policies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which allows for more profits, vinyl or compact discs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did vinyl record sales decline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> between 1988 and 1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did compact disc popularity take hold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were groove recordings developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">final quarter of the 19th century,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In spite of their flaws, such as the lack of portability, records still have enthusiastic supporters.

DJ techniques such as slip-cueing, beatmatching, and scratching originated on turntables. With CDs or compact audio cassettes one normally has only indirect manipulation options, e.g., the play, stop, and pause buttons. With a record one can place the stylus a few grooves farther in or out, accelerate or decelerate the turntable, or even reverse its direction, provided the stylus, record player, and record itself are built to withstand it.
