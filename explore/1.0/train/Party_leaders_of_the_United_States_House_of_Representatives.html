The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs who died in a plane crash, and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In 1998, with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation, both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between majority leader and speaker what roles did Boehner have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What republican majority leader died in a plane crash?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Hale Boggs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Since 1995 who is the only majority leader to become speaker?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> John Boehner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who succeeded Newt Gingrich as Speaker?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Dennis Hastert</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Traditionally, the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party in the House, with the Majority Leader as second-in-command.

Despite this, Cantor and his successor, Kevin McCarthy, have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House, since Boehner is still reckoned as the leader of the House Republicans. However, there have been some exceptions. The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006.
