It involved every great power of the time except the Ottoman Empire, and affected Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India, and the Philippines. Considered a prelude to the two world wars and the greatest European war since the Thirty Years War of the 17th century, it once again split Europe into two coalitions, led by Great Britain on one side and France on the other. For the first time, aiming to curtail Britain and Prussia's ever-growing might, France formed a grand coalition of its own, which ended with failure as Britain rose as the world's predominant power, altering the European balance of power.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What countries led the two coalitions during the Seven Years' War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two coalitions, led by Great Britain on one side and France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What major power of the time was not involved in The Seven Years' War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">It involved every great power of the time except the Ottoman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Seven Year' War fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Seven Years' War was fought between 1755 and 1764</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country emerged as the world's predominate power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Britain rose as the world's predominant power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Seven Years' War considered as the prelude to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Considered a prelude to the two world wars</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Realizing that war was imminent, Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it.

Reluctantly, by following the imperial diet, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states (especially Hanover). Sweden, fearing Prussia's expansionist tendencies, went to war in 1757 to protect its Baltic dominions, seeing its chance when virtually all of Europe opposed Prussia. Spain, bound by the Pacte de Famille, intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an utterly unsuccessful invasion of Portugal in 1762.

In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum. Prussia emerged as a new European great power. Although Austria failed to retrieve the territory of Silesia from Prussia (its original goal) its military prowess was also noted by the other powers. The involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained French Louisiana and regained control of its colonies, e.g., Cuba and the Philippines, which had been captured by the British during the war.

France’s traditional enemies, Great Britain and Austria, had coalesced just as they had done against Louis XIV. Prussia, the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria had produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, had come to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France had concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747, and the maintenance of the Anglo-Austrian alignment after 1748 was deemed essential by the Duke of Newcastle, British secretary of state in the ministry of his brother Henry Pelham. The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the “diplomatic revolution” or the “reversal of alliances.”</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the traditional partner with Great Britain at the beginning of the conflict?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Great Britain and Austria, had coalesced</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was gained or lost by Austria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the major gain by Great Britain by having Austria as it ally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British subsidies to Austria had produced nothing of much help to the British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What alliances were formed in the &quot;diplomatic reversal&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the “diplomatic revolution”</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did the loss of Silesia by Austria intensify its battle with Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">.

They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now Kłodzko, Poland) to Austria in the event of hostilities with Prussia. Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick’s power altogether, reducing his sway to his electorate of Brandenburg and giving East Prussia to Poland, an exchange that would be accompanied by the cession of the Polish Duchy of Courland to Russia. Aleksey Petrovich, Graf (count) Bestuzhev-Ryumin, grand chancellor of Russia under Empress Elizabeth, was hostile to both France and Prussia, but he could not persuade Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz to commit to offensive designs against Prussia so long as Prussia was able to rely on French support.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Russian-Austrian agreement preceded the Seven Years War that started in 1755-56?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 2, 1746, Austria and Russia concluded a defensive alliance that covered their own territory and Poland against attack by Prussia or the Ottoman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to the Russian-Austrian pact of 1746, what would happen to Silesia in the event of hostilities with Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now Kłodzko, Poland) to Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other area was mentioned regarding Prussian dominion in the Russian-Austrian pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the countship of Glatz (now Kłodzko, Poland) to Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What individual was the main target of the pact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick’s power altogether</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why couldn't Petrovich persuade Austria to invade Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he could not persuade Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz to commit to offensive designs against Prussia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Hanoverian king George II of Great Britain was passionately devoted to his family’s continental holdings, but his commitments in Germany were counterbalanced by the demands of the British colonies overseas.

It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help (sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway. This strategy was to a degree forced upon France: geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies. Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any French ruler. Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the continent, hoping for victories closer to home. The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions. This approach did not serve France well in the war, as the colonies were indeed lost, but although much of the European war went well, by its end France had few counterbalancing European successes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much effort did France put into wars to defend its colonies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Identify a major factor in this feckless strategy by France of not defending its colonies with enthusiasm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the French rulers need a large domestic army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much success did France have in adding European territory with this approach?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> France had few counterbalancing European successes.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In treaty negotiations, what trades did France hope to make.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The British—by inclination as well as for practical reasons—had tended to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the Continent.

Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons. At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756, Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne. The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the Siege of Pirna, the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia. Far from being easy, Frederick's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia's smaller army. This led him to remark that he did not fight the same Austrians as he had during the previous war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much resistance did Frederick encounter in Saxon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What reinforcements were the Saxons expecting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the Saxon army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the result of the fury of Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What characteristic of Saxony caused Europe to be mad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Britain had been surprised by the sudden Prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and ₤670,000 (equivalent to ₤89.9 million in 2015) to its new ally.

After winning the bloody Battle of Prague on 6 May 1757, in which both forces suffered major casualties, the Prussians forced the Austrians back into the fortifications of Prague. The Prussian army then laid siege to the city. Following the battle at Prague, Frederick took 5,000 troops from the siege at Prague and sent them to reinforce the 19,000-man army under the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern at Kolin in Bohemia. Austrian Marshal Daun arrived too late to participate in the battle of Prague, but picked up 16,000 men who had escaped from the battle. With this army he slowly moved to relieve Prague. The Prussian army was too weak to simultaneously besiege Prague and keep Daun away, and Frederick was forced to attack prepared positions. The resulting Battle of Kolin was a sharp defeat for Frederick, his first military defeat. His losses further forced him to lift the siege and withdraw from Bohemia altogether.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Austrians retreat in May of 1757?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the fortifications of Prague</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were casualties like in the 1757 battle in Prague?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both forces suffered major casualties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Prussian assault on Prague in 1757</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Frederick II </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Frederick reduce his manpower at Prague?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Frederick took 5,000 troops from the siege at Prague and sent them to reinforce the 19,000-man army under the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern at Kolin in Bohemia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Austrian Marshall Daun reverse the situation at Prague?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> picked up 16,000 men who had escaped from the battle.

Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it. The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757. However, it was not yet able to take Königsberg and retreated soon afterward. Still, it was a new threat to Prussia. Not only was Frederick forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia, he was now forced to withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory. His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men.

In spite of this, the Prussians were now facing the prospect of four major powers attacking on four fronts (France from the West, Austria from the South, Russia from the East and Sweden from the North).

In short order, the Prussian army drove the Swedes back, occupied most of Swedish Pomerania, and blockaded its capital Stralsund. George II of Great Britain, on the advice of his British ministers, revoked the Convention of Klosterzeven, and Hanover reentered the war. Over the winter the new commander of the Hanoverian forces, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the French back across the River Rhine. The British had suffered further defeats in North America, particularly at Fort William Henry. At home, however, stability had been established. Since 1756, successive governments led by Newcastle and Pitt had fallen. In August 1757, the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a coalition government that gave new, firmer direction to the war effort. The new strategy emphasised both Newcastle's commitment to British involvement on the Continent, particularly in defence of Germany, and William Pitt's determination to use naval power to seize French colonies around the globe.

The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-Jägersdorf (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Prussian army perform in 1759/</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1759 saw several Prussian defeats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How would one characterize the encounter with the Russian army in 1757?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the result of the Battle of Maxen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened at Minden in 1757?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Frederick's army at the Battle at Kunersdorf?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frederick himself lost half his army </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The French planned to invade the British Isles during 1759 by accumulating troops near the mouth of the Loire and concentrating their Brest and Toulon fleets.

Spain, aided by the French, launched an invasion of Portugal and succeeded in capturing Almeida. The arrival of British reinforcements stalled a further Spanish advance, and the Battle of Valencia de Alcántara saw British-Portuguese forces overrun a major Spanish supply base. The invaders were stopped on the heights in front of Abrantes (called the pass to Lisbon) where the Anglo-Portuguese were entrenched. Eventually the Anglo-Portuguese army, aided by guerrillas and practicing a scorched earth strategy, chased the greatly reduced Franco-Spanish army back to Spain, recovering almost all the lost towns, among them the Spanish headquarters in Castelo Branco full of wounded and sick that had been left behind.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Identify a new country that joined the war in 1762?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Identify a second new country that joined the war in 1762?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portugal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city was captured in the first Spain-Portugal conflict?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">.

Her Prussophile successor, Peter III, at once recalled Russian armies from Berlin (see: the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)) and mediated Frederick's truce with Sweden. He also placed a corps of his own troops under Frederick's command This turn of events has become known as the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. Frederick was then able to muster a larger army of 120,000 men and concentrate it against Austria. He drove them from much of Saxony, while his brother Henry won a victory in Silesia in the Battle of Freiberg (29 October 1762).

Frederick had retaken most of Silesia and Saxony but not the latter's capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible. British subsidies had been stopped by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute, and the Russian Emperor had been overthrown by his wife, Catherine, who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, something which greatly affected its offensive power. Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray. By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, the county of Glatz, and southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the Treaty of Hubertusburg, ending the war in central Europe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1763 what was the status of Frederick?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1763 what was the status of Austria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had happened to Frederick's financial help from Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> British subsidies had been stopped by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had happened to Frederick's extra troops from Russia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catherine, who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the result of the weakening of both Prussia and Austria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the Treaty of Hubertusburg, ending the war in central Europe.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite the debatable strategic success and the operational failure of the descent on Rochefort, William Pitt—who saw purpose in this type of asymmetric enterprise—prepared to continue such operations.

The naval squadron and transports for the expedition were commanded by Richard Howe. The army landed on 5 June 1758 at Cancalle Bay, proceeded to St. Malo, and, finding that it would take prolonged siege to capture it, instead attacked the nearby port of St. Servan. It burned shipping in the harbor, roughly 80 French privateers and merchantmen, as well as four warships which were under construction. The force then re-embarked under threat of the arrival of French relief forces. An attack on Havre de Grace was called off, and the fleet sailed on to Cherbourg; the weather being bad and provisions low, that too was abandoned, and the expedition returned having damaged French privateering and provided further strategic demonstration against the French coast.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the style of William Pitt's warfare?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> saw purpose in this type of asymmetric enterprise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What action did Pitt take against France in 1758?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The army landed on 5 June 1758 at Cancalle Bay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the invading British army do at St. Malo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> it would take prolonged siege to capture it, instead attacked the nearby port of St. Servan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What damage was done at the alternate site?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> It burned shipping in the harbor, roughly 80 French privateers and merchantmen, as well as four warships which were under construction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the British invaders respond to the arrival of French relief forces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the expedition returned having damaged French privateering </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pitt now prepared to send troops into Germany; and both Marlborough and Sackville, disgusted by what they perceived as the futility of the &quot;descents&quot;, obtained commissions in that army.
