As a result of a movement earlier in the decade, many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone and Robert Peel. It was also supported by Prince Albert, who persuaded August Wilhelm von Hofmann to be the first professor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Royal College of Chemistry established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1845 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which politicians donated funds to establish the Royal College of Chemistry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone and Robert Peel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first professor of the Royal College of Chemistry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August Wilhelm von Hofmann</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the Royal College of Chemistry founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the United Kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supported the Royal College of Chemistry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Albert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Royal College of Chemistry established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1845</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was not well taught that led to the founding of the Royal College of Chemistry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">practical aspects of the experimental sciences</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country was ahead of the United Kingdom in the teaching of chemistry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Prince supported the establishment of the college?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Albert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first professor of the college?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August Wilhelm von Hofmann</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>City and Guilds College was founded in 1876 from a meeting of 16 of the City of London's livery companies for the Advancement of Technical Education (CGLI), which aimed to improve the training of craftsmen, technicians, technologists, and engineers. The two main objectives were to create a Central Institution in London and to conduct a system of qualifying examinations in technical subjects. Faced with their continuing inability to find a substantial site, the Companies were eventually persuaded by the Secretary of the Science and Art Department, General Sir John Donnelly (who was also a Royal Engineer) to found their institution on the eighty-seven acre (350,000 m²) site at South Kensington bought by the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners (for GBP 342,500) for 'purposes of art and science' in perpetuity. The latter two colleges were incorporated by Royal Charter into the Imperial College of Science and Technology and the CGLI Central Technical College was renamed the City and Guilds College in 1907, but not incorporated into Imperial College until 1910.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the City and Guilds College founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1876</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the aim of the City and Guilds College when it was founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">improve the training of craftsmen, technicians, technologists, and engineers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the main objectives of establishing the City and Guilds College?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to create a Central Institution in London and to conduct a system of qualifying examinations in technical subjects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners pay for the land that became the City and Guilds College?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GBP 342,500</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the former name of the City and Guilds College?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CGLI Central Technical College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which college was founded in 1876?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">City and Guilds College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many livery companies were in the meeting that founded the college?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does CGLI stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Advancement of Technical Education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than conducting a system of qualifying examinations, what was the other main objective of the meeting of CGLI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to create a Central Institution in London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How large was the land (in acres) that the institution was founded on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eighty-seven</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In December 2005, Imperial announced a science park programme at the Wye campus, with extensive housing; however, this was abandoned in September 2006 following complaints that the proposal infringed on Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and that the true scale of the scheme, which could have raised £110m for the College, was known to Kent and Ashford Councils and their consultants but concealed from the public. One commentator observed that Imperial's scheme reflected &quot;the state of democracy in Kent, the transformation of a renowned scientific college into a grasping, highly aggressive, neo-corporate institution, and the defence of the status of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty – throughout England, not just Wye – against rampant greed backed by the connivance of two important local authorities.

ICTV (formerly STOIC (Student Television of Imperial College)) is Imperial College Union's TV station, founded in 1969 and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block. The department had bought an early AMPEX Type A 1-inch videotape recorder and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972. Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block and interview programmes with DJ Mike Raven, Richard O'Brian and Monty Python producer Ian MacNaughton.

It is considered the highest honour given in the industrial chemical industry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered the first synthetic dye?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Henry Perkin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the scientist who discovered the dye do after discovering it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">resigned his position</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the first synthetic dye discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mauveine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The discovery of the synthetic dye is claimed by some histories to have sparked what event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second chemical revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which award is named after the discoverer of the dye?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Perkin Medal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Imperial acquired Silwood Park in 1947, to provide a site for research and teaching in those aspects of biology not well suited for the main London campus. Felix, Imperial's student newspaper, was launched on 9 December 1949. On 29 January 1950, the government announced that it was intended that Imperial should expand to meet the scientific and technological challenges of the 20th century and a major expansion of the College followed over the next decade. In 1959 the Wolfson Foundation donated £350,000 for the establishment of a new Biochemistry Department.[citation needed] A special relationship between Imperial and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi was established in 1963.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What site did Imperial acquire in 1947?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Silwood Park</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Imperial's student newspaper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Felix</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money was donated for a new Biochemistry Department?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£350,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who donated the large sum of money to help aid the establishement of the Biochemistry Department?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wolfson Foundation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Imperial formed a relationship with which other entity in 1963?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
