The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible. About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process begins after a death sentence is handed down at trial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">direct review</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In a direct review, what type of court looks at the record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">appellate </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many possible outcomes are there of a capital sentencing direct review?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In a direct review, what court has its record reviewed by the appellate court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trial </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of convictions survive direct review?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in federal court.

Yet, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review. In 2010, the death sentences of 53 inmates were overturned as a result of legal appeals or high court reversals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When a prisoner is given a death sentence in a state, what is the first step of collateral review?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">state collateral review</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About what percentage of capital convictions are overturned due to state collateral review?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2010, how many death sentences were overturned due to reversals from courts or appeals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">53 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of an issue that is raised in collateral review?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ineffective assistance of counsel</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what case did the Supreme Court allow Section 1983 to be used to challenge a method of execution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hill v.

The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done at least a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights.

Georgia decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman, and implied that the death penalty was inappropriate for any offense against another person other than murder. Prior to the decision, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, the State of Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for that offense. However, three states maintained the death penalty for child rape, as the Coker decision only imposed a ban on executions for the rape of an adult woman. In 2008, the Kennedy v. Louisiana decision barred the death penalty for child rape. The result of these two decisions means that the death penalty in the United States is largely restricted to cases where the defendant took the life of another human being. The current federal kidnapping statute, however, may be exempt because the death penalty applies if the victim dies in the perpetrator's custody, not necessarily by his hand, thus stipulating a resulting death, which was the wording of the objection. In addition, the Federal government retains the death penalty for non-murder offenses that are considered crimes against the state, including treason, espionage, and crimes under military jurisdiction.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Coker v.

Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not &quot;public&quot; because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public was not permitted to attend.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Missouri pass a law stating that executions should be inside of or near a jail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What procedure did Missouri use to execute prisoners in 1919?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hanging</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the Missouri of 1919, who handed out passes to witness executions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the local sheriff</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In approximately what year did a movement in favor of private executions begin in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1890</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Previous post-Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico, when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among them all four women on the state's death row. And during his two terms (1979–1987) as Florida's Governor, Bob Graham, although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of &quot;possible innocence&quot; or &quot;disproportionality.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commuted all state capital sentences in 1986?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Toney Anaya</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what state was Toney Anaya governor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Mexico</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Governor of Ohio in 1991?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dick Celeste</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many women were on Ohio's death row in 1991?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Bob Graham become Governor of Florida?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1979</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2010, bills to abolish the death penalty in Kansas and in South Dakota (which had a de facto moratorium at the time) were rejected.

For example, Hospira, the sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental, the critical anesthetic in the three-drug cocktail, announced in 2011 that it would no longer manufacture the drug for the American market, in part for ethical reasons and in part because its transfer of sodium thiopental manufacturing to Italy would subject it to the European Union's Torture Regulation, which forbids the use of any product manufactured within the Union for torture (as execution by lethal injection is considered by the Regulation). Since the drug manufacturers began taking these steps and the EU regulation ended the importation of drugs produced in Europe, the resulting shortage of execution drugs has led to or influenced decisions to impose moratoria in Arkansas, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many drugs are used to administer lethal injection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What lethal injection drug is manufactured by Hospira?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sodium thiopental</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Hospira cease to manufacture its lethal injection drug for the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country does Hospira manufacture sodium thiopental today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What EU law forbids products used in torture to be manufactured in the European Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Torture Regulation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
