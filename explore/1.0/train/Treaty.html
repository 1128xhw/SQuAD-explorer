First, formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through the ratification process all over again. The re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty. When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one a party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon. Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty. Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a procès-verbal; but a procès-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e. where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many ways are there to amend an existing treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must state parties to a treaty repeat to adopt a formal amendment to the treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ratification process</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What amendment process is generally reserved for changes that rectify obvious errors in the text?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a procès-verbal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Parties to an original treaty and an amended treaty are bound to what terms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the terms they both agreed upon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to the often long and protracted nature of treaty renegotiation, what negative outcome might result from the process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In international law and international relations, a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement.

In the case of indigenous Australians, unlike with the Māori of New Zealand, no treaty was ever entered into with the indigenous peoples entitling the Europeans to land ownership, under the doctrine of terra nullius (later overturned by Mabo v Queensland, establishing the concept of native title well after colonization was already a fait accompli). Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century, the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the UN.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were native peoples able to maintain a minimum amount of through treaties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">autonomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What indigenous people of New Zealand entered into a treaty entitling Europeans to land ownership?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Māori</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What doctrine was overturned by Mabo v Queensland establishing the concept of native title?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">terra nullius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The concept of native title was established by what court case?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mabo v Queensland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Treaties between indigenous peoples and what other groups formed an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">colonizers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1871 (ch. 120, 16 Stat. 563) had a rider (25 U.S.C. § 71) attached that effectively ended the President’s treaty making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty.
