Construction for Peter Cooper's Cooper Union Foundation building in New York began in 1853. An elevator shaft was included in the design, because Cooper was confident that a safe passenger elevator would soon be invented. The shaft was cylindrical because Cooper thought it was the most efficient design. Later, Otis designed a special elevator for the building.

An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a &quot;cage&quot;, &quot;carriage&quot; or &quot;car&quot;) mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a &quot;hoistway&quot;. In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a &quot;traction&quot; elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley, commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a counterweight. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for an elevator shaft?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hoistway</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Elevator drive mechanisms have, in the past been, powered by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the weight of the elevator cage balanced by? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a counterweight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do elevators built in pairs work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Elevator doors protect riders from falling into the shaft. The most common configuration is to have two panels that meet in the middle, and slide open laterally. In a cascading telescopic configuration (potentially allowing wider entryways within limited space), the doors roll on independent tracks so that while open, they are tucked behind one another, and while closed, they form cascading layers on one side. This can be configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above, allowing for a very wide elevator cab. In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large &quot;slab&quot; door: a single panel door the width of the doorway that opens to the left or right laterally.

Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution. The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Throughout history, what type of engines were used for elevator machines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> AC motors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were AC motors used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What problem arises for fast and large capacity elevators?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Generally, what powered the relay contoller?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MG set</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a known advantage of the MG set?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gearless traction machines are low-speed (low-RPM), high-torque electric motors powered either by AC or DC.

This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering).

The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. &quot;Traction&quot; is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What reduces the amount of force needed to propel the cab?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where will the counterweight be found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the hoist-way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What guides the traction machine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the controller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The counterweight runs equal to the cab weight plus what percentage of the elevator capacity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">40-50%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Maintaining that the ropes all have equal tension may reduce what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sheave and rope wear</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Elevators with more than 30 m (98 ft) of travel have a system called compensation.

The Glasgow Tower — an observation tower in Glasgow, Scotland — also makes use of two climbing elevators.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What defines a climbing elevator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a self-ascending elevator with its own propulsion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What settings are climbing elevators used in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">guyed masts or towers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Glasgow Tower?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an observation tower in Glasgow, Scotland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the propulsion powered in a climbing elevator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by an electric or a combustion engine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A elevator of this kind uses a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the &quot;shaft&quot; to move the cab upwards and closes the valve in order to keep the cab at the same level. a diaphragm or a piston is used as a &quot;brake&quot; if there's a sudden increase in pressure avove the cab. however, to go down, it opens the valve so that the air can pressurize the top of the &quot;shaft&quot;, allowing the cab to go down by its own weight. this also means that in case of a power failure, the cab will automatically go down. the &quot;shaft&quot; is made of acrilic, is always round, due to the shape of the vacuum pump turbine. in order to keep the air inside of the cab, rubber seals are used. due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity. they usually allow 1-3 passengers and up to 525 lbs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does this type of elevator use to propel the cage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the &quot;shaft&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For sudden surges in pressure above the cab, what is used as a &quot;brake&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a diaphragm or a piston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does it enable the cab to go down by it's own weight?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it opens the valve so that the air can pressurize the top of the &quot;shaft&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the shaft made of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acrilic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much weight is permitted on a low capacity elevator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up to 525 lbs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the first half of the twentieth century, almost all elevators had no automatic positioning of the floor on which the cab would stop.

This rheostat (see picture) was enclosed within a cylindrical container about the size and shape of a cake.

However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as &quot;soft-start&quot; contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do hydraulic elevators work in emergencies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Once the passengers have exited, what happens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what reason are hydraulic elevators not powered by the standard emergency system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are current-limiting motor starters referred to as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;soft-start&quot; contactors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Statistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the &quot;first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of elevator hold the highest safety record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cable-borne elevators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the late nineties, what was considered the rate of cable-borne elevator problems? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the severity of the majority of elevator failures recorded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">minor things such as the doors failing to open</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a maintenance-related elevator death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before the Twin Towers attack in 2001 , what was the only reported freefall accident attributed to a modern cable-borne elevator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Past problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible catastrophic failure. The code previously permitted only single-bottom hydraulic cylinders. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. One commercially available is known by the marketing name &quot;LifeJacket&quot;. This is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of hydraulic fluid, thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Underground electrolytic malfunctions in hydraulic elevators can result in the destruction of what? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the cylinder and bulkhead</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Elevator Safety Code change required a second dished bulkhead? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1972 ASME A17.1 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before the code change was enacted what was the only permitted hydraulic cylinder type?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">single-bottom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Once the cylinder is breached, what calamity does the loss of fluid cause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> uncontrolled down movement of the elevator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What testing does the code require?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">periodic testing of the pressure capability</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Safety testing of mine shaft elevator rails is routinely undertaken.

In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door. Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500 kg.

Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main function of direction lanterns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What might change your mind about whether or not to enter an elevator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of etching might you see on a direction indicator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> arrows or shaped like arrows</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some elevators may use the color convention for only what purpose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to differentiate between directions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are several technologies aimed to provide better experience to passengers suffering from claustrophobia, anthropophobia or social anxiety.

The central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system. For safety reasons, passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing. Unlike most traction elevators, the elevator car and counterweight are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity. The high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the elevator attraction at the Disney World parks across the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main feature of this attraction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do ride goers stand or sit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What unique feature does this ride provide guests?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of motor is used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high-speed drive motor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The passenger cabs are mechanically separated from the lift mechanism, thus allowing the elevator shafts to be used continuously while passengers board and embark from the cabs, as well as move through show scenes on various floors.
