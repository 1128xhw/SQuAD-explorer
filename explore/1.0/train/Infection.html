Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect. The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen, depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen. However a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection. Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of the huge amount of microorganisms, how many cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relatively few </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Interplay between pathogens and defenses of hosts results in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Infectious disease</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the severity of a disease resulting from a pathogen depend on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> ability of that pathogen to damage the host </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can a host's immune system do to a host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> cause damage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do clinicians classify infectious microorganisms according to the status of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">host defenses</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One way of proving that a given disease is &quot;infectious&quot;, is to satisfy Koch's postulates (first proposed by Robert Koch), which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls, and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis. Koch's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture. Often, even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria. For example, Treponema pallidum, the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes. It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture. Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one way of proving that a given disease is infectious?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> satisfy Koch's postulates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must an infectious agent only be identified in to satisfy the first of Koch's postulates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">patients and not in healthy controls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Koch's second postulate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">patients who contract the agent also develop the disease</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why can't Koch's postulates be applied ethically for many human diseases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the causative spirochete of syphilis? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treponema pallidum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions (e.g., influenza).

This is referred to as colonization. Most humans are not easily infected. Those who are weak, sick, malnourished, have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections. Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections. Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface, generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity, nose, eyes, genitalia, anus, or the microbe can enter through open wounds. While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry, many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs.

An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species, which colonizes the mammalian colon, and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin. Neither of these colonizations are considered infections. The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance. Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions, and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection. Some colonizing bacteria, such as Corynebacteria sp. and viridans streptococci, prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host, preventing infection and speeding wound healing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does wound colonization refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of organisms exist and injure tissue in infected wounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">replicating</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are all multcellular organisms colonized to some degree by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">extrinsic organisms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's the difference between an infection and a colonization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only a matter of circumstance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species colonizes the mammalian colon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anaerobic bacteria</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization, it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected.

In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a &quot;lawn&quot;. The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a &quot;plaque&quot;. Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Microbiological </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of medium is provided for a specific agent in a microbial culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">growth </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are most pathogenic bacteria easily grown on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nutrient agar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when a visible mound forms on the surface of a plate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a colony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a region of dead cells resulting from viral growth called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a &quot;plaque&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals.

Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected.

Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely, at some point, on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent. Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments, such as the compound light microscope, or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope. Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope, and can often rapidly lead to identification. Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques, and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques. For example, the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent (fluorescently labeled antibodies) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen. A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells.

A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background. Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells. The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well. Two methods, the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain, are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease. The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, both of which contain many significant human pathogens. The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do almost all cells readily stain with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a number of basic dyes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do cells easily stain with dyes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electrostatic attraction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What electronic charge do cellular molecules have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">negatively charged</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Geimsa stain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a dye</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many methods comprise standard approaches used to classify bacteria and diagnose disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Two </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease.

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus, as well as a myriad of other hypothesis. The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs. Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection. Thus, while there still is no cure for AIDS, there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals, both for the patient and for the community at large.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used in the treatment of AIDS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AZT </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the course of AIDS followed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> monitoring the composition of patient blood samples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could be done by understanding how the disease was transmitted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the genotypic identification of HIV later enable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">geographical origins of the virus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people before the onset of the illnes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Molecular diagnostics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Techniques like hand washing, wearing gowns, and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another.

Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Recognizing the different characteristics of various diseases is one way to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What virus' strains incapacitate their victims extremely quickly before killing them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ebola </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the initial stage of Ebola not very contagious?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">victims experience only internal hemorrhaging</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the low virulence of HIV allow victims to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">travel long distances</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks. In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method.  Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Recognizing the effects of small-world networks allows one to decrease what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">transmission rate of infectious diseases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of interactions happen within groups of infected individuals in epidemics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> extensive interactions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a way of drastically reducing infection rates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">focus is on the prevention of transmission jump</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a success implementation of preventing transmission jumps?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was vaccination used to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Resistance to infection (immunity) may be acquired following a disease, by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen, by harboring an organism with a similar structure (crossreacting), or by vaccination.

The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners, as well as laboratory scientists, immunologists, bacteriologists and other specialists.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What medical field does the treatment of infectious diseases fall into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">field of Infectious Disease</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Disease propagation can fall under the purview of what field of study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Epidemiology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tends to initially diagnose an infection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the non-medical mumbo jumbo term for pulmonologist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lung physician</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who works with both patients and general practitioners to identify a disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infectious diseases specialist</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior. Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area. This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups, which may reduce pathogen transmission, or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior, which may reduce pathogen transmission. It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates. Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate. There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load, making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism, which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections. There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load. Thus, polygny may also be due to a lower male:female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases. Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have a number of studies found a correlation between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pathogen load in an area and human behavior</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is higher pathogen load associated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does avoidance of other groups reduce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pathogen transmission</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does more restricted sexual behavior result in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Higher pathogen load </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What may poor socioeconomic factors ultimately in part be due to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high pathogen load preventing economic development.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists, scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms. Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs. When present, however, these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body. A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone. The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived, non-lethal infection. Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus. Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus, Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation. The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight, like the Herrerasaurus specimen.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What profession finds evidence of infection in fossil remains to be interesting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paleopathologists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do paleopathologists study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Signs of infection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dinosaur's skull had pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did tyrannosaurs become infected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">being bitten during a fight</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
