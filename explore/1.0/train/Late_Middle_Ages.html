A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what it was before the calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict in the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism.

The long-term effect was the virtual end of serfdom in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, landowners were able to exploit the situation to force the peasantry into even more repressive bondage.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the French Jacquerie take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1358 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What English law was enacted in order to forcibly reduce wages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Statute of Laborers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Statute of Laborers enacted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1351 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which economic system was ultimately ended by the upheavals of the 14th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">serfdom </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the English Peasants' Revolt occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1381</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Up until the mid-14th century, Europe had experienced steadily increasing urbanisation.
