In a religious sense, the Islamic Ummah refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam, referred to as Muslims. In a cultural sense, the Muslim Ummah refers to Islamic civilization, exclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization. In a modern geopolitical sense, the term &quot;Islamic Nation&quot; usually refers collectively to Muslim-majority countries, states, districts, or towns.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Islamic World is another way to refer to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When speaking of religion, what does Ummah refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those who adhere to the teachings of Islam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When speaking about culture, what does Ummah refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamic civilization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Community, or Nation are direct translations of what word in reference to Islam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ummah</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Islamic Golden Age coincided with the Middle Ages in the Muslim world, starting with the rise of Islam and establishment of the first Islamic state in 622. The end of the age is variously given as 1258 with the Mongolian Sack of Baghdad, or 1492 with the completion of the Christian Reconquista of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus, Iberian Peninsula. During the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun ar-Rashid (786 to 809), the legendary House of Wisdom was inaugurated in Baghdad where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world's knowledge into Arabic. The Abbasids were influenced by the Quranic injunctions and hadiths, such as &quot;the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr,&quot; that stressed the value of knowledge. The major Islamic capital cities of Baghdad, Cairo, and Córdoba became the main intellectual centers for science, philosophy, medicine, and education. During this period, the Muslim world was a collection of cultures; they drew together and advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Indian, Egyptian, and Phoenician civilizations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Islamic Golden age start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">622</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other age occurred at the same time as the Islamic Golden Age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Middle Ages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">There what is the latest year for the end of the Islamic Golden Age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1492</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did Abbasid caliph Harun ar-Rashid reign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">786 to 809</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the House of Wisdom held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baghdad</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Between the 8th and 18th centuries, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery. Tin-opacified glazing was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another contribution was the development of stone-paste ceramics, originating from 9th century Iraq.

The original concept is derived from a pre-Islamic Persian prototype Hezār Afsān (Thousand Fables) that relied on particular Indian elements. It reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. All Arabian fantasy tales tend to be called Arabian Nights stories when translated into English, regardless of whether they appear in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights or not. This work has been very influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor and Ali Baba.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most widely known fictional work from the Islamic world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">One Thousand and One Nights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Arabian nights was originally based upon what Persian work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hezār Afsān (Thousand Fables)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century was One Thousand and One Nights completed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did One Thousand and One Nights first get translated in the West?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first westerner to translate One Thousand and One Nights?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antoine Galland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A famous example of Arabic poetry and Persian poetry on romance (love) is Layla and Majnun, dating back to the Umayyad era in the 7th century.

Both of these narratives had protagonists (Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus) who were autodidactic feral children living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in Philosophus Autodidactus, the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in Theologus Autodidactus, developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Ibn Tufail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abubacer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Arabic book is Ibn Tufail noted for writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (Philosophus Autodidactus)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Theologus Autodidactus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ibn al-Nafis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What person wrote The Incoherence of the Philosophers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Al-Ghazali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the main chracter of Philosophus Autodidactus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hayy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Theologus Autodidactus, written by the Arabian polymath Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288), is the first example of a science fiction novel.

The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists.

Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What work is Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas known for writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did Tashrih al-badan come into being?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who theorized about pulmonary circulation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ibn al-Nafis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote The Canon of Medicine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Avicenna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Kitab al-Tasrif?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In astronomy, Muḥammad ibn Jābir al-Ḥarrānī al-Battānī improved the precision of the measurement of the precession of the Earth's axis.

The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. A variety of industrial mills were being employed in the Islamic world, including early fulling mills, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, tide mills and windmills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also invented crankshafts and water turbines, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Such advances made it possible for industrial tasks that were previously driven by manual labour in ancient times to be mechanized and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. The transfer of these technologies to medieval Europe had an influence on the Industrial Revolution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How early did people in the Muslim World start using watermills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century had mills such as gristmills and sawmills dominate the Islamic world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what point was the use of watermills common in the Muslim World?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invented crankshafts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim engineers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the inventor of water turbines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim engineers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>More than 20% of the world's population is Muslim.

Another reason why Islamic art is usually abstract is to symbolize the transcendence, indivisible and infinite nature of God, an objective achieved by arabesque.
