Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no &quot;smoking guns&quot;. Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of &quot;major combat operations&quot; in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN–USA Today–Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted &quot;democratization&quot; of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Bush feel was important to remove from power, after removing the Taliban from Kabul?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saddam Hussein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does WMD stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">weapons of mass destruction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Iraq agree to allow UN inspectors into the country to check for weapons of mass destruction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did Bush have the support of the UN, when he decided to infiltrate Iraq on March 20, 2003?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">without UN authorization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the Iraqi government and it's forces were defeated, were investigators able to locate the WMD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On March 10, 2004, Bush officially clinched the number of delegates needed to be nominated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City.

(In New York, the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the Conservative Party of New York State.) During the convention and throughout the campaign, Bush focused on two themes: defending America against terrorism and building an ownership society. The ownership society included allowing people to invest some of their Social Security in the stock market, increasing home and stock ownership, and encouraging more people to buy their own health insurance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what date did Bush obtain the number of votes required to become the 2004 Republican nominee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 10, 2004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Bush accept the Republican nomination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 2, 2004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whom did Bush want to stand beside him as Vice President?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dick Cheney</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two topics did Bush remain steadfast on, during his campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">terrorism and building an ownership society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In New York State, which party was the Bush/Cheney duo candidates of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Conservative Party</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By summer of 2003, Howard Dean had become the apparent front runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack with the largest campaign war chest. Dean's strength as a fund raiser was attributed mainly to his embrace of the Internet for campaigning. The majority of his donations came from individual supporters, who became known as Deanites, or, more commonly, Deaniacs. Generally regarded as a pragmatic centrist during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as a left-wing populist, denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them. Senator Lieberman, a liberal on domestic issues but a hawk on the War on Terror, failed to gain traction with liberal Democratic primary voters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became the Democratic nominee, half way through 2003?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Howard Dean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dean's admiration for internet campaigning accredited his strength as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a fund raiser</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Dean's backers become known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Deaniacs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What government position has Howard Dean previously held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">governor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Bush's policies did Dean criticize most notably?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 2003 invasion of Iraq</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In September 2003, retired four-star general Wesley Clark announced his intention to run in the presidential primary election for the Democratic Party nomination.

Kerry's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager Jim Jordan. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy assigned Mary Beth Cahill to be the campaign manager, as well as Kerry's mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the &quot;magical&quot; Michael Whouley who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for Al Gore in 2000 against Bill Bradley.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had the least amount of backers, between Kerry and Dean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kerry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which state was expected to show the least amount of support for Kerry going into the caucuses, before Iowa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Hampshire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What act showed that Kerry's fight for the White House was in trouble?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he fired campaign manager Jim Jordan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took over for Jim Jordon, when he was fired?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mary Beth Cahill</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What regulation did Kerry not follow to try to save his campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the race for individual contributions, economist Lyndon LaRouche dominated the pack leading up to the primaries.

To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion. The incessant replaying of the &quot;Dean Scream&quot; by the press became a debate on the topic of whether Dean was the victim of media bias. The scream scene was shown approximately 633 times by cable and broadcast news networks in just four days following the incident, a number that does not include talk shows and local news broadcasts.

In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with, &quot;I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.&quot; He later delivered what may have been the speech's most memorable line when he said, &quot;the future doesn't belong to fear, it belongs to freedom&quot;, a quote that later appeared in a Kerry/Edwards television advertisement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did John Kerry choose to be by his side as the potential Vice President?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> John Edwards</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many candidates did John Kerry name as potential prospects to be his running mate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Kerry/Edwards slogan that was released prior to the start of the convention in Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;stronger at home and more respected in the world.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of Kerry's Boston speech made reference to his military experience?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which famous line from Kerry's speech was later featured in one of his later television ad campaigns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;the future doesn't belong to fear, it belongs to freedom&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bush focused his campaign on national security, presenting himself as a decisive leader and contrasted Kerry as a &quot;flip-flopper.&quot; This strategy was designed to convey to American voters the idea that Bush could be trusted to be tough on terrorism while Kerry would be &quot;uncertain in the face of danger.&quot; Bush (just as his father did with Dukakis in the 1988 election) also sought to portray Kerry as a &quot;Massachusetts liberal&quot; who was out of touch with mainstream Americans.

It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared (New Mexico and Iowa), would decide the winner. Bush had established a lead of around 130,000 votes but the Democrats pointed to provisional ballots that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000. Bush had preliminary leads of less than 5% of the vote in only four states, but if Iowa, Nevada and New Mexico had all eventually gone to Kerry, a win for Bush in Ohio would have created a 269–269 tie in the Electoral College. The result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population. Such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for Bush, as Republicans controlled more House delegations. Therefore, the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio, regardless of the final totals elsewhere. In the afternoon Ohio's Secretary of State, Ken Blackwell, announced that it was statistically impossible for the Democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win. At the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140,000 (and later estimated to be only 135,000). Faced with this announcement, John Kerry conceded defeat. Had Kerry won Ohio, he would have won the election despite losing the national popular vote by over 3 million votes, a complete reversal of the 2000 election when Bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore by over 500,000 votes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was there tension the day after the election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared (New Mexico and Iowa), would decide the winner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Despite an apparent lead by Bush early on, what was thought to be a concern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">provisional ballots that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How would it be determined who would win, in the event of an electoral tie?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which state became the most important to secure Bush's presidential election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Bush lose the popular vote to in the 2000 election for presidency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Al Gore</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the official counting of the electoral votes on January 6, a motion was made contesting Ohio's electoral votes.
