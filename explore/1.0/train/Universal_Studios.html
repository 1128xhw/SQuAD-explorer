(also known as Universal Pictures) is an American film studio, owned by Comcast through its wholly owned subsidiary NBCUniversal, and is one of Hollywood's &quot;Big Six&quot; film studios. Its production studios are at 100 Universal City Plaza Drive in Universal City, California. Distribution and other corporate offices are in New York City. Universal Studios is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Universal was founded in 1912 by the German Carl Laemmle (pronounced &quot;LEM-lee&quot;), Mark Dintenfass, Charles O. Baumann, Adam Kessel, Pat Powers, William Swanson, David Horsley, Robert H.

One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours, counting patrons and calculating the day's takings. Within weeks of his Chicago trip, Laemmle gave up dry goods to buy the first several nickelodeons. For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs, the creation in 1908 of the Edison-backed Motion Picture Trust meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed. Based on the Latham Loop used in cameras and projectors, along with other patents, the Trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition, and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After a trip to what city did Carl Laemmle leave the dry goods business?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chicago </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Motion Picture Trust created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1908</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What notable historical figure was involved in the Motion Picture Trust?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edison</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what part of a motion picture projector did the Motion Picture Trust hold a patent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Latham Loop</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Soon, Laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying Edison by producing their own pictures. In June 1909, Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners Abe Stern and Julius Stern. That company quickly evolved into the Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP), with studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where many early films in America's first motion picture industry were produced in the early 20th century. Laemmle broke with Edison's custom of refusing to give billing and screen credits to performers. By naming the movie stars, he attracted many of the leading players of the time, contributing to the creation of the star system. In 1910, he promoted Florence Lawrence, formerly known as &quot;The Biograph Girl&quot;, and actor King Baggot, in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company did Laemmle found in June 1909?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yankee Film Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were Laemmle's business partners in the Yankee Film Company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abe Stern and Julius Stern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city and state was the Independent Moving Pictures Company based?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fort Lee, New Jersey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a nickname of Florence Lawrence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Biograph Girl</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What actor did Laemmle promote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Baggot</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Universal Film Manufacturing Company was incorporated in New York on April 30, 1912.

Unlike other movie moguls, Laemmle opened his studio to tourists. Universal became the largest studio in Hollywood, and remained so for a decade.

Unlike rivals Adolph Zukor, William Fox, and Marcus Loew, Laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain. He also financed all of his own films, refusing to take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director Erich von Stroheim insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films Blind Husbands (1919) and Foolish Wives (1922), but Universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational ad campaign that attracted moviegoers. Character actor Lon Chaney became a drawing card for Universal in the 1920s, appearing steadily in dramas. His two biggest hits for Universal were The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925). During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to Irving Thalberg. Thalberg had been Laemmle's personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated. Promoted to studio chief, Thalberg was giving Universal's product a touch of class, but MGM's head of production Louis B. Mayer lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay. Without his guidance Universal became a second-tier studio, and would remain so for several decades.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who directed Blind Husbands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Erich von Stroheim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Foolish Wives produced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1922</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who starred in The Phantom of the Opera?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lon Chaney</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year saw a film version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1923</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was at one time Laemmle's personal secretary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Irving Thalberg</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of Joe Pasternak.

With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles.

When one of those films, Winchester '73, proved to be a hit, the arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at Universal, and eventually at other studios as well.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a notable talent agent circa 1950?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lew Wasserman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What star did Lew Wasserman represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Stewart</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What actor featured in Winchester '73?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Stewart</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What legal decision resulted in movie studios letting their contract actors go?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. vs. Paramount Pictures, et al.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the late 1950s, the motion picture business was again changing. The combination of the studio/theater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the reduced audience size for cinema productions. The Music Corporation of America (MCA), then predominately a talent agency, had also become a powerful television producer, renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Productions subsidiary. After a period of complete shutdown, a moribund Universal agreed to sell its 360-acre (1.5 km²) studio lot to MCA in 1958, for $11 million, renamed Revue Studios. MCA owned the studio lot, but not Universal Pictures, yet was increasingly influential on Universal's product. The studio lot was upgraded and modernized, while MCA clients like Doris Day, Lana Turner, Cary Grant, and director Alfred Hitchcock were signed to Universal Pictures contracts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What acronym was the Music Corporation of America known by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MCA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did MCA's Revue Productions subsidiary rent space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Republic Studios</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In square kilometers, how large was the lot Universal sold to MCA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.5</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Universal sell its 360-acre lot to MCA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1958</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did MCA pay for Universal's 360-acre lot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$11 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The long-awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA, Inc. happened in mid-1962 as part of the MCA-Decca Records merger. The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons. An innovation during this period championed by Universal was the made-for-television movie.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did MCA take over Universal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1962 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company did MCA create in 1964?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Universal City Studios, Inc.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new name was given to Revue Productions in 1966?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Universal Television</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the company formed by the merger of Universal and NBC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">NBC Universal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Universal inaugurate its studio tour subsidiary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1964</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At this time, Hal B.

Though Universal did produce occasional hits, among them Airport (1970), The Sting (1973), American Graffiti (also 1973), Earthquake (1974), and a big box-office success which restored the company's fortunes: Jaws (1975), Universal during the decade was primarily a television studio. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased United Artists in 1981, MGM could not drop out of the CIC venture to merge with United Artists overseas operations. However, with future film productions from both names being released through the MGM/UA Entertainment plate, CIC decided to merge UA's international units with MGM and reformed as United International Pictures. There would be other film hits like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Back to the Future (1985), Field of Dreams (1989), and Jurassic Park (1993), but the film business was financially unpredictable. UIP began distributing films by start-up studio DreamWorks in 1997, due to connections the founders have with Paramount, Universal, and Amblin Entertainment. In 2001, MGM dropped out of the UIP venture, and went with 20th Century Fox's international arm to handle distribution of their titles to this day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who partnered with Universal in the creation of Cinema International Corporation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paramount Pictures</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the film Airport made?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Universal hit film was produced in 1974?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Earthquake</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company was purchased by MGM in 1981?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Artists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did United International Pictures start distributing films for DreamWorks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Anxious to expand the company's broadcast and cable presence, longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner.
