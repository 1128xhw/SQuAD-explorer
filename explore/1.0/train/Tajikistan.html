The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid Empire, Sassanian Empire, Hephthalite Empire, Samanid Empire, Mongol Empire, Timurid dynasty, and the Russian Empire. As a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan became an independent nation in 1991. A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence, lasting from 1992 to 1997. Since the end of the war, newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country's economy to grow.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some of the empires and dynasties that have also ruled over this land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Achaemenid Empire, Sassanian Empire, Hephthalite Empire, Samanid Empire, Mongol Empire, Timurid dynasty, and the Russian Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other culutres has ruled the area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oxus civilization, Andronovo culture, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the territory of Tajikistan during the Neolithic and the Bronze Age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> city of Sarazm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Tajikistan become an independent nation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did the civil war take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992 to 1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were some of the different kindoms and people that called Tajikistan home?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oxus civilization, Andronovo culture, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some of the empires and dynasties that ruled this lane?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Achaemenid Empire, Sassanian Empire, Hephthalite Empire, Samanid Empire, Mongol Empire, Timurid dynasty, and the Russian Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Tajikistan become an independant nation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did the war last through?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992 to 1997</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tajiks began to be conscripted into the Soviet Army in 1939 and during World War II around 260,000 Tajik citizens fought against Germany, Finland and Japan. Between 60,000(4%) and 120,000(8%) of Tajikistan's 1,530,000 citizens were killed during World War II. Following the war and Stalin's reign attempts were made to further expand the agriculture and industry of Tajikistan. During 1957–58 Nikita Khrushchev's Virgin Lands Campaign focused attention on Tajikistan, where living conditions, education and industry lagged behind the other Soviet Republics. In the 1980s, Tajikistan had the lowest household saving rate in the USSR, the lowest percentage of households in the two top per capita income groups, and the lowest rate of university graduates per 1000 people. By the late 1980s Tajik nationalists were calling for increased rights. Real disturbances did not occur within the republic until 1990. The following year, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Tajikistan declared its independence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Tajiks start being part of the Soviet Army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1939 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Tajik troops fought against Germany, Finland and Japan during WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 260,000 Tajik</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of Tajiks were killed during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Between 60,000(4%) and 120,000(8%)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was not developing as fast as other Soviet Republics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> living conditions, education and industry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were the different factions distinguished from eachother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> by clan loyalties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the ceasefire guaranteed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who came into power in 1992?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Emomali Rahmon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did more than half a million people flee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Russian border troops were stationed along the Tajik–Afghan border until summer 2005.

Drug money corrupts the country's government; according to some experts the well-known personalities that fought on both sides of the civil war and have held the positions in the government after the armistice was signed are now involved in the drug trade. UNODC is working with Tajikistan to strengthen border crossings, provide training, and set up joint interdiction teams. It also helped to establish Tajikistani Drug Control Agency.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is raised locally for the domestic market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opium poppy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What all has helped with the fight against drugs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with the increasing assistance from international organizations, such as UNODC, and cooperation with the US, Russian, EU and Afghan authorities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tajikistan is thrid in the world for what type of confiscations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> heroin and raw opium confiscations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is UNODC helping Tajikistan with to help the war on drugs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strengthen border crossings, provide training, and set up joint interdiction teams.
