Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is &quot;a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions&quot; (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the &quot;situated self&quot; to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions).[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The central task for psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists is to describe what topics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individual and group identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the ISA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Weinreich</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">ISA stands for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Identity Structure Analysis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Weinreich's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion, foreclosure and crisis, but with a somewhat different emphasis. Here, with respect to identity diffusion for example, an optimal level is interpreted as the norm, as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused, and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive. (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson, 2003, pp 65–67; 105-106). Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example, an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state, whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another. Hence, though there is continuity, there is also development and change.

The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works. In the same way as Barth, in his approach to ethnicity, advocated the critical focus for investigation as being &quot;the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses&quot; (1969:15), social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification. If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built. They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group has shifted the focus of research in identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anthropologists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a researcher have to identify to carry out empirical research?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an appropriate analytical tool</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What researcher advocated for focus on the boundaries of ethnic groups rather than the cultural aspects of ethnic groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If identity is a virtual site, what do boundaries supply to the virtual site?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the framework</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Boundaries are frequently used by researchers to help define what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The inclusiveness of Weinreich's definition (above) directs attention to the totality of one's identity at a given phase in time, and assists in elucidating component aspects of one's total identity, such as one's gender identity, ethnic identity, occupational identity and so on.

This was reinforced by an appreciation, following the trend in sociological thought, of the manner in which the individual is affected by and contributes to the overall social context. At the same time, the Eriksonian approach to identity remained in force, with the result that identity has continued until recently to be used in a largely socio-historical way to refer to qualities of sameness in relation to a person's connection to others and to a particular group of people.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term have Anthropologists employed to refer to the Eriksonian idea of selfhood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970's led what group to be more interested in identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anthropologists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Until recently, what approach was used to refer to qualities of sameness in relation to a person's connection to others?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Eriksonian approach</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other hand, those who do understand the newcomer's language could take it as an inclusive boundary, through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present. Equally, however, it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary. It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this, depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two types of group boundaries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inclusive or exclusive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A marker that imposes restriction on the behavior of others is what kind of boundary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exclusive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A marker that people are ready and willing to associate with is what kind of boundary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inclusive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What boundary is given as an example that can be inclusive or exclusive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">language</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The &quot;Neo-Eriksonian&quot; identity status paradigm emerged in later years[when?], driven largely by the work of James Marcia.

This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or &quot;dirty work&quot; (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that &quot;individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a &quot;preferred organizational self&quot; (Tracy &amp; Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of &quot;glorified maids&quot; (Tracy &amp; Tretheway 2005). &quot;The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.&quot; Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy &amp; Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. &quot;Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered &quot;dirty&quot; by societal standards&quot; (Tracy &amp; Scott 2006, p. 7). &quot;In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. &quot;If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity&quot; (Tracy &amp; Scott 2006, p. 33).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Various research traditions are using what lens to examine phenomena?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the lens of identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What stigma do correctional officers have to deal with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glorified maids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The implications of identity and identity construction are discussed in what settings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">occupational settings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are people in stigmatized jobs forced to create?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an identity they can live with</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two examples give for justifications and values for occupational choices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, the formation of one's identity occurs through one's identifications with significant others (primarily with parents and other individuals during one's biographical experiences, and also with &quot;groups&quot; as they are perceived).

Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past, but seems willing to commit to some relevant values, goals, or roles in the future. Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness, ready to make choices but unable to commit to them. Finally, achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What may a person display in terms of both exploration and commitments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relative weakness or relative strength</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the permutation when a person lacks exploration and commitment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identity diffusion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the permutation when a person has not chosen goals in the past but is willing to in the future?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identity foreclosure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the permutation when a person is ready to make commitments but unable to commit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identity moratorium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the permutation when a person commits to identity choices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identity achievement</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>These different explorations of 'identity' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down. Since identity is a virtual thing, it is impossible to define it empirically. Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings, from fundamental and abiding sameness, to fluidity, contingency, negotiated and so on. Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis (Brubaker &amp; Cooper 2000, p. 5). Indeed, many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity, following more or less the frameworks listed above, rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality. In this environment, some analysts, such as Brubaker and Cooper, have suggested doing away with the concept completely (Brubaker &amp; Cooper 2000, p. 1). Others, by contrast, have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression. Hall (1992, 1996), for example, suggests treating identity as a process, to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience. Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification, whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified' and interpreted by individuals. The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with. Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many scholars confuse identity as a category of practice and what other category?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">category of analysis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do many scholars demonstrate a tendency towards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their own preconceptions of identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The idea that identity is made of components that are identified by individuals is what idea? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the idea of identification</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some scholars try to introduce new concepts to capture the fluid qualities of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">human social self-expression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it impossible to do with identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">define it empirically</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gender identity forms an important part of identity in psychology, as it dictates to a significant degree how one views oneself both as a person and in relation to other people, ideas and nature. Other aspects of identity, such as racial, religious, ethnic, occupational… etc. may also be more or less significant – or significant in some situations but not in others (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson 2003 pp26–34).

The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity, known as the ego identity (sometimes identified simply as &quot;the self&quot;); the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next, known as the personal identity; and the collection of social roles that a person might play, known as either the social identity or the cultural identity. Erikson's work, in the psychodynamic tradition, aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan. Progressive strength in the ego identity, for example, can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges. The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task, and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed' identities (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson 2003 p7-8). On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion (Cote &amp; Levine 2002, p. 22).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Erik Erikson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What distinction is sometimes referred to as the self?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ego identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The personal idiosyncrasies that separate individuals are called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the personal identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the 3 names for the collection of a person's social roles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the social identity or the cultural identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what tradition is Erikson's work to track identity formation throughout a lifetime?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the psychodynamic tradition</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Laing's definition of identity closely follows Erikson's, in emphasising the past, present and future components of the experienced self.

(Saunderson and O'Kane, 2005). Harré also conceptualises components of self/identity – the &quot;person&quot; (the unique being I am to myself and others) along with aspects of self (including a totality of attributes including beliefs about one's characteristics including life history), and the personal characteristics displayed to others.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose definition of identity closely follows Erikson's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Laing's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">One person's perception of another's perception is an example of what concept?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metaperspective of self</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The person, aspects of self, and personal characteristics displayed to others are components of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self/identity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications, which include the strategic manipulator, the pastiche personality, and the relational self. The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises, and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social &quot;self&quot;. The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or &quot;essential&quot; identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play. Finally, the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others. For Gergen, these strategies follow one another in phases, and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who formulated the classifications of strategic manipulator, pastiche personality and the relational self?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kenneth Gergen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what classification is a person who regards all experiences are role play and becomes alienated from his or her social self?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The strategic manipulator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what classification is a person who gives up the chance for a true self and adopts social perceptions of him or herself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The pastiche personality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what classification is a person who gives up their exclusive sense of self and defines him or herself only in terms of social engagement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the relational self</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The strategic manipulator, pastiche personality, and relational self are linked to the rise of what culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">postmodern culture</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool, the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people's experiences of the self in society. While identity is a volatile, flexible and abstract 'thing', its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view. Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language, dress, behaviour and choice of space, whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings. Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers, their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning. In a social context, misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers. Equally, an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concept helps map and define people's experiences of self in society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the concept of boundaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a volatile, flexible, and abstract thing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Language, dress, behavior, and choice of space are affected by recognition by what group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">other social beings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do markers help create?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">boundaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Markers can be used to exert what on other people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">influence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
