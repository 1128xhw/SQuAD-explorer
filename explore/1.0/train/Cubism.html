A primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name the 8 peopl who began the movement</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger and Juan Gris.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which person  was the most influential in beginning the movement with is three dimensional forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Paul Cézanne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year's were Cezannes painting's displayed at Salon d'Automne?

Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 Houses at L’Estaque (and related works) prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to refer to bizarreries cubiques (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as Reservoir at Horta de Ebro, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between what years did cubism begin? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1907 and 1911</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the spring of what year did the first organized exhibition by cubist appear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1911 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the room that the first exhibition of Cubists took place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Salle 41</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who mentioned the landscapes made by Picasso in the first Cubist paintings? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gertrude Stein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city did the first exhibition of Cubists take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historians have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as Analytic Cubism, a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori, was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, Synthetic Cubism, remained vital until around 1919, when the Surrealist movement gained popularity. English art historian Douglas Cooper proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, The Cubist Epoch. According to Cooper there was &quot;Early Cubism&quot;, (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called &quot;High Cubism&quot;, (from 1909 to 1914) during which time Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to &quot;Late Cubism&quot; (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical avant-garde movement. Douglas Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first phase of Cubism known as? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Analytic Cubism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who coined the phrase Analytic Cubsim? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Juan Gris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the second phase of Cubism called? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Synthetic Cubism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what years did High Cubism take place? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1909 to 1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what years did Late Cubism take place? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1914 to 1921</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as early as 1920, but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by Clement Greenberg. Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the &quot;Salle 41&quot; Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the &quot;Salle 41&quot; artists, e.g., Francis Picabia; the brothers Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the Section d'Or (or the Puteaux Group); the sculptors Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine as well as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis, Roger de La Fresnaye, František Kupka, Diego Rivera, Léopold Survage, Auguste Herbin, André Lhote, Gino Severini (after 1916), María Blanchard (after 1916) and Georges Valmier (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were &quot;later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who asserted that the flat canvas supported Cubism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the assertion made that the flat canvas supported Cubism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> early as 1920</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the assertion that the flat canvas supported Cubism put into debate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950s and 1960s, </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the main opponent that began to argue that the flat canvas did not support Cubism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Clement Greenberg. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's work undermined Douglass  Coopers terms describing Cubism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans were discovering African, Polynesian, Micronesian and Native American art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through Gertrude Stein, at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and African tribal masks. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as Protocubism, as notably seen in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, the antecedent of Cubism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which artists in the early 19th and 20th century inspired by the newly discovered African, Native American, Micro and Polynesian art?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What about the Native cultures art inspired Matisse, Picasso, and Gauguin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stark power and simplicity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Picasso meet around 1906 that had also recenelty learned about Primitivism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Gertrude Stein,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Picasso's 1907 paintings usually characterized by? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protocubism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The art historian Douglas Cooper states that Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne &quot;were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907&quot;. Cooper goes on to say: &quot;The Demoiselles is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the Demoiselles is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two artists did Douglass Cooper say were very important to the forming of Cubism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Cooper say is the first  Cubist picture? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Demoiselles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is it true that the first Cubist picture is The Demoiselles? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most serious objection to regarding the Demoiselles as the origin of Cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that &quot;such deductions are unhistorical&quot;, wrote the art historian Daniel Robbins. This familiar explanation &quot;fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed.&quot; Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both Les Nabis and the Symbolists (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. Neo-Impressionist structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of Georges Seurat (e.g., Parade de Cirque, Le Chahut and Le Cirque), was another important influence.

However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides Seurat where else are the beginnigs of Cubism found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Cubists exploration of the concept of the simplification of forms into cones cylinders and spheres was further explored by whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cézanne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Cubism revolutionized the way things could be seen in art how? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of Guillaume Apollinaire.

Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify.

The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published Du &quot;Cubisme&quot; in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris). Clarifying their aims as artists, this work was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible. The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in Puteaux and Courbevoie. It mirrored the attitudes of the &quot;artists of Passy&quot;, which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication. The concept developed in Du &quot;Cubisme&quot; of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the term Cubism become used more?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1911</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which poet critic in 1911 with a group of poets accepted the term Cubism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guillaume Apollinaire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The artists of Passy included which two people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Picabia and the Duchamp brothers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There was a distinct difference between Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists.

Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy.

Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled Simultaneous Windows, followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes (1913), writing of a new &quot;pure&quot; painting in which the subject was vacated.

The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of simultaneity, drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, Charles Henry, Maurice Princet, and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. Linear perspective developed during the Renaissance was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Du Cubisme who so Metzinger and Gleizes  relate the sense of time to? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Henri Bergson </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Cubist used what kind of treatment of space and time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> The Salon Cubists </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or relative motion) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing), exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier’s Abundance shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's City of Paris, shown at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s The Wedding, also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force.

Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American Stuart Davis and the Englishman Ben Nicholson. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler’s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before what year was Cubism considered the most innovative? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With the assistance of what dealer did Cubism return as  a central consideration for artists after World War I?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Léonce Rosenberg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Rosenberg exhibit Cubist works at  Galerie de l’Effort Moderne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1918 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which city did Galerie de l’Effort Moderne take place? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The reemergence of Cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes.

Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards conservatism in both French society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition.

Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two things did Cubism in the early 20th century form an important link between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">art and architecture.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the four formal characteristics that are usually connected with Cubism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which four countries were the impacts of avant garde art particularly strong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> France, Germany, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Architectural interest in Cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective. Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (La Maison Cubiste, by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as Peter Behrens and Walter Gropius, with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Cubism what was architechtural interested base on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said that Cubism was becoming an influetial aspect in modern architecture ? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Increased use of what material marked Cubism influence in architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glass</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of &quot;a profound reorientation towards a changed world&quot;. The Cubo-Futurist ideas of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential De Stijl movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by Piet Mondrian under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by Gino Severini to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of Purism, Amédée Ozenfant and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier,) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published Après le cubisme in 1918. Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The ideas of which Cubo Futurist influenced the avant-garde in architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Filippo Tommaso Marinetti </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The De Stijl movement took part in the aesthetic principles of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Neo-plasticism </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed Neo Plasticism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Piet Mondrian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who linked De Stijl to Cubist theory? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gino Severini</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Le Corbusier open his Paris studio with in 1922?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his cousin Jeanneret</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;, written during the assemblage of the &quot;Maison Cubiste&quot;, wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the &quot;antithesis of the picture&quot;. &quot;The true picture&quot; wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, &quot;bears its raison d'être within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...&quot;. &quot;Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence&quot;, writes Christopher Green, &quot;creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye&quot;. La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art décoratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled &quot;Facade architectural, plaster&quot; (Façade architecturale).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How big was the model of La Maison Cubiste? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10-by-3-meter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Metzinger piece was hung in La Maison Cubiste?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Woman with a Fan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was La Maison Cubiste ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a fully furnished house</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The original Cubist architecture is very rare. There is only one country in the world where Cubism was really applied to architecture – namely Bohemia (today Czech Republic) and especially its capital, Prague. Czech architects were the first and only ones in the world to ever design original Cubist buildings. Cubist architecture flourished for the most part between 1910–1914, but the Cubist or Cubism-influenced buildings were also built after the World War I. After the war, the architectural style called Rondo-Cubism was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is original Cubist architecture rare?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cubist architecture is very rare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country applied Cubism to architecture the most?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bohemia (today Czech Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was for the form of architectural Cubism in Prague called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rondo-Cubism </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called diamond cut, or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late Gothic architecture. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. hexagonal windows. Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the essential piece Cubist architects explained in their theoretical rules? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dynamism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's  window shapes di Czech Cubist architects use? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hexagonal </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What feelings should Cubist architecture evoke in viewer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dynamism and expressive plasticity </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The leading Cubist architects were Pavel Janák, Josef Gočár, Vlastislav Hofman, Emil Králíček and Josef Chochol.

This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada.&quot; Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of Dada and Surrealism was profound; Louis Aragon, founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was &quot;our immediate elder, the exemplary poet.&quot; Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets John Ashbery and Ron Padgett have recently produced new translations of Reverdy's work. Wallace Stevens' &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird&quot; is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which poets are closely alligned with Cubism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guillaume Apollinaire, Blaise Cendrars, Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, André Salmon and Pierre Reverdy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the american Poet who is associated with talking about the rigiorous architecture of Cubism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kenneth Rexroth </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two American poets have recently created new traslations of Reverdy's work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Ashbery and Ron Padgett</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Wallace Steven's work that explains how cubism can be translated into poetry? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
