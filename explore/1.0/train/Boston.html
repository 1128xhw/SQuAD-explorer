Boston also served as the historic county seat of Suffolk County until Massachusetts disbanded county government in 1999. The city proper covers 48 square miles (124 km2) with an estimated population of 655,884 in 2014, making it the largest city in New England and the 24th largest city in the United States. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called Greater Boston, home to 4.7 million people and the tenth-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country. Greater Boston as a commuting region is home to 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest combined statistical area in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the capital of Massachusetts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the approximate population for 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">655,884</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many square miles does Boston cover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">48 square miles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of Boston in 2014</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">655,884</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many square miles is Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">48 square miles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What place is Boston in for largest city in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of the United States is Boston located in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Massachusetts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many square miles is the city proper of Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">48</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The large metropolitan area of Boston is also called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greater Boston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the estimated population of Greater Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4.7 million people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the capital and largest city in Massachusetts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boston</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One of the oldest cities in the United States, Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England.

Upon American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub, as well as a center for education and culture. Through land reclamation and municipal annexation, Boston has expanded beyond the original peninsula. Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing over 20 million visitors per year.

Their settlement was initially limited to the Shawmut Peninsula, at that time surrounded by the Massachusetts Bay and Charles River and connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus.

Until the early 20th century, Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories.

In the latter half of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settled in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants—Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and since the early 20th century, the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics—prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F.

The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown. After The Great Boston Fire of 1872, workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront. During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600 acres (2.4 km2) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of Boston Common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights.

The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized into a mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments from 1984 to 1990. By the 1970s, the city's economy boomed after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston's Back Bay during this time period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s and later began again. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as Boston College, Boston University, the Harvard Medical School, Northeastern University, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Berklee College of Music and Boston Conservatory attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing, which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the first community health center in the US open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Colombia Point Health Center located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dorchester neighborhood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1990, the Colombia Point Health Center was renamed what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Boston is an intellectual, technological, and political center but has lost some important regional institutions, including the acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times, and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati–based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities.

Downtown and its immediate surroundings consists largely of low-rise (often Federal style and Greek Revival) masonry buildings, interspersed with modern highrises, notably in the Financial District, Government Center, and South Boston. Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks, such as the Boston Public Library, Christian Science Center, Copley Square, Newbury Street, and New England's two tallest buildings—the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center. Near the John Hancock Tower is the old John Hancock Building with its prominent illuminated beacon, the color of which forecasts the weather. Smaller commercial areas are interspersed among areas of single-family homes and wooden/brick multi-family row houses. The South End Historic District is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighborhood in the US. The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly impacted by the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (known unofficially as the &quot;Big Dig&quot;), which allowed for the removal of the unsightly elevated Central Artery and the incorporation of new green spaces and open areas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of Inner Bostons land area did not exist when the city was founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">More than two-thirds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The modern land area was created by the gradual filling in of surrounding what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tidal areas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tremont Street is named after what original hill in Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Trimountain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A train full of gravel came from Needham to fill what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Back Bay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Boston Public Library is located in what part of Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Back Bay</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Boston has a continental climate with some maritime influence, and using the −3 °C (27 °F) coldest month (January) isotherm, the city lies within the transition zone from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) to a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), although the suburbs north and west of the city are significantly colder in winter and solidly fall under the latter categorization; the city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 73.4 °F (23.0 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean of 29.0 °F (−1.7 °C). Periods exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each, respectively. The most recent sub-0 °F (−18 °C) reading occurring on February 14, 2016 when the temperature dipped down to −9 °F (−23 °C), the coldest reading since 1957. In addition, several decades may pass between 100 °F (38 °C) readings, with the most recent such occurrence on July 22, 2011 when the temperature reached 103 °F (39 °C). The city's average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5.[c] Official temperature records have ranged from −18 °F (−28 °C) on February 9, 1934, up to 104 °F (40 °C) on July 4, 1911; the record cold daily maximum is 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on August 2, 1975.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most of the city lies in which USDA plant hardiness zone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6b</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What minimizes the influence of the Atlantic ocean on Bostons weather?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prevailing wind patterns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the hottest month in Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the coldest month in Boston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Boston's coastal location on the North Atlantic moderates its temperature, but makes the city very prone to Nor'easter weather systems that can produce much snow and rain.

Thunderstorms occur from May to September, that are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours.
