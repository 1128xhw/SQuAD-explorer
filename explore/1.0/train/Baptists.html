Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, elders and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What individuals subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baptists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation what examples of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tenets of Baptist churches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two ministerial offices do Baptists recognize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elders and deacons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Baptist churches are widely considered to be what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestant churches</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historians trace the earliest church labeled &quot;Baptist&quot; back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor.

Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings.

Reared in the Church of England, he became &quot;Puritan, English Separatist, and then a Baptist Separatist,&quot; and ended his days working with the Mennonites. He began meeting in England with 60–70 English Separatists, in the face of &quot;great danger.&quot; The persecution of religious nonconformists in England led Smyth to go into exile in Amsterdam with fellow Separatists from the congregation he had gathered in Lincolnshire, separate from the established church (Anglican). Smyth and his lay supporter, Thomas Helwys, together with those they led, broke with the other English exiles because Smyth and Helwys were convinced they should be baptized as believers. In 1609 Smyth first baptized himself and then baptized the others.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Historians trace the earliest Baptist church back to when?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1609</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Historians trace the earliest Baptist church back to where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amsterdam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the pastor of the earliest Baptist church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Smyth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John Smyth broke his ties with what church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Church of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did John Smyth go into exile?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amsterdam</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1609, while still there, Smyth wrote a tract titled &quot;The Character of the Beast,&quot; or &quot;The False Constitution of the Church.&quot; In it he expressed two propositions: first, infants are not to be baptized; and second, &quot;Antichristians converted are to be admitted into the true Church by baptism.&quot; Hence, his conviction was that a scriptural church should consist only of regenerate believers who have been baptized on a personal confession of faith. He rejected the Separatist movement's doctrine of infant baptism (paedobaptism). Shortly thereafter, Smyth left the group, and layman Thomas Helwys took over the leadership, leading the church back to England in 1611.

Historically, Baptists have played a key role in encouraging religious freedom and separation of church and state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Baptists are defined by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">doctrine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Baptists have issued what without considering them to be creeds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">confessions of faith</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most Baptists are what in doctrine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evangelical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Baptists have played a key role in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">encouraging religious freedom and separation of church and state.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth; miracles; atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Jesus; the Trinity; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God, his death and resurrection, and confession of Christ as Lord); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth, the dead will be raised, and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions.

Baptist historian Walter Shurden says the word &quot;crisis&quot; comes from the Greek word meaning &quot;to decide.&quot; Shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises, some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be &quot;positive and highly productive.&quot; He claims that even schism, though never ideal, has often produced positive results. In his opinion crises among Baptists each have become decision-moments that shaped their future. Some controversies that have shaped Baptists include the &quot;missions crisis&quot;, the &quot;slavery crisis&quot;, the &quot;landmark crisis&quot;, and the &quot;modernist crisis&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">&quot;Crisis&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to decide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote that some controversies reach a crisis level may actually be &quot;positive and highly productive?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Walter Shurden</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Shurden claim was never ideal, has often produced positive results?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">controversies that have shaped Baptists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some controversies that have shaped Baptists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;missions crisis&quot;, the &quot;slavery crisis&quot;, the &quot;landmark crisis&quot;, and the &quot;modernist crisis&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Leading up to the American Civil War, Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over slavery in the United States. Whereas in the First Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the Board did not want to appear to condone slavery.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Baptists become embroiled in the controversy over slavery in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leading up to the American Civil War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Methodist and Baptist preachers oppose slavery and urge manumission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the First Great Awakening</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paternalistic institution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What denomination allowed blacks active roles in the congregation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Baptists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Home Mission Society</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As early as the late 18th century, black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies, especially in the northern states. Not only did blacks set up some independent congregations in the South before the American Civil War, freedmen quickly separated from white congregations and associations after the war. They wanted to be free of white supervision. In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the National Baptist Convention. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second largest Baptist organization in the world. Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast. In 2007, the Pew Research Center's Religious Landscape Survey found that 45% of all African-Americans identify with Baptist denominations, with the vast majority of those being within the historically black tradition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">As early as the late 18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who separated from white congregations and associations after the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">freedmen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wanted to be free from white submission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">freedmen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What states setup black conventions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of all African-Americans identify with Baptist denominations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">45%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Elsewhere in the Americas, in the Caribbean in particular, Baptist missionaries took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. In Jamaica, for example, William Knibb, a prominent British Baptist missionary, worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the British West Indies (which took place in 1838). Knibb also protagonised the creation of &quot;Free Villages&quot;; rural communities centred around a Baptist church where emancipated slaves could farm their own land. Baptists were likewise active in promoting the education of former slaves; for example, Jamaica's Calabar High School, named after the slave port of Calabar, was formed by Baptist missionaries. At the same time, during and after slavery, slaves and free formed their own Spiritual Baptist movements - breakaway spiritual movements which often expressed resistance to oppression.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Baptist missionaries take an active role in the anti-slavery movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Caribbean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a prominent British Baptist missionary in Jamaica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Knibb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did William Knibb work toward the emancipation of slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the British West Indies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Knibb also protagonised the creation of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Free Villages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was named after the slave port of Calabar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jamaica's Calabar High School</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 20 June 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery.
