In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's &quot;Metro&quot; design language, the Start screen (which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles), a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on touchscreen input, integration with online services (including the ability to sync apps and settings between devices), and Windows Store, an online store for downloading and purchasing new software. Windows 8 added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format hard drives, near field communications, and cloud computing. Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering service and support for UEFI Secure Boot on supported devices with UEFI firmware, to prevent malware from infecting the boot process.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are Windows main operating system competitors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Android and iOS</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new security features does Windows 8 have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering service and support for UEFI Secure Boot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What USB version is Windows 8 compatible with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3.0</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What services does the Windows Store provide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an online store for downloading and purchasing new software</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be found on the Start screen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Windows 8 was released to a mixed critical reception.

Despite these shortcomings, 60 million Windows 8 licenses have been sold through January 2013, a number which included both upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What about Windows 8 was well received?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the perceived problems with the new Windows 8 user interface?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">being potentially confusing and difficult to learn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Windows 8 licenses were purchased by January 2013?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Windows 8 development started before Windows 7 had shipped in 2009.

Windows division president Steven Sinofsky demonstrated an early build of the port on prototype devices, while Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the company's goal for Windows to be &quot;everywhere on every kind of device without compromise.&quot; Details also began to surface about a new application framework for Windows 8 codenamed &quot;Jupiter&quot;, which would be used to make &quot;immersive&quot; applications using XAML (similarly to Windows Phone and Silverlight) that could be distributed via a new packaging system and a rumored application store.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Windows division president?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steven Sinofsky</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Microsoft start creating Windows 8?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">before Windows 7 had shipped in 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is jupiter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new application framework for Windows 8</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the Windows 8 plans initially announced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Consumer Electronics Show</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Microsofts CEO?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steve Ballmer</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Three milestone releases of Windows 8 leaked to the general public. Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on April 12, 2011. It was the first build where the text of a window was written centered instead of aligned to the left. It was also probably the first appearance of the Metro-style font, and its wallpaper had the text shhh... let's not leak our hard work. However, its detailed build number reveals that the build was created on September 22, 2010. The leaked copy edition was Enterprise edition. The OS still reads as &quot;Windows 7&quot;. Milestone 2, Build 7955, was leaked on April 25, 2011. The traditional Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) was replaced by a new Black screen, although this was later scrapped. This build introduced a new ribbon in Windows Explorer. Build 7959, with minor changes but the first 64-bit version, was leaked on May 1, 2011. The &quot;Windows 7&quot; logo was temporarily replaced with text displaying &quot;Microsoft Confidential&quot;. On June 17, 2011, build 7989 64-bit edition was leaked. It introduced a new boot screen featuring the same fish as the default Windows 7 Beta wallpaper, which was later scrapped, and the circling dots as featured in the final (although the final version comes with smaller circling dots throbber).

Alongside other changes, the build removed the Start button from the taskbar for the first time since its debut on Windows 95; according to Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen, the Start button was removed to reflect their view that on Windows 8, the desktop was an &quot;app&quot; itself, and not the primary interface of the operating system. Windows president Steven Sinofsky said more than 100,000 changes had been made since the developer version went public. The day after its release, Windows 8 Consumer Preview had been downloaded over one million times.

Concerns were raised that secure boot could prevent or hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as Linux. In a post discussing secure boot on the Building Windows 8 blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that &quot;At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC. Microsoft's philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves.&quot; Microsoft's certification guidelines for Windows 8 ultimately revealed that vendors would be required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot in their device's UEFI firmware. It also revealed that ARM devices (Windows RT) would be required to have secure boot permanently enabled, with no way for users to disable it. However, Tom Warren of The Verge noted that other vendors have implemented similar hardware restrictions on their own ARM-based tablet and smartphone products (including those running Microsoft's own Windows Phone platform), but still argued that Microsoft should &quot;keep a consistent approach across ARM and x86, though, not least because of the number of users who'd love to run Android alongside Windows 8 on their future tablets.&quot; No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who condemned Microsoft for requiring devices to have secure boot enabled by default?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">free software supporters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What resolution did Microsoft come to in their certificiation guidelines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vendors would be required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Tony Mangefeste?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Microsoft developer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ideology does Microsoft follow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Several notable video game developers criticized Microsoft for making its Windows Store a closed platform subject to its own regulations, as it conflicted with their view of the PC as an open platform.

Tom Warren of The Verge said that although Windows 8's emphasis on touch computing was significant and risked alienating desktop users, a &quot;tablet PC with Windows 8 makes an iPad feel immediately out of date&quot; due to the capabilities of the operating system's hybrid model and increased focus on cloud services. David Pierce of The Verge described Windows 8 as &quot;the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012&quot; and praised Microsoft's &quot;no compromise&quot; approach and the operating system's emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services. Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a &quot;brilliant innovation for desktop computers&quot; when compared with &quot;folder-littered desktops on every other OS&quot; because it allows users to interact with dynamic information. In contrast, an ExtremeTech article said it was Microsoft &quot;flailing&quot; and a review in PC Magazine condemned the Metro-style user interface. Some of the included apps in Windows 8 were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality, but the Xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi-platform entertainment experience. Other improvements and features (such as File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated Task Manager) were also regarded as positive changes. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that while its user interface changes may overshadow them, Windows 8's improved performance, updated file manager, new storage functionality, expanded security features, and updated Task Manager were still positive improvements for the operating system. Bright also said that Windows 8's duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an &quot;extremely ambitious&quot; aspect of the platform as well, but criticized Microsoft for emulating Apple's model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who equated windos 8 as the first desktop operating system that understand what a computer is supposed to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Pierce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Pierce give the Start Screen such glowing reviews?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because it allows users to interact with dynamic information</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which improvements were most well regarded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated Task Manager</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who else uses a closed distribution platform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apple</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping &quot;wasn't very obvious&quot; due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this &quot;stumbling block&quot;, Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the &quot;Metro&quot; and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was &quot;as stunning as it is surprising&quot;, contributing to an &quot;incredibly personal&quot; experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be &quot;clumsy and impractical&quot; due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it &quot;two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together&quot;), and concluded that &quot;Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes the Windows 8 interface difficult to use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said the Windows 8 interface was clumsy and impractical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adrian Kingsley-Hughes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of feedback has Windows 8 received?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mixed </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, according to research firm NPD, sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to the same time period in 2011.

Despite the reaction of industry experts, Microsoft reported that they had sold 100 million licenses in the first six months. This matched sales of Windows 7 over a similar period.

Microsoft had similarly cut the price of Windows XP licenses to compete against the early waves of Linux-based netbooks. Reports also indicated that Microsoft was planning to offer cheaper Windows 8 licenses to OEMs in exchange for setting Internet Explorer's default search engine to Bing. Some media outlets falsely reported that the SKU associated with this plan, &quot;Windows 8.1 with Bing&quot;, was a variant which would be a free or low-cost version of Windows 8 for consumers using older versions of Windows. On April 2, 2014, Microsoft ultimately announced that it would be removing license fees entirely for devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, and officially confirmed the rumored &quot;Windows 8.1 with Bing&quot; OEM SKU on May 23, 2014.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Microsoft make the existence of Windows 8.1 with Bing OEM SKU official?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 23, 2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Microsoft remove license fees on device screens less than 9 inches?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 2, 2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Windows 8 decrease the price of Windows 8 for devices that cost less than $250?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the benefit of Windows 8.1 with Bing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cheaper Windows 8 licenses to OEMs in exchange for setting Internet Explorer's default search engine to Bing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In May 2014, the Government of China banned the internal purchase of Windows 8-based products under government contracts requiring &quot;energy-efficient&quot; devices.
