Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust (in Schindler's List), the transatlantic slave trade (in Amistad), war (in Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Bridge of Spies) and terrorism (in Munich). His other films include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones film series, and A.I.

His paternal grandparents were immigrants from Ukraine who settled in Cincinnati in the first decade of the 1900s. In 1950, his family moved to Haddon Township, New Jersey when his father took a job with RCA.

One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, Close Encounters was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other Academy Awards nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, Vilmos Zsigmond, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, 1941, a big-budgeted World War II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4 million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What films did Spielberg turn down in the 70s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jaws 2, King Kong and Superman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Oscars did Close Encounters win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Oscars did Close Encounters get nominated for, besides Best Director?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the genre of '1941'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War II farce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did '1941' earn?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over $92.4 million worldwide</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Spielberg then revisited his Close Encounters project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released Close Encounters: The Special Edition in 1980.

It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture).

Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood, and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What theme is common to Spielberg's films?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When in his life did Spielberg 'feel like an alien'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">during childhood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Spielberg give an interview saying he had 'felt like an alien'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why does Spielberg think aliens would visit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">uriosity and sharing of knowledge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Spielberg's parents liked sci-fi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> his father</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A strong consistent theme in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naïve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Hook, A.I. Artificial Intelligence and The BFG. According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like Munich, Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal, Minority Report, and Amistad. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in Jaws are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In Empire of the Sun, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in Catch Me If You Can, Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Spielberg films are examples of a childlike sense of wonder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Hook, A.I.

Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in Hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son &quot;self reliance,&quot; which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Indy's father's career?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">professor of medieval literature</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artifact did Indy's father focus on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Holy Grail</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Spielberg's most common theme?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tension in parent-child relationships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose son disappeared in 'Minority Report'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Anderton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose parents divorced in 'Catch Me If You Can'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Abagnale</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films. For instance, he has cast Richard Dreyfuss in several films: Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Always. Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast Harrison Ford as a headteacher in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (though the scene was ultimately cut). Although Spielberg directed veteran voice actor Frank Welker only once (in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he voiced many of the animals), Welker has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executive produced from Gremlins to its sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch, as well as The Land Before Time, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and television shows such as Tiny Toons, Animaniacs, and SeaQuest DSV. Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal, and Bridge of Spies.

One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, the final scene of Jurassic Park, and the end credits of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (where they ride into the sunset)), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene. Spielberg is a contemporary of filmmakers George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, John Milius, and Brian De Palma, collectively known as the &quot;Movie Brats&quot;. Aside from his principal role as a director, Spielberg has acted as a producer for a considerable number of films, including early hits for Joe Dante and Robert Zemeckis.
