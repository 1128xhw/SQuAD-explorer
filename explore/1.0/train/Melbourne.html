An extensive radial railway network centred on Melbourne and spreading out across the suburbs and into the countryside was established from the late 1850s. Further major public buildings were begun in the 1860s and 1870s such as the Supreme Court, Government House, and the Queen Victoria Market. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases, particularly smallpox, frontier violence and dispossession from their lands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the gold rush over in Melbourne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1860</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Melbourne grow as major port for exporting the agricultural products?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gold mining</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was protected by high tarriffs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> wool</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1863, why was Aboriginal population declining?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diseases, particularly smallpox, frontier violence and dispossession from their lands.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year was the gold rush largely over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1860</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the major agricultural products of Victoria around 1860?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wool</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were some of the reasons the Aboriginal population continued to recline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ntroduced diseases, particularly smallpox, frontier violence and dispossession from their lands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which disease in particular caused the Aboriginal population to continue a decline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">smallpox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Aboriginal population declined by what estimated percentage by 1863?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 80%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Melbourne (/ˈmɛlbərn/, AU i/ˈmɛlbən/) is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria, and the second most populous city in Australia and Oceania.

This often occurs in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times in a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having &quot;four seasons in one day&quot;, a phrase that is part of local popular culture and familiar to many visitors to the city.

These factors have led to population growth and further suburban expansion through the 2000s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what areas has Melbourne dedicated substantial international investment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> industries and property market</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what areas has major inner-city urban renewal occurred?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Southbank, Port Melbourne, Melbourne Docklands and more recently, South Wharf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Melbourne has sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate in any Australian city according to what organization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australian Bureau of Statistics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years did Melbourne sustain the highest population increase and economic growth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Melbourne is experiencing high population growth, generating high demand for housing.

Melbourne has one of the largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, with a high level of car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east. There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne. Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA Victoria and several local councils. Air pollution, by world standards, is classified as being good. Summer and autumn are the worst times of year for atmospheric haze in the urban area.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Melbourne set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city notably opted not to become carbon neutral in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">City of Glen Eira</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year did Melbourne state it wished to be completely carbon neutral?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2020</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does Melbourne have one of the largest or smallest carbon footprints in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> largest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for regulating pollution in Melbourne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">EPA Victoria and several local councils</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2012, the city contained a total of 594 high-rise buildings, with 8 under construction, 71 planned and 39 at proposal stage making the city's skyline the second largest in Australia.

Batman selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River, declaring that &quot;this will be the place for a village&quot;. Batman then returned to Launceston in Tasmania. In early August 1835 a different group of settlers, including John Pascoe Fawkner, left Launceston on the ship Enterprize. Fawkner was forced to disembark at Georgetown, Tasmania, because of outstanding debts. The remainder of the party continued and arrived at the mouth of the Yarra River on 15 August 1835. On 30 August 1835 the party disembarked and established a settlement at the site of the current Melbourne Immigration Museum.

Like many urban environments, the city faces significant environmental issues, many of them relating to the city's large urban footprint and urban sprawl and the demand for infrastructure and services. One such issue is water usage, drought and low rainfall. Drought in Victoria, low rainfalls and high temperatures deplete Melbourne water supplies and climate change may have a long-term impact on the water supplies of Melbourne. In response to low water supplies and low rainfall due to drought, the government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including: water recycling schemes for the city, incentives for household water tanks, greywater systems, water consumption awareness initiatives, and other water saving and reuse initiatives; also, in June 2007, the Bracks Government announced that a $3.1 billion Wonthaggi desalination plant would be built on Victoria's south-east coast, capable of treating 150 billion litres of water per year, as well as a 70 km (43 mi) pipeline from the Goulburn area in Victoria's north to Melbourne and a new water pipeline linking Melbourne and Geelong. Both projects are being conducted under controversial Public-Private Partnerships and a multitude of independent reports have found that neither project is required to supply water to the city and that Sustainable Water Management is the best solution.

A notable film shot and set in Melbourne during Australia's cinematic lull is On the Beach (1959). The 1970s saw the rise of the Australian New Wave and its Ozploitation offshoot, instigated by Melbourne-based productions Stork and Alvin Purple. Picnic at Hanging Rock and Mad Max, both shot in and around Melbourne, achieved worldwide acclaim. 2004 saw the construction of Melbourne's largest film and television studio complex, Docklands Studios Melbourne, which has hosted many domestic productions, as well as international features.
