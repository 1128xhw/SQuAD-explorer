Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization.

While the Alexandrian empire did not survive its creator's death intact, the cultural implications of the spread of Hellenism across much of the Middle East and Asia were to prove long lived as Greek became the lingua franca, a position it retained even in Roman times.

An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with barbarian (non-Greek) peoples, which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi-ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms.

Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably St Paul) were generally Greek-speaking, though none were from Greece. However, Greece itself had a tendency to cling to paganism and was not one of the influential centers of early Christianity: in fact, some ancient Greek religious practices remained in vogue until the end of the 4th century, with some areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remaining pagan until well into the 10th century AD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the religions of the past begin to dissipate ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decline beginning in the 3rd century BC </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What encouraged the change of faith ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with the introduction of new religious movements from the East.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religions form of worship came from the Eastern sects ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The cults of deities like Isis and Mithra were introduced into the Greek world.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group was significant in the expansion of the Christian faith ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language are the Apostle's namely believed to have spoken ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably St Paul) were generally Greek-speaking</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Of the new eastern religions introduced into the Greek world, the most successful was Christianity.

That new notion of nationhood engendered a deep interest in the classical past culminating in the ideas of the Neoplatonist philosopher Gemistus Pletho, who abandoned Christianity. However, it was the combination of Orthodox Christianity with a specifically Greek identity that shaped the Greeks' notion of themselves in the empire's twilight years. The interest in the Classical Greek heritage was complemented by a renewed emphasis on Greek Orthodox identity, which was reinforced in the late Medieval and Ottoman Greeks' links with their fellow Orthodox Christians in the Russian Empire. These were further strengthened following the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, after which and until the second Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29 hundreds of thousands of Pontic Greeks fled or migrated from the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands to southern Russia and the Russian South Caucasus (see also Greeks in Russia, Greeks in Armenia, Greeks in Georgia, and Caucasian Greeks).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the resurface of the Grecian monotony in politics ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade in 1204</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the nation reestablish itself ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> empire was revived in 1261</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the specialty of great Pietho and what is famous for ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philosopher Gemistus Pletho, who abandoned Christianity. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was bolstered by the the final downward spiral of the Empire of Trebizond ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">interest in the Classical Greek heritage was complemented by a renewed emphasis on Greek Orthodox identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which factoring war was on gong in 1828 and shares the of a previous scuttle ? ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> second Russo-Turkish War</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the West, particularly Italy, Central Europe, Germany and Russia. Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the emperor Constantine  lose rule over in 1453 ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the populace do in response to the loss ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the West</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of position did Greeks come to hold in the Ottoman Empire ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made up the majority of soldiers in the Ottoman Empire ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of work were must young boys antiquated with in the Ottoman Empire ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For those that remained under the Ottoman Empire's millet system, religion was the defining characteristic of national groups (milletler), so the exonym &quot;Greeks&quot; (Rumlar from the name Rhomaioi) was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the Orthodox Church, regardless of their language or ethnic origin. The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi, (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (genos) to be Hellenic. There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman millet system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Greek Orthodox protector, the Russian Empire, or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-Christian. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as Greek Muslims - excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the devshirme - were to be found in Crete (Cretan Turks), Greek Macedonia (for example among the Vallahades of western Macedonia), and among Pontic Greeks in the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands. Several Ottoman sultans and princes were also of part Greek origin, with mothers who were either Greek concubines or princesses from Byzantine noble families, one famous example being sultan Selim the Grim, whose mother Gülbahar Hatun was a Pontic Greek.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were the population factions of the Ottoman Empire classified ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religion was the defining characteristic of national groups </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did it mean to be classified as a Greek by the millet command ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the Orthodox Church, regardless of their language or ethnic origin.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What moniker did the Greeks grant themselves for distinction ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the literate segment of Greeks consider to be a part of their ethic lines ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those educated, considered their ethnicity (genos) to be Hellenic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were Christian prized among the Ottomans ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman millet system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The roots of Greek success in the Ottoman Empire can be traced to the Greek tradition of education and commerce.

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the &quot;Greeks&quot; who later came to be known as &quot;Hellenes&quot;. Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means &quot;sacrificers&quot; (compare Gothic saljan, &quot;present, sacrifice&quot;). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to the legend it was founded after the Trojan War by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area is given to be the nesting point of a small group of pagans by a infamous philosopher from Greek ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hellenes&quot; (/ˈhɛliːnz/) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what mystical lineage does this name benefactor ascend from ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is this small group named for ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is the name more ancient than other group names in the area ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many orginal founding patrons are there of the Great Amphictyonic League ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with twelve founders </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, Graecus is presented as the son of Zeus and Pandora II, sister of Hellen the patriarch of Hellenes. Hellen was the son of Deucalion who ruled around Phthia in central Greece. The Parian Chronicle mentions that when Deucalion became king of Phthia, the previously called Graikoi were named Hellenes. Aristotle notes that the Hellenes were related with Grai/Greeks (Meteorologica I.xiv) a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt. However, according to the Greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece. A modern theory derives the name Greek (Latin Graeci) from Graikos, &quot;inhabitant of Graia/Graea,&quot; a town on the coast of Boeotia. Greek colonists from Graia helped to found Cumae (900 BC) in Italy, where they were called Graeces. When the Romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all Greeks (Graeci.) The word γραῖα graia &quot;old woman&quot; comes from the PIE root *ǵerh2-/*ǵreh2-, &quot;to grow old&quot; via Proto-Greek *gera-/grau-iu; the same root later gave γέρας geras (/keras/), &quot;gift of honour&quot; in Mycenean Greek. The Germanic languages borrowed the word Greeks with an initial &quot;k&quot; sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the Latin &quot;g&quot; at the time (Goth. Kreks). The area out of ancient Attica including Boeotia was called Graïke and is connected with the older deluge of Ogyges, the mythological ruler of Boeotia. The region was originally occupied by the Minyans who were autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people.

In the 5th century BC, they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos. There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans. According to one view, the Achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper Europe, who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age (1300 BC) to southern Europe. Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. These theories are rejected by other scholars who, based on linguistic criteria, suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC. Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya. Egyptian documents refer to Ekwesh, one of the groups of sea peoples who attached Egypt during the reign of Merneptah (1213-1203 BCE), who may have been Achaeans.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What interchangeable terms did Homer use in his poems for Greeks ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Achaeans and Danaans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is believed to be the derivative of these names ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pre-Dorian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was redefined in the 5th century about the people of these names?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was this origin of this redefinition ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> spoken mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the age in 1300 BC named ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> early Iron age</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: Δαναοί) and Argives (Argives: Αργείοι) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: &quot;river&quot;. There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: &quot;flow, river&quot;, da:-nu: &quot;any moving liquid, drops&quot;, da: navo &quot;people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt.

Scholars compare its continuity of tradition to Chinese alone. Since its inception, Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture and the national continuity of the Greek world is a lot more certain than its demographic. Yet, Hellenism also embodied an ancestral dimension through aspects of Athenian literature that developed and influenced ideas of descent based on autochthony. During the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire, areas such as Ionia and Constantinople experienced a Hellenic revival in language, philosophy, and literature and on classical models of thought and scholarship. This revival provided a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage. The cultural changes undergone by the Greeks are, despite a surviving common sense of ethnicity, undeniable. At the same time, the Greeks have retained their language and alphabet, certain values and cultural traditions, customs, a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion, (the word barbarian was used by 12th-century historian Anna Komnene to describe non-Greek speakers), a sense of Greek identity and common sense of ethnicity despite the global political and social changes of the past two millennia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the easiest connection between the Greeks of old and those of today ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> most obvious link between modern and ancient Greeks is their language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How log did the age of darkness last for the Greeks ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek Dark Ages (lasting from the 11th to the 8th century BC)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who else has a history as long standing as those of the Greeks ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> continuity of tradition to Chinese alone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did most of the Eastward sector of the Roman expanse choose to have a rebirth of Greek traditions and appreciations ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> During the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What aspects of the Greek culture have remained steadfast throughout the years ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> retained their language and alphabet, certain values and cultural traditions, customs, a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Today, Greeks are the majority ethnic group in the Hellenic Republic, where they constitute 93% of the country's population, and the Republic of Cyprus where they make up 78% of the island's population (excluding Turkish settlers in the occupied part of the country).

After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974, there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving, especially for the Middle East, which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s.

The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught, and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students, the world’s first university as well.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What contribution to the scientific community have the Greeks left the world ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">science and helped lay the foundations of several western scientific traditions, like philosophy, historiography and mathematics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What school practices were kept by the Roman world after the fall of Greece ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been maintained by the Greeks throughout their extended history ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia (education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one the most elevated values among the Grecian society ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paideia was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what location did education begin for the first set of people to be eligible to earn and advanced degree in a particular subject ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As of 2007, Greece had the eighth highest percentage of tertiary enrollment in the world (with the percentages for female students being higher than for male) while Greeks of the Diaspora are equally active in the field of education.

Commonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine proper nouns in the nominative case. Exceptionally, some end in -ou, indicating the genitive case of this proper noun for patronymic reasons. Although surnames in mainland Greece are static today, dynamic and changing patronymic usage survives in middle names where the genitive of father's first name is commonly the middle name (this usage having been passed on to the Russians). In Cyprus, by contrast, surnames follow the ancient tradition of being given according to the father’s name.
