It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, included it being the first to introduce Sony's social gaming service, PlayStation Network, and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, being able to remote control the console from the devices. In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released, being lighter and thinner than the original version, which notably featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console. As of March 2016, PlayStation 3 has sold 85 million units worldwide. Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the PlayStation 3 released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What social gaming service was integrated into the PlayStation 3?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PlayStation Network</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the thinner version of the PS3 called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Slim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Super Slim model hit stores?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2012</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many PlayStation 3 units had been purchased as of early 2016?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">85 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sony officially unveiled PlayStation 3 (then marketed as PLAYSTATION 3) to the public on May 16, 2005, at E3 2005, along with a 'boomerang' shaped prototype design of the Sixaxis controller.

Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future. Firmware update 3.30 officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in 3D, requiring a compatible display for use. System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films. While the game itself must be programmed to take advantage of the 3D technology, titles may be patched to add in the functionality retroactively.

Fixstars Solutions sells a version of Yellow Dog Linux for PlayStation 3 (originally sold by Terra Soft Solutions). RapidMind produced a stream programming package for PS3, but were acquired by Intel in 2009. Also, on January 3, 2007, Dr. Frank Mueller, Associate Professor of Computer science at NCSU, clustered 8 PS3s. Mueller commented that the 256 MB of system RAM is a limitation for this particular application and is considering attempting to retrofit more RAM.

The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation's most successful console in terms of units sold. Furthermore, PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start, and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series (regarding cross-platform games, Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006, although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed), and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360.

If we are being realistic, we might have to stop supporting Sony.&quot; Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement, notably from developer Bioware who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move, and referred to the statement as &quot;silly.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group does Bobby Kotick think is being discouraged from working on the PS3?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">developers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does &quot;ROIC&quot; stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">return on invested capital</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company is Kotick the CEO of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Activision Blizzard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What newspaper reported Kotick's concerns and his threat to stop supporting the PlayStation platform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What game development company completely disagreed with Kotick's statements in The Times interview?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bioware</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite the initial negative press, several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware.

PS3 Slim also received praise from PC World giving it a 90 out of 100 praising its new repackaging and the new value it brings at a lower price as well as praising its quietness and the reduction in its power consumption.

Criticism was placed on the new disc loader, stating: &quot;The cover can be moved by hand if you wish, there's also an eject button to do the work for you, but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar (XMB) interface. In addition, you have to close the cover by hand, which can be a bit fiddly if it's upright, and the PS3 won't start reading a disc unless you do [close the cover].&quot; They also said there is no real drop in retail price.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What quality of the PS3 Super Slim was the website Spong excited about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quietness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to quieter fans and drive, what change from the other models did Spong praise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">smaller, lighter size</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What piece of the PS3 Super Slim's hardware did Spong say was too &quot;fiddly&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disc loader</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Spong said you have to do to the disc loader before the console will start reading the disc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">close the cover</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars (&quot;Excellent&quot;), saying &quot;The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [...]&quot;, whilst also criticising the &quot;cheap&quot; design and disc-loader, stating: &quot;Sometimes [the cover] doesn't catch and you feel like you're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines. In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.&quot; The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is &quot;the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed.&quot; They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what's to come. &quot;It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What website rated the Super Slim four out of five stars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CNET</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What adjective did CNET use to describe the PS3 Super Slim's design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;cheap&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What component of the Super Slim did CNET call &quot;the easiest yet&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hard drive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What hardware component did CNET have the biggest problem with, even comparing it to an old credit card reader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disc-loader</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was the lowest-priced Super Slim more or less expensive than any of the PS3 Slim models?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more expensive</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Technology magazine T3 gave the Super Slim model a positive review, stating the console is almost &quot;nostalgic&quot; in the design similarities to the original &quot;fat&quot; model, &quot;While we don’t know whether it will play PS3 games or Blu-ray discs any differently yet, the look and feel of the new PS3 Slim is an obvious homage to the original PS3, minus the considerable excess weight.
