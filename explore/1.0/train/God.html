The concept of God as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively (as opposed to receptively) creating the universe has caused some religions to give &quot;Him&quot; the metaphorical name of &quot;Father&quot;. Because God is conceived as not being a corporeal being, God cannot(some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image; some religious groups use a man (sometimes old and bearded) to symbolize God because of His deed of creating man's mind in the image of His own.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does it mean to say that God is omnipotent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unlimited power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the feeling of God being everywhere?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">omnipresence </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the extent of God's knowledge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infinite knowledge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is infinite knowledge classified as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">omniscience </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the benevolence of God called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">omnibenevolence </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does God have a gender?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">without any human biological gender</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of human is God portrayed as in some religions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a man (sometimes old and bearded)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a God in monotheism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Supreme Being and principal object of faith</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe.

In atheism, God is not believed to exist, while God is deemed unknown or unknowable within the context of agnosticism.

In the ancient Egyptian era of Atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called Aten, premised on being the one &quot;true&quot; Supreme Being and Creator of the Universe. In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism, &quot;He Who Is&quot;, &quot;I Am that I Am&quot;, and the tetragrammaton YHWH are used as names of God, while Yahweh and Jehovah are sometimes used in Christianity as vocalizations of YHWH. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, God, consubstantial in three persons, is called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In Judaism, it is common to refer to God by the titular names Elohim or Adonai, the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the Egyptian Aten. In Islam, the name Allah, &quot;Al-El&quot;, or &quot;Al-Elah&quot; (&quot;the God&quot;) is used, while Muslims also have a multitude of titular names for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered a monistic deity. Other religions have names for God, for instance, Baha in the Bahá'í Faith, Waheguru in Sikhism, and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are vocalizations of the name of God, YHWH?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yahweh and Jehovah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Holy Trinity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the time of Atenism, what was God called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aten</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Islamic name for God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Allah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do members of the Bahá'í Faith call God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baha </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first monotheistic religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atenism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the God of the Hebrew Bible called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">YHWH </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Christian God called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yahweh and Jehovah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the 2 titular names of God in the Jewish religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elohim or Adonai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do scholars believe the name Adonai came from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aten</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The earliest written form of the Germanic word God (always, in this usage, capitalized) comes from the 6th-century Christian Codex Argenteus.

The Abrahamic conceptions of God include the monotheistic definition of God in Judaism, the trinitarian view of Christians, and the Islamic concept of God. The dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine: views of God in Hinduism vary by region, sect, and caste, ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic to atheistic. Divinity was recognized by the historical Buddha, particularly Śakra and Brahma. However, other sentient beings, including gods, can at best only play a supportive role in one's personal path to salvation.

The view that all theists actually worship the same god, whether they know it or not, is especially emphasized in Hinduism and Sikhism. In Christianity, the doctrine of the Trinity describes God as one God in three persons. The Trinity comprises God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. Islam's most fundamental concept is tawhid (meaning &quot;oneness&quot; or &quot;uniqueness&quot;). God is described in the Quran as: &quot;Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.&quot; Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism. In Islam, God is beyond all comprehension or equal and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules, and are not expected to visualize God.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Muslims believe that Trinitism too closely resembles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polytheism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which belief is expected to never try and visualize God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iconodules</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most basic belief of the Muslim religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tawhid </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religious text helps reinforce to Muslims that Christianity is more like polytheism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quran </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the meaning behind the Muslim concept of tawhid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;oneness&quot; or &quot;uniqueness&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion believes that all theist worship the same god?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hinduism and Sikhism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the trinity in Christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one God in three persons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do monotheists believe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one god</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Muslims think of Christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comparing it to polytheism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Theism generally holds that God exists realistically, objectively, and independently of human thought; that God created and sustains everything; that God is omnipotent and eternal; and that God is personal and interacting with the universe through, for example, religious experience and the prayers of humans. Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, asserts that, due to the nature of time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future.

Pandeism and Panendeism, respectively, combine Deism with the Pantheistic or Panentheistic beliefs.

Some non-theists avoid the concept of God, whilst accepting that it is significant to many; other non-theists understand God as a symbol of human values and aspirations. The nineteenth-century English atheist Charles Bradlaugh declared that he refused to say &quot;There is no God&quot;, because &quot;the word 'God' is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct affirmation&quot;; he said more specifically that he disbelieved in the Christian god. Stephen Jay Gould proposed an approach dividing the world of philosophy into what he called &quot;non-overlapping magisteria&quot; (NOMA). In this view, questions of the supernatural, such as those relating to the existence and nature of God, are non-empirical and are the proper domain of theology. The methods of science should then be used to answer any empirical question about the natural world, and theology should be used to answer questions about ultimate meaning and moral value. In this view, the perceived lack of any empirical footprint from the magisterium of the supernatural onto natural events makes science the sole player in the natural world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some non-theists view God as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a symbol of human values and aspirations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Although a proclaimed atheist, who was it that said &quot;the word 'God' is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct affirmation&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Bradlaugh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is NOMA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-overlapping magisteria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In NOMA, what should be used to answer questions about the physical world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">science </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What should be used to answer ultimate questions on morality and meaning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">theology </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name the nineteenth century English atheist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Bradlaugh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Stephen Jay Gould call philosophy that deals in the supernatural?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-overlapping magisteria&quot; (NOMA)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What category does NOMA fall under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">theology </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another view, advanced by Richard Dawkins, is that the existence of God is an empirical question, on the grounds that &quot;a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without, and it would be a scientific difference.&quot; Carl Sagan argued that the doctrine of a Creator of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could disprove the existence of a Creator would be the discovery that the universe is infinitely old.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Sagan argue was the only was to prove the existence of God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the discovery that the universe is infinitely old</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Richard Dawkins belief about the existence of God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without, and it would be a scientific difference.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of difference does Dawkins believe would come from the existence of God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a scientific difference</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who argued that the existence of God is an empirical question?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard Dawkins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who stated that God was difficult both to prove or disprove?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carl Sagan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How could science discover if there was not a creator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the universe is infinitely old.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God.

Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is sex by God handled in a monotheistic religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do polytheistic religions view sex by God or gods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is God's role in the creation of the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">begetter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what ways can the gender of God be viewed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literal or an allegorical aspect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do polytheistic religions assign to their gods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gender </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What role does got serve in a sexual intercourse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the active (as opposed to the receptive) role </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which type of religion does God have no sexual partner?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monotheistic </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prayer plays a significant role among many believers. Muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship God. He is viewed as a personal God and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God. Prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness. God is often believed to be forgiving. For example, a hadith states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance. Christian theologian Alister McGrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a &quot;personal god&quot; is integral to the Christian outlook, but that one has to understand it is an analogy. &quot;To say that God is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others. This does not imply that God is human, or located at a specific point in the universe.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a muslims life purpose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to worship God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of God is the Muslim God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a personal God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What aspect does Alister McGrath argue is important in Christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a &quot;personal god&quot; </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does prayer usually include in Islam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">forgiveness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of God is the Muslim God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">forgiving</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Adherents of different religions generally disagree as to how to best worship God and what is God's plan for mankind, if there is one. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believe they are the one and only chosen few?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exclusivists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believe that they are the only people that know the truth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exclusivists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one called that believes he has the one religion, but that the others aren't necessarily wrong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pluralism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when someone belives that their own religion is an advancement of older religions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">supersessionism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a religion that believes that all religions are correct?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">universalism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many medieval philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God, while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience may seem to imply that God knows how free agents will choose to act. If God does know this, their ostensible free will might be illusory, or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does not know it, God may not be omniscient.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does it mean if God can't predict the future?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God may not be omniscient.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who posited the existence of God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medieval philosophers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophical debates arose in the middle ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God's omniscience</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The last centuries of philosophy have seen vigorous questions regarding the arguments for God's existence raised by such philosophers as Immanuel Kant, David Hume and Antony Flew, although Kant held that the argument from morality was valid. The theist response has been either to contend, as does Alvin Plantinga, that faith is &quot;properly basic&quot;, or to take, as does Richard Swinburne, the evidentialist position. Some theists agree that none of the arguments for God's existence are compelling, but argue that faith is not a product of reason, but requires risk. There would be no risk, they say, if the arguments for God's existence were as solid as the laws of logic, a position summed up by Pascal as &quot;the heart has reasons of which reason does not know.&quot; A recent theory using concepts from physics and neurophysiology proposes that God can be conceptualized within the theory of integrative level.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Alvin Plantinga describe faith?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;properly basic&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who stated &quot;the heart has reasons of which reason does not know&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pascal </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which philosopher takes the evidentialist position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard Swinburne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name three philosophers of the last 100 years arguing for the existence of God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Immanuel Kant, David Hume and Antony Flew</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
