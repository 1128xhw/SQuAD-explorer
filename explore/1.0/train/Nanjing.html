It is the capital city of Jiangsu province of People's Republic of China and the second largest city in East China, with a total population of 8,216,100, and legally the capital of Republic of China which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city whose name means &quot;Southern Capital&quot; has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (江寧), whose former character Jiang (江, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (寧, simplified form 宁, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (京) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later. Nanjing is particularly known as Jinling (金陵, literally meaning Gold Mountain) and the old name has been used since the Warring States Period in Zhou Dynasty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">k</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">k</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">j</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">h</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">n</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">n</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">b</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">b</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">v</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">v</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the legal capital of the Republic of China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nanjing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What region is Nanjing in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lower Yangtze River region</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the city given the name Nanjing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ming dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Nanjing become the Chinese national capital?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jin dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Nanjing mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Southern Capital&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Located in Yangtze River Delta area and the center of East China, Nanjing is home to one of the world's largest inland ports.

Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu, one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period (211-280); the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317-589; the Southern Tang, one of the Ten Kingdoms (937-76); the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368-1421); and the Republic of China (1927–37, 1945–49) prior to its flight to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1851–64) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940–45) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and suffered appalling atrocities in both conflicts, including the Nanjing Massacre. It has been serving as the capital city of Jiangsu province after the China was established, and is still the nominal capital of Republic of China that accommodates many of its important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain.

In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (冶城) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (越城) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (金陵邑) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (秣陵) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long ago did &quot;Nanjing Man&quot; live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 500 thousand years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What vessel was found 5000 years ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zun, a kind of wine vessel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the the fort of Yuecheng built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">473 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long had Nanjing been the capital city of Yangzhou?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 400 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Wu state created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the late period of Shang dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nanjing first became a state capital in 229 AD, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (建業), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in 211 AD.

Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the &quot;Three Furnacelike Cities&quot; along the Yangtze River (长江流域三大火炉) for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally &quot;plum rain&quot;) occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.46 °C (59.8 °F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.4 °C (36.3 °F) in January to 27.8 °C (82.0 °F) in July.

The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at &quot;severely polluted&quot; for five straight days and &quot;heavily polluted&quot; for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013.

Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December.
