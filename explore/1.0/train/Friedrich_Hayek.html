He was a medical doctor employed by the municipal ministry of health, with passion in botany, in which he wrote a number of monographs. August von Hayek was also a part-time botany lecturer at the University of Vienna. Friedrich's mother was born in 1875 to a wealthy, conservative, land-owning family. As her mother died several years prior to Friedrich's birth, Felicitas gained a significant inheritance which provided as much as half of her and August's income during the early years of their marriage. Hayek was the oldest of three brothers, Heinrich (1900–69) and Erich (1904–86), who were one-and-a-half and five years younger than him.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Hayek's father?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August von Hayek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was August von Hayek's occupation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medical doctor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was August von Hayek particularly passionate about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> botany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From whom did Felicitas inherit her wealth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many children did August von Hayek and his wife have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>His father's career as a university professor influenced Friedrich's goals later in life.

Von Juraschek was a statistician and was later employed by the Austrian government. Friedrich's paternal grandfather, Gustav Edler von Hayek, taught natural sciences at the Imperial Realobergymnasium (secondary school) in Vienna.

Although Hayek met Wittgenstein on only a few occasions, Hayek said that Wittgenstein's philosophy and methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and thought. In his later years, Hayek recalled a discussion of philosophy with Wittgenstein, when both were officers during World War I.

In school Hayek was much taken by one instructor's lectures on Aristotle's ethics. In his unpublished autobiographical notes, Hayek recalled a division between him and his younger brothers who were only few years younger than him, but he believed that they were somehow of a different generation.

Hayek's time in Monakow's lab, and his deep interest in the work of Ernst Mach, inspired Hayek's first intellectual project, eventually published as The Sensory Order (1952).

When it was published in the United States by the University of Chicago in September of that year, it achieved greater popularity than in Britain. At the arrangement of editor Max Eastman, the American magazine Reader's Digest also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling The Road to Serfdom to reach a far wider audience than academics.

Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for &quot;industrial fluctuations&quot; based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the &quot;Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle&quot;. Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that &quot;the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Mises' 1912 book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Theory of Money and Credit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hayek focused most of his economic works on the business cycle, money and what else?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capital</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What work did Hayek produce as a result of studying Mises' book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the English name for the book Hayek published in 1929?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Hayek, what was the cause of the banks' wrongful allocation of funds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">artificially low interest rates</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1929, Lionel Robbins assumed the helm of the London School of Economics (LSE).

On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature. Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, we have a prima facie obligation to not disrupt such systems.

Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Popper and, in 1982, said that &quot;ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology&quot;.
