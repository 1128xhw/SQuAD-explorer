Pictures (covering films released before 1950) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (covering films released before May 1986). However, TCM now has licensing deals with other Hollywood film studios as well as its Time Warner sister company, Warner Bros. (which now controls the Turner Entertainment library and its own later films), and occasionally shows more recent films. Turner Classic Movies is a dedicated film channel and is available in United States, United Kingdom, France (TCM Cinéma), Spain (TCM España), Nordic countries, Middle East and Africa.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Warner Bros. pictures before what year are part of the Turner Entertainment library?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Up until what month and year of release are films from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer part of the Turner Entertainment library?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 1986</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company owns TCM and Warner Bros.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Time Warner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Turner Classic Movies called in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">TCM Cinéma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Spanish version of Turner Classic Movies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">TCM España</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1986, eight years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, Ted Turner acquired the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio for $1.5 billion.

As part of the deal, Turner Entertainment retained ownership of MGM's library of films released up to May 9, 1986. Turner Broadcasting System was split into two companies; Turner Broadcasting System and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and reincorporated as MGM/UA Communications Co.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did Ted Turner pay for Metro-Goldwyn Mayer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$1.5 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Ted Turner buy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1986</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Ted Turner sell Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Kirk Kerkorian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Ted Turner buy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kirk Kerkorian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Up to what date of release did Turner retain ownership of the MGM film library?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 9, 1986</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The film library of Turner Entertainment would serve as the base form of programming for TCM upon the network's launch.

AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films by 2002 and abandoned its commercial-free format, leaving TCM as the only movie-oriented cable channel to devote its programming entirely to classic films without commercial interruption.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many subscribers had access to TCM upon it launch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When TCM premiered, what was AMC called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American Movie Classics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sorts of films did American Movie Classics primarily show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">released prior to 1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year was AMC showing commercials?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2002 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner, which besides placing Turner Classic Movies and Warner Bros.

In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects – from series such as The Passing Parade, Crime Does Not Pay, Pete Smith Specialties, and Robert Benchley – under the banner name TCM Extras (formerly One Reel Wonders). In 2007, some of the short films featured on TCM were made available for streaming on TCM's website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were TCM Extras previously known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">One Reel Wonders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did short films from TCM begin to stream on TCM's website?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with The Passing Parade, Crime Does Not Pay and Pete Smith Specialties, what short subjects feature on TCM?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Benchley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with :45, :30 and :15 past the hour, at what time do TCM features begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">top of the hour</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>TCM's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or post-produced in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings system and the concurrent disestablishment of the Motion Picture Production Code. Because of this, TCM is formatted similarly to a premium channel with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring nudity, sexual content, violence and/or strong profanity; the network also features rating bumpers prior to the start of a program (most programs on TCM, especially films, are rated for content using the TV Parental Guidelines, in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Motion Picture Association of America introduce its rating system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1968 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Motion Picture Production Code cease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1968 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rating system is often used by TCM?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">TV Parental Guidelines</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The network's programming season runs from February until the following March of each year when a retrospective of Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called 31 Days of Oscar.
