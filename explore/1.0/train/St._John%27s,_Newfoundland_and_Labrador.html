St. John's was incorporated as a city in 1888, yet is considered by some to be the oldest English-founded city in North America. It is located on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland. With a population of 214,285 as of July 1, 2015, the St. John's Metropolitan Area is the second largest Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Atlantic Canada after Halifax and the 20th largest metropolitan area in Canada. It is one of the world's top ten oceanside destinations, according to National Geographic Magazine. Its name has been attributed to the feast day of John the Baptist, when John Cabot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497, and also to a Basque fishing town with the same name.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country is St. John's located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the island that St. John's is located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Newfoundland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city is ranked 20th in largest metropolitan area for Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. John's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where on the Avalon Peninsula is St. John's located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eastern tip</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did St. John's have a population of 214,285?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2015</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>St. John's is one of the oldest settlements in North America, with year-round settlement beginning sometime after 1630 and seasonal habitation long before that. It is not, however, the oldest surviving English settlement in North America or Canada, having been preceded by the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids, founded in 1610, and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace, founded in 1618. In fact, although English fishermen had begun setting up seasonal camps in Newfoundland in the 16th Century, they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast, hence the town of St. John's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s at the earliest. Other permanent English settlements in the Americas that predate St. John's include: St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and Jamestown, Virginia (1607).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city is considered one of the oldest settlements in North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. John's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around what year did settlement begin to occur in St. John's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1630</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Cuper's Cove colony founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1610</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What year was Bristol's Hope colony founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1618</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who forbade the  english fisherman to setup seasonal camps in Newfoundland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British government</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sebastian Cabot declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that the St. John's earned its name when he and his father, the Venetian explorer John Cabot became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the exact locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the Basque Country, it is a common belief that the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is also called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was John Cabot's sons first name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sebastian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the occupation of John Cabot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">explorer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the French, Spanish and Portuguese start to travel to fish yearly in 1540?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Avalon Peninsula</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Bay of Pasaia located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Basque Country</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what language did Sebastian Cabot write his map from 1545?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The earliest record of the location appears as São João on a Portuguese map by Pedro Reinel in 1519.

St. Jehan is shown on Nicholas Desliens' world map of 1541 and San Joham is found in João Freire's Atlas of 1546.

Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the Elias Andrews, and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only twenty-three men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications (Fort William) in around 1689, but actual construction didn't begin until after the French admiral Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696). When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697 they found nothing but rubble where the town and fortifications had stood.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who briefly seized St. John's in 1665?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Michiel de Ruyter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the dutch attack St. John for a second time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1673</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many men defended the attack from the Dutch in 1673?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twenty-three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who destroyed Fort William in 1696?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pierre Le Moyne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Dutch warships were fended of by Christopher Martin in 1673?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>St. John's was the starting point for the first non-stop transatlantic aircraft flight, by Alcock and Brown in a modified Vickers Vimy IV bomber, in June 1919, departing from Lester's Field in St. John's and ending in a bog near Clifden, Connemara, Ireland.

However, despite this maritime moderation, average January high temperatures are actually slightly colder in St. John's than it is in Kelowna, British Columbia, which is an inland city that is near the more marine air of the Pacific, demonstrating the cold nature of Eastern Canada. Mean temperatures range from −4.9 °C (23.2 °F) in February to 16.1 °C (61.0 °F) in August, showing somewhat of a seasonal lag in the climate. The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States. The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia. This is partly due to its propensity for tropical storm activity as well as moist, Atlantic air frequently blowing ashore and creating precipitation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the climate in St. John's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which province is Kelowna located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Columbia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Canadian city is the most rainiest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> British Columbia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What body of water is to the east of St. John?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atlantic Ocean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where do tropical storms travel from to St. John's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Of major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days), windiest (24.3 km/h (15.1 mph) average speed), and cloudiest (1,497 hours of sunshine). St. John's experiences milder temperatures during the winter season in comparison to other Canadian cities, and has the mildest winter for any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds. In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can transition to heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend deeply into the spring months (March, April). The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain (called &quot;silver thaws&quot;), the worst of which paralyzed the city over a three-day period in April 1984.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the foggiest Canadian city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. John's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average wind speed in miles per hour for St. John's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15.1 mph</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Canadian city has the mildest winter temperature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Columbia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the driest season on average in St. John's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">summer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another word for freezing rain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silver thaws</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Starting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John's consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood.

The provincial government is the largest employer in the city, followed by Memorial University. With the collapse of the fishing industry in Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1990s, the role of the ocean is now tied to what lies beneath it – oil and gas – as opposed to what swims in or travels across it. The city is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Eastern Canada and is one of 19 World Energy Cities. ExxonMobil Canada is headquartered in St. John's and companies such as Chevron, Husky Energy, Suncor Energy and Statoil have major regional operations in the city. Three major offshore oil developments, Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose, are in production off the coast of the city and a fourth development, Hebron, is expected to be producing oil by 2017.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is supported by the federal, provincial and municipal governments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">civil service</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the largest employer in the city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The provincial government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the second largest employer in the city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Memorial University</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did the fishing industry fall in Newfoundland and Labrador?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year is Hebron projected to start producing oil in St. John's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2017</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The economy has been growing quickly in recent years.

St. John's is the only Canadian city served by radio stations whose call letters do not all begin with the letter C. The ITU prefix VO was assigned to the Dominion of Newfoundland before the province joined Canadian Confederation in 1949, and three AM stations kept their existing call letters. However, other commercial radio stations in St. John's which went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes (CF–CK) currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of VOCM-FM, which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the AM station that already bore that callsign. VO also remains in use in amateur radio.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many radio station does the city have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many French-language stations does the city have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the province join the Canadian Confederation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
