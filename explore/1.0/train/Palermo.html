The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what is Palermo known?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> history, culture, architecture and gastronomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old is the city of Palermo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2,700 years old</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what island is Palermo located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sicily</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). Palermo then became a possession of Carthage, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans. Eventually Sicily would be united with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of 1860.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Palermo founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">734 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name was Palermo originally founded as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Ziz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of people founded Palermo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Phoenicians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Greeks name Palermo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Panormus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which years was Palermo ruled by the Arabs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">831 to 1072</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Palermo is Sicily's cultural, economic and touristic capital. It is a city rich in history, culture, art, music and food. Numerous tourists are attracted to the city for its good Mediterranean weather, its renowned gastronomy and restaurants, its Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque churches, palaces and buildings, and its nightlife and music. Palermo is the main Sicilian industrial and commercial center: the main industrial sectors include tourism, services, commerce and agriculture. Palermo currently has an international airport, and a significant underground economy.[citation needed] In fact, for cultural, artistic and economic reasons, Palermo was one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean and is now among the top tourist destinations in both Italy and Europe.

Some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves. Historically, it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of Sicily from the city because of the mounts. The tallest peak of the range is La Pizzuta, about 1,333 m (4,373 ft.) high. However, historically, the most important mount is Monte Pellegrino, which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain. The mount lies right in front of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, as &quot;The most beautiful promontory in the world&quot;, in his essay &quot;Italian Journey&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What geographic form is Palermo surrounded by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What geographic form is Palermo surrounded by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which author desribed Monte Pelegrino as &quot;The most beautiful promontory in the world?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which is the tallest mountain in Sicily?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> La Pizzuta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Monte Pellegrino in relation to other peaks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Today both the Papireto river and the Kemonia are covered up by buildings.

However, the remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area, making any excavation efforts costly and logistically difficult. The site chosen by the Phoenicians made it easy to connect the port to the mountains with a straight road that today has become Corso Calatifimi. This road helped the Phoenicians in trading with the populations that lived beyond the mountains that surround the gulf.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Phoenicans name their settlement in 734BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Ziz.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides Ziz, what other two major settlements belonged to the Phoenicians</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Motya and Soluntum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why cant artifacts from the Phoenicians be easily excavated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the current name of the road the Phoenicians used for trading?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Corso Calatifimi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first settlement is defined as Paleapolis (Παλεάπολις), the Ancient Greek world for &quot;old city&quot;, in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called Neapolis (Νεάπολις), &quot;new city&quot;. The neapolis was erected towards the east and along with it, monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats. Some part of this structure can still be seen in the Cassaro district. This district was named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab al-qsr (castle, stronghold). Along the walls there were few doors to access and exit the city, suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently. Moreover, according to some studies, it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too. The colony developed around a central street (decumanus), cut perpendicularly by minor streets. This street today has become the Corso Vittorio Emanuele.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the first settlement named Paleapolis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called Neapolis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the walls of Neapolis meant to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prevent attacks from foreign threats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which district was named for the walls surrounding it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cassaro</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Carthage was Palermo’s major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement Panormos (Πάνορμος) from which the current name is derived, meaning &quot;all port&quot; due to the shape of its coast. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 B.C. the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the name Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which War did Greeks and Phoenicians fight over control of Sicily?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sicilian Wars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Sicilian Wars end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who conquered Panormos and briefly turned it into a Greek colony?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pyrrhus of Epirus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Greeks name Palermo Panormos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">meaning &quot;all port&quot; due to the shape of its coast.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the Roman Empire was falling apart, Palermo fell under the control of several Germanic tribes.

They acquired Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily shortly afterwards. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to the Ostrogoths. The Ostrogothic conquest under Theodoric the Great began in 488; Theodoric supported Roman culture and government unlike the Germanic Goths. The Gothic War took place between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire.

The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli &amp; Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was blamed for the week long rebellion of 1866?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which families help to start cultural, industrial, and economic growth in Palermo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what style were the villas in the new expanded Palermo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Art Nouveau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which theatre was designed by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile ans opened in 1897?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teatro Massimo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The so-called &quot;Sack of Palermo&quot; is one of the major visible faces of the problem.

The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom.

Winters are cool and wet, while summers are hot and dry. Temperatures in autumn and spring are usually mild. Palermo is one of the warmest cities in Europe (mainly due to its warm nights), with an average annual air temperature of 18.5 °C (65.3 °F). It receives approximately 2,530 hours of sunshine per year. Snow is usually a rare occurrence, but it does occur occasionally if there is a cold front, as the Apennines are too distant to protect the island from cold winds blowing from the Balkans, and the mountains surrounding the city facilite the formation of snow accumulation in Palermo, especially at night. Between the 1940s and the 2000s there have been eleven times when considerable snowfall has occurred: In 1949, in 1956, when the minimum temperature went down to 0 °C (32 °F) and the city was blanketed by several centimeters of snow. Snow also occurred in 1999, 2009 and 2015. The average annual temperature of the sea is above 19 °C (66 °F); from 14 °C (57 °F) in February to 26 °C (79 °F) in August. In the period from May to November, the average sea temperature exceeds 18 °C (64 °F) and in the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 21 °C (70 °F).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Palermo's climate classification?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa).</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do Palermo's temperatures compare to the rest of Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one of the warmest cities in Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many did snow fall in Palermo between 1940and the 2000s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> eleven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much sun does Palermo see each year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2,530 hours</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Palermo has at least 2 circuits of City Walls - many pieces of which still survive.

At this north-east corner there was a defence, Castello a Mare, to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at S Maria della Catena (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porta Nuova.
