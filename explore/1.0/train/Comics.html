Comics frequently takes the form of juxtaposed sequences of panels of images. Often textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. Size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing. Cartooning and similar forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images. Common forms of comics include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books. Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comics albums, and tankōbon have become increasingly common, and online webcomics have proliferated in the 21st century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which form of comics entails the use of photographic images?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fumetti</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to onomatopoeia and captions, what can be used to show the dialogue in comics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">speech balloons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of comic has taken off in the 21st century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">online webcomics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The various sizes as well as how panels are arranged help with what aspect of comics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">narrative pacing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. Comics has had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Rodolphe Töpffer create cartoons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1830s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which superhero appeared in comics in 1938?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Superman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Japanese cartooning known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">manga</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The English term comics is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium and a plural when referring to particular instances, such as individual strips or comic books. Though the term derives from the humorous (or comic) work that predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, it has become standard also for non-humorous works. It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as manga for Japanese comics, or bandes dessinées for French-language comics. There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters. The increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made definition difficult.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">French comics are also known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bandes dessinées</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is the term comics considered singular rather than plural?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when it refers to the medium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The historical aspect of cartooning can be applied to mass reproduction or what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">recurring characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some experts believe comics is a combination of what two things?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">images and text</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Japanese comics called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">manga</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The European, American, and Japanese comics traditions have followed different paths. Europeans have seen their tradition as beginning with the Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer from as early as 1827 and Americans have seen the origin of theirs in Richard F. Outcault's 1890s newspaper strip The Yellow Kid, though many Americans have come to recognize Töpffer's precedence. Japan had a long prehistory of satirical cartoons and comics leading up to the World War II era. The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, manga, in the early 19th century. In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu Tezuka produced a prolific body of work. Towards the close of the 20th century, these three traditions converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the comics album in Europe, the tankōbon[a] in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English-speaking countries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is best known for being the first comics creator in Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rodolphe Töpffer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is considered to be the first comic creator in America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard F.

Following a sales peak in the early 1950s, the content of comic books (particularly crime and horror) was subjected to scrutiny from parent groups and government agencies, which culminated in Senate hearings that led to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority self-censoring body. The Code has been blamed for stunting the growth of American comics and maintaining its low status in American society for much of the remainder of the century. Superheroes re-established themselves as the most prominent comic book genre by the early 1960s. Underground comix challenged the Code and readers with adult, countercultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The first historical overview of Japanese comics was Seiki Hosokibara's Nihon Manga-Shi[i] in 1924.

The field of manga studies increased rapidly, with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s. Formal theories of manga have focused on developing a &quot;manga expression theory&quot;,[k] with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page, distinguishing the medium from film or literature, in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element. Comics studies courses have proliferated at Japanese universities, and Japan Society for Studies in Cartoon and Comics (ja)[l] was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship. The publication of Frederik L. Schodt's Manga! Manga!

Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective. Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. Eisner described what he called &quot;sequential art&quot; as &quot;the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea&quot;; Scott McCloud defined comics &quot;juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer&quot;, a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings. R. C. Harvey defined comics as &quot;pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa&quot;. Each definition has had its detractors. Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting &quot;the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content&quot;. Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who put together a history of American comics in 1947?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Coulton Waugh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Waugh's work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Comics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created a book about comics from a philosophical point of view?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Carrier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book did Will Eisner create in 1985?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Comics and Sequential Art</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for &quot;comics&quot; in different languages.

No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed &quot;closure&quot;. In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or &quot;multiframe&quot;, to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of &quot;les littératures dessinées&quot; (or &quot;drawn literatures&quot;). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound &quot;grammars&quot; to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 1840s, Töpffer wrote theories about whose work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his own</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who introduced the term &quot;multiframe&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henri Vanlier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who used a semiotics method to study comics in the 1970s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who used cognitive science to learn how people understand comics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neil Cohn</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many cultures have taken their words for comics from English, including Russian (Russian: Комикс, komiks) and German (comic).

Prime moments in a narrative are broken down into panels via a process called encapsulation. The reader puts the pieces together via the process of closure by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine panels mentally into events. The size, shape, and arrangement of panels each affect the timing and pacing of the narrative. The contents of a panel may be asynchronous, with events depicted in the same image not necessarily occurring at the same time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the individual images with action called in comics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Panels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Narrative is placed into panels using what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">encapsulation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who puts the panels together using closure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The reader</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Timing and pace of comics is made by adjusting size, shape and what of panels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arrangement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When a comic panel has events that are not at the same time the panel is considered to be what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">asynchronous</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Text is frequently incorporated into comics via speech balloons, captions, and sound effects. Speech balloons indicate dialogue (or thought, in the case of thought balloons), with tails pointing at their respective speakers. Captions can give voice to a narrator, convey characters' dialogue or thoughts, or indicate place or time. Speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics, such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics. Sound effects mimic non-vocal sounds textually using onomatopoeia sound-words.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What association with comics is strong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Speech balloons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The presence of a single speech balloon in an image turns it into what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of words are used to do sound effects in comics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">onomatopoeia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cartooning is most frequently used in making comics, traditionally using ink (especially India ink) with dip pens or ink brushes; mixed media and digital technology have become common.
