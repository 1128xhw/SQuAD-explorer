It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.[c] Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50×109 km).

Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was Neptune found? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mathematical prediction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Neptune first observed? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23 September 1846</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered Neptune? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexis Bouvard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Neptune's largest moon? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Triton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What flew by Neptune in 1989? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Voyager 2</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both have compositions that differ from those of the larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn.

For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C).

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who drew Neptune after observing it with a telescope? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Galileo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Neptune mistaken for at first? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a fixed star</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens when Neptune goes retrograde? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date was Neptune drawn first? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28 December 1612</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who recently researched the original observation of Neptune? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Jamieson</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.

In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844.

On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction.

Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Neptune's mantle rich in? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">water, ammonia and methane</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the hot, dense fluid in Neptune referred to as? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">icy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the fluid in Neptune have a high conductivity of? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electrical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How deep does Neptune's water-ammonia ocean go? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7000 km</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rains on Neptune? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diamond crystals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.

The region between 40 and 42 AU is an example.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the region behind Neptune called? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kuiper belt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Kuiper belt consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small icy worlds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Kuiper belt relative to Neptune?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 AU out to about 55 AU from the Sun</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dominates the Kuiper belt? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neptune's gravity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Neptune's gravity do to Kuiper belt? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects, is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them. Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.

Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit. In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System, with estimated temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many moons does Neptune have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Neptune's largest moon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Triton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered Triton? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Lassell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What orbit does Triton have around Neptune? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">retrograde orbit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Triton's orbit suggest about it's relation to Neptune?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that it was captured</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From July to September 1989, Voyager 2 discovered six moons of Neptune.

Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons—Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea—orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004. A new moon and the smallest yet, S/2004 N 1, was found in 2013.

Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO). The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of this Outer Planet. Both the HST and AO telescopes on Earth has made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the Outer Planets for example. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Neptune's angular diameter range?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The advent of what telescope made it easier to study Neptune?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hubble Space Telescope</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first useful observation of Neptune from the ground?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What seasons are Neptune currently entering?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spring and summer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was discovered around Neptune in 2004 and 2005?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five new small satellites</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune.
