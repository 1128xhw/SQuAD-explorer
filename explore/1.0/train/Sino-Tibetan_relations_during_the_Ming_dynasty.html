Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts and the application of Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521–1566), who ceased relations with Tibet.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mainland Chinese scholars</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some scholars note that Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in civil war and conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as Nepal. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus the importance of the horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) and his spiritual superior Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384–1415), the Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school. However, the Yongle Emperor's attempts were unsuccessful.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What important trade did the Ming Dynasty have with Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">horse trade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what years did the Mongol leader Kublai Khan rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1402–1424</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Yongle Emperor try to build a religious alliance with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Deshin Shekpa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Deshin Shekpa was the head of what school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Karma Kagyu school</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Tibetan leaders had a diplomacy with what neighboring state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nepal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century, but did not garrison permanent troops there.

By the late 16th century, the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama, after increasing their presence in the Amdo region. This culminated in Güshi Khan's (1582–1655) conquest of Tibet from 1637–1642 and the establishment of the Ganden Phodrang regime by the 5th Dalai Lama with his help.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Tibetans use against Ming forays?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">armed resistance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the armed protectors for the Gelug Dalai Lama?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Mongols</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which regime did Güshi Khan help establish? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ganden Phodrang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Mongol-Tibetan alliance started?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1578</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tibet was once a strong power contemporaneous with Tang China (618–907).

With Sakya Pandita's submission to Godan in 1247, Tibet was officially incorporated into the Mongol Empire during the regency of Töregene Khatun (1241–1246). Michael C. van Walt van Praag writes that Godan granted Sakya Pandita temporal authority over a still politically fragmented Tibet, stating that &quot;this investiture had little real impact&quot; but it was significant in that it established the unique &quot;Priest-Patron&quot; relationship between the Mongols and the Sakya lamas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Mongol prince?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Godan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sakya Pandita</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the regent of the Mongol Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Töregene Khatun</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what years was Töregene Khatun the regent of the Mongol Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1241–1246</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Starting in 1236, the Mongol prince Kublai, who later ruled as Khagan from 1260–1294, was granted a large appanage in North China by his superior, Ögedei Khan.

Kublai instituted a unique relationship with the Phagpa lama, which recognized Kublai as a superior sovereign in political affairs and the Phagpa lama as the senior instructor to Kublai in religious affairs.

Morris Rossabi, a professor of Asian history at Queens College, City University of New York, writes that &quot;Khubilai wished to be perceived both as the legitimate Khan of Khans of the Mongols and as the Emperor of China. Though he had, by the early 1260s, become closely identified with China, he still, for a time, claimed universal rule&quot;, and yet &quot;despite his successes in China and Korea, Khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the Great Khan&quot;.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art also noted that in spite of the gradual assimilation of Yuan monarchs, the Mongol rulers largely ignored the literati and imposed harsh policies discriminating against southern Chinese.

Kublai also abolished the imperial examinations of China's civil service legacy, which was not reinstated until Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan's reign (1311–1320). Rossabi writes that Kublai recognized that in order to rule China, &quot;he had to employ Chinese advisors and officials, yet he could not rely totally on Chinese advisers because he had to maintain a delicate balancing act between ruling the sedentary civilization of China and preserving the cultural identity and values of the Mongols.&quot; And &quot;in governing China, he was concerned with the interests of his Chinese subjects, but also with exploiting the resources of the empire for his own aggrandizement. His motivations and objectives alternated from one to the other throughout his reign,&quot; according to Rossabi.

Chen Qingying states that Tsongkhapa wrote a letter to decline the Emperor's invitation, and in this reply, Tsongkhapa wrote:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Ming Dynasty granted what titles to lamas of schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Karmapa Kargyu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Ming Dynasty decline titles from after receiving invitations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mongol </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the founder of the Gelug school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Je Tsongkhapa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invited Je Tsongkhapa to come pay tribute?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ming Yongle Emperor </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the letter declining the Emperor's invitation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tsongkhapa</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A. Tom Grunfeld says that Tsongkhapa claimed ill health in his refusal to appear at the Ming court, while Rossabi adds that Tsongkhapa cited the &quot;length and arduousness of the journey&quot; to China as another reason not to make an appearance. This first request by the Ming was made in 1407, but the Ming court sent another embassy in 1413, this one led by the eunuch Hou Xian (候顯; fl. 1403–1427), which was again refused by Tsongkhapa. Rossabi writes that Tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the Ming court, so he sent his disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes to Nanjing in 1414 on his behalf, and upon his arrival in 1415 the Yongle Emperor bestowed upon him the title of &quot;State Teacher&quot;—the same title earlier awarded the Phagmodrupa ruler of Tibet. The Xuande Emperor (r. 1425–1435) even granted this disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes the title of a &quot;King&quot; (王). This title does not appear to have held any practical meaning, or to have given its holder any power, at Tsongkhapa's Ganden Monastery. Wylie notes that this—like the Karma Kargyu—cannot be seen as a reappointment of Mongol Yuan offices, since the Gelug school was created after the fall of the Yuan dynasty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Ming first request Tsongkhapa to come to court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1407</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Ming court send a second request to Tsongkhapa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1413</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Tsongkhapa send in his place to Nanjing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Chosrje Shākya Yeshes sent to Nanjing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1414</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dawa Norbu argues that modern Chinese Communist historians tend to be in favor of the view that the Ming simply reappointed old Yuan dynasty officials in Tibet and perpetuated their rule of Tibet in this manner.

Perdue says that Wang Anshi (1021–1086), realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds, had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea. The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army's supply wagons. The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement. The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state-supervised markets, but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea-producing regions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Yongle order the construction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to facilitate trade with Tibet </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Yongle want to trade with Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tea, horses, and salt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">where did the trade route pass through?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through Sichuan and crossed Shangri-La County in Yunnan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory &quot;corvée&quot; tax, and therefore Tibetans were &quot;undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy&quot;. Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power. Laird writes that Tibetans eagerly sought Ming court invitations since the gifts the Tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter. As for the Yongle Emperor's gifts to his Tibetan and Nepalese vassals such as silver wares, Buddha relics, utensils for Buddhist temples and religious ceremonies, and gowns and robes for monks, Tsai writes &quot;in his effort to draw neighboring states to the Ming orbit so that he could bask in glory, the Yongle Emperor was quite willing to pay a small price&quot;. The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC lists the Tibetan tribute items as oxen, horses, camels, sheep, fur products, medical herbs, Tibetan incenses, thangkas (painted scrolls), and handicrafts; while the Ming awarded Tibetan tribute-bearers an equal value of gold, silver, satin and brocade, bolts of cloth, grains, and tea leaves. Silk workshops during the Ming also catered specifically to the Tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring Tibetan Buddhist iconography.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why does Van Praag believe the Ming court set up a diplomatic delegation with Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to secure urgently needed horses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What shops were catered to the Tibetan market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Silk workshops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What visual images and symbols were on furnishings from the silk workshops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tibetan Buddhist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who were the Tibetan areas were ruled by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Wang and Nyima believed horses were collected from Tibet as what kind of tax?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a mandatory &quot;corvée&quot; tax</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the Ming dynasty traded horses with Tibet, it upheld a policy of outlawing border markets in the north, which Laird sees as an effort to punish the Mongols for their raids and to &quot;drive them from the frontiers of China.&quot; However, after Altan Khan (1507–1582)—leader of the Tümed Mongols who overthrew the Oirat Mongol confederation's hegemony over the steppes—made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he persuaded the Ming to reopen their border markets in 1573. This provided the Chinese with a new supply of horses that the Mongols had in excess; it was also a relief to the Ming, since they were unable to stop the Mongols from periodic raiding. Laird says that despite the fact that later Mongols believed Altan forced the Ming to view him as an equal, Chinese historians argue that he was simply a loyal Chinese citizen. By 1578, Altan Khan formed a formidable Mongol-Tibetan alliance with the Gelug that the Ming viewed from afar without intervention.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Ming trade horses with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tibet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of the Tümed Mongols?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Altan Khan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Altan Khan overthrow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Oirat Mongol confederation's hegemony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Altan Khan make peace with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ming dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who convinced the Ming to reopen their border markets in 1573?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Altan Khan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Patricia Ebrey writes that Tibet, like Joseon Korea and other neighboring states to the Ming, settled for its tributary status while there were no troops or governors of Ming China stationed in its territory.

However, there were instances in the 14th century when the Hongwu Emperor did use military force to quell unrest in Tibet. John D. Langlois writes that there was unrest in Tibet and western Sichuan, which the Marquis Mu Ying (沐英) was commissioned to quell in November 1378 after he established a Taozhou garrison in Gansu. Langlois notes that by October 1379, Mu Ying had allegedly captured 30,000 Tibetan prisoners and 200,000 domesticated animals. Yet invasion went both ways; the Ming general Qu Neng, under the command of Lan Yu, was ordered to repel a Tibetan assault into Sichuan in 1390.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Hongwu Emperor use military force in Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 14th century </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Marquis Mu Ying commissioned to quell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 1378</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Tibetan prisoners did Mu Ying capture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many animals did Mu Ying capture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200,000 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was ordered to force a Tibetan assault into Sichuan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ming general Qu Neng</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Discussions of strategy in the mid Ming dynasty focused primarily on recovery of the Ordos region, which the Mongols used as a rallying base to stage raids into Ming China.

Sperling finds no textual evidence in either Chinese or Tibetan sources to support this thesis of Petech and Hisashi. Norbu asserts that their thesis is largely based on the list of Ming titles conferred on Tibetan lamas rather than &quot;comparative analysis of developments in China and Tibet.&quot; Rossabi states that this theory &quot;attributes too much influence to the Chinese,&quot; pointing out that Tibet was already politically divided when the Ming dynasty began. Rossabi also discounts the &quot;divide-and-rule&quot; theory on the grounds of the Yongle Emperor's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth Karmapa—one which he hoped would parallel Kublai Khan's earlier relationship with the Sakya Phagpa lama.

These two religious leaders were preoccupied with an overriding concern for dealing with the powerful secular Rinpungpa princes, who were patrons and protectors of the Karma Kargyu lamas. The Rinpungpa leaders were relatives of the Phagmodrupa, yet their authority shifted over time from simple governors to rulers in their own right over large areas of Ü-Tsang. The prince of Rinbung occupied Lhasa in 1498 and excluded the Gelug from attending New Years ceremonies and prayers, the most important event in the Gelug. While the task of New Years prayers in Lhasa was granted to the Karmapa and others, Gendün Gyatso traveled in exile looking for allies. However, it was not until 1518 that the secular Phagmodru ruler captured Lhasa from the Rinbung, and thereafter the Gelug was given rights to conduct the New Years prayer. When the Drikung Kagyu abbot of Drigung Monastery threatened Lhasa in 1537, Gendün Gyatso was forced to abandon the Drepung Monastery, although he eventually returned.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the Rinpungpa leaders related to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Phagmodrupa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the the prince of Rinbung occupy Lhasa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1498</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the most important event to the Gelug?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Years ceremonies and prayers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Gelug was given the right to conduct the New Years prayer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1518</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Zhengde Emperor (r. 1505–1521), who enjoyed the company of lamas at court despite protests from the censorate, had heard tales of a &quot;living Buddha&quot; which he desired to host at the Ming capital; this was none other than the Rinpung-supported Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama then occupying Lhasa. Zhengde's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court, arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox. Despite protests by the Grand Secretary Liang Chu, in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the Palace Chancellery on a mission to invite this Karmapa to Beijing. Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze, consuming 2,835 g (100 oz) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan. After procurring necessary gifts for the mission, he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops. When the request was delivered, the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him. The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun's camp, seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun's entire escort. After this fiasco, Liu fled for his life, but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Zhengde Emperor rule? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1505–1521</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's company did the Zhengde Emperor enjoy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the company of lamas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the 8th Karmapa Lama?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mikyö Dorje</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Elliot Sperling, a specialist of Indian studies and the director of the Tibetan Studies program at Indiana University’s Department of Central Eurasia Studies, writes that &quot;the idea that Tibet became part of China in the 13th century is a very recent construction.&quot; He writes that Chinese writers of the early 20th century were of the view that Tibet was not annexed by China until the Manchu Qing dynasty invasion during the 18th century.

After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso (1543–1588)—to meet him in Amdo (modern Qinghai) in 1578, where he accidentally bestowed him and his two predecessors with the title of Dalai Lama—&quot;Ocean Teacher&quot;. The full title was &quot;Dalai Lama Vajradhara&quot;, &quot;Vajradhara&quot; meaning &quot;Holder of the Thunderbolt&quot; in Sanskrit. Victoria Huckenpahler notes that Vajradhara is considered by Buddhists to be the primordial Buddha of limitless and all-pervasive beneficial qualities, a being that &quot;represents the ultimate aspect of enlightenment.&quot; Goldstein writes that Sönam Gyatso also enhanced Altan Khan's standing by granting him the title &quot;king of religion, majestic purity&quot;. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama officially recognized Altan Khan as the &quot;Protector of the Faith&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What region did the Tumed Mongols move into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Kokonor region</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which frontier did the Tumed Mongols raid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ming Chinese frontier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The presence of the Altan Khan in the west reduced whos influence? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Altan Khan make peace with the Ming dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1571</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Altan Khan invite to meet him in Amdo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Laird writes that Altan Khan abolished the native Mongol practices of shamanism and blood sacrifice, while the Mongol princes and subjects were coerced by Altan to convert to Gelug Buddhism—or face execution if they persisted in their shamanistic ways.

Sometime in August or September of that year, Sonam Gyatso's representative stationed with Altan Khan received a return letter and gift from the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620), who also conferred upon Sonam Gyatso a title; this was the first official contact between a Dalai Lama and a government of China. However, Laird states that when Wanli invited him to Beijing, the Dalai Lama declined the offer due to a prior commitment, even though he was only 400 km (250 mi) from Beijing. Laird adds that &quot;the power of the Ming emperor did not reach very far at the time.&quot; Although not recorded in any official Chinese records, Sonam Gyatso's biography states that Wanli again conferred titles on Sonam Gyatso in 1588, and invited him to Beijing for a second time, but Sonam Gyatso was unable to visit China as he died the same year in Mongolia working with Altan Khan's son to further the spread of Buddhism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was given the grandiose title?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sonam Gyatso</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who granted Sonam Gyatso the title of grandiose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Altan Khan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Sonam Gyatso send gifts to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zhang Juzheng</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Ming Chinese official?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zhang Juzheng</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Sonam Gyatso die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mongolia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Of the third Dalai Lama, China Daily states that the &quot;Ming dynasty showed him special favor by allowing him to pay tribute.&quot; China Daily then says that Sonam Gyatso was granted the title Dorjichang or Vajradhara Dalai Lama in 1587 [sic!], but China Daily does not mention who granted him the title.

The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for &quot;cursing&quot; him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new Ü-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595–1657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the Ü-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the Ü-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled. Goldstein writes that in this the &quot;Mongols were again playing a significant role in Tibetan affairs, this time as the military arm of the Dalai Lama.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Rinbung princes overthrown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1565</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took control of the whole of Central Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karma Phuntsok Namgyal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Karma Phuntsok Namgyal reign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1611–1621</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Ü-Tsang king have an alliance with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Karmapa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who refused an audience with the Ü-Tsang king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The fourth Dalai Lama</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered.

In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama &quot;supreme authority&quot; as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually &quot;expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,&quot; by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies. Goldstein states that the government of Güshi Khan and the Dalai Lama persecuted the Karma Kagyu sect, confiscated their wealth and property, and even converted their monasteries into Gelug monasteries. Rawski writes that this Mongol patronage allowed the Gelugpas to dominate the rival religious sects in Tibet.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Güshi Khan organize a welcome ceremony for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lozang Gyatso</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Güshi Khan present as a gift to the Dalai Lama?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his conquest of Tibet </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Güshi Khan enthrone the ruler of Tibet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he Dalai Lama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Güshi Khan grant the governing authority to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the regent Sonam Chöpel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The title of 'King of Tibet belonged to whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Güshi Khan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Meanwhile, the Chinese Ming dynasty fell to the rebellion of Li Zicheng (1606–1645) in 1644, yet his short-lived Shun dynasty was crushed by the Manchu invasion and the Han Chinese general Wu Sangui (1612–1678). China Daily states that when the following Qing dynasty replaced the Ming dynasty, it merely &quot;strengthened administration of Tibet.&quot; However, Kolmaš states that the Dalai Lama was very observant of what was going on in China and accepted a Manchu invitation in 1640 to send envoys to their capital at Mukden in 1642, before the Ming collapsed.

Patterson write that when the Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1644–1661) of the subsequent Qing dynasty invited the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso to Beijing in 1652, Shunzhi treated the Dalai Lama as an independent sovereign of Tibet. Patterson writes that this was an effort of Shunzhi to secure an alliance with Tibet that would ultimately lead to the establishment of Manchu rule over Mongolia.
