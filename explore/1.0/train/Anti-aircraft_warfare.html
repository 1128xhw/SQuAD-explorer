It may be used to protect naval, ground, and air forces in any location. However, for most countries the main effort has tended to be 'homeland defence'. NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare.

The fuse length was determined by time of flight, but the burning rate of the gunpowder was affected by altitude. The British pom-poms had only contact-fused ammunition. Zeppelins, being hydrogen filled balloons, were targets for incendiary shells and the British introduced these with airburst fuses, both shrapnel type-forward projection of incendiary 'pot' and base ejection of an incendiary stream.

These started replacing, or at least supplanting, similar gun-based SPAAG systems in the 1960s, and by the 1990s had replaced almost all such systems in modern armies.

The development of surface-to-air missiles began in Nazi Germany during the late World War II with missiles such as the Wasserfall, though no working system was deployed before the war's end, and represented new attempts to increase effectiveness of the anti-aircraft systems faced with growing threat from [bomber]s.

Fixed AA defences, using HAA and LAA, were established by the Army in key overseas places, notably Malta, Suez Canal and Singapore.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Poland and other European countries could not defend against what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German attack</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What battle marked the beginning of significant antiaircraft warfare?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was under command of the Air Defence UK orgnisation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Army's Anti-aircraft command</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Air Defence UK grew to have how many antiaircraft corps?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was formed in 1941 to protect airfields?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RAF regiment</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Britain had successful tested a new HAA gun, 3.6-inch, in 1918. In 1928 3.7-inch became the preferred solution, but it took 6 years to gain funding. Production of the QF 3.7-inch (94 mm) began in 1937; this gun was used both on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions. At the same time the Royal Navy adopted a new 4.5-inch (114 mm) gun in a twin turret, which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions, mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available. However, the performance of both 3.7 and 4.5-in guns was limited by their standard fuse No 199, with a 30-second running time, although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness. In 1939 a Machine Fuse Setter was introduced to eliminate manual fuse setting.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the successful test of the 3.6-inch HAA gun?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1918</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the 3.7-inch HAA gun become preferred?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1928 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What gun did the Royal Navy start using?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4.5-inch (114 mm) gun in a twin turret</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long of a running time did the Number 199 fuse have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30-second running time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was introduced in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Machine Fuse Setter</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Service trials demonstrated another problem however: that ranging and tracking the new high-speed targets was almost impossible.

Germany introduced the rapid-fire 2 cm FlaK 30 and later in the decade it was redesigned by Mauser-Werke and became the 2 cm FlaK 38. Nevertheless, while 20 mm was better than a machine gun and mounted on a very small trailer made it easy to move, its effectiveness was limited. Germany therefore added a 3.7 cm. The first, the 3.7 cm FlaK 18 developed by Rheinmetall in the early 1930s, was basically an enlarged 2 cm FlaK 30. It was introduced in 1935 and production stopped the following year. A redesigned gun 3.7 cm FlaK 36 entered service in 1938, it too had a two-wheel carriage. However, by the mid-1930s the Luftwaffe realised that there was still a coverage gap between 3.7 cm and 8.8 cm guns.

Most modern systems are usually either self-propelled (i.e. guns or missiles are mounted on a truck or tracked chassis) or easily towed. Even systems that consist of many components (transporter/erector/launchers, radars, command posts etc.) benefit from being mounted on a fleet of vehicles. In general, a fixed system can be identified, attacked and destroyed whereas a mobile system can show up in places where it is not expected. Soviet systems especially concentrate on mobility, after the lessons learnt in the Vietnam war between the USA and Vietnam.

This system of repeater electrical dials built on the arrangements introduced by British coast artillery in the 1880s, and coast artillery was the background of many AA officers. Similar systems were adopted in other countries and for example the later Sperry device, designated M3A3 in the US was also used by Britain as the Predictor AA No 2. Height finders were also increasing in size, in Britain, the World War I Barr &amp; Stroud UB 2 (7 feet optical base) was replaced by the UB 7 (9 feet optical base) and the UB 10 (18 feet optical base, only used on static AA sites). Goertz in Germany and Levallois in France produced 5 metre instruments.

The developments in the latest and relatively cheap short-range missiles have begun to replace autocannons in this role.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be deployed in fixed launchers but re-deploy at will?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Larger SAMs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the SAMs called that are launched by individuals in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MANPADS</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does MANPADS mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Man-Portable Air Defence Systems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are targets aquired for non-ManPAD SAMs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">air-search radar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Short range missiles are replacing what weapons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">autocannons</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, as stealth technology grows, so does anti-stealth technology. Multiple transmitter radars such as those from bistatic radars and low-frequency radars are said to have the capabilities to detect stealth aircraft. Advanced forms of thermographic cameras such as those that incorporate QWIPs would be able to optically see a Stealth aircraft regardless of the aircraft's RCS. In addition, Side looking radars, High-powered optical satellites, and sky-scanning, high-aperture, high sensitivity radars such as radio telescopes, would all be able to narrow down the location of a stealth aircraft under certain parameters. The newest SAM's have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets, with the most notable being the S-400, which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05 meter squared RCS from 90 km away.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What continues to grow along with stealth technology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-stealth technology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can detect stealth aircraft?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Multiple transmitter radars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can see stealth aircraft even with RCS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Advanced forms of thermographic cameras</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most notable SAM that can detect a stealth target?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the S-400</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far away can the S-400 detect a target?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90 km away</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
