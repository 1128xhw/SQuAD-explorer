Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula, it shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north and Turkey to the northeast. Greece consists of nine geographic regions: Macedonia, Central Greece, the Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, the Aegean Islands (including the Dodecanese and Cyclades), Thrace, Crete, and the Ionian Islands. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km (8,498 mi) in length, featuring a vast number of islands, of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres (9,573 ft).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what peninsula is Greece located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Balkan peninsula</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many geographic regions make up Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is the coastline of Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8,498 mi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of Greece's islands are inhabited?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">227</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the tallest mountain in Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mount Olympus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Greece has one of the longest histories of any country, and is considered the cradle of Western civilization, and as such, is the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, the Olympic Games, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, and Western drama, including both tragedy and comedy. Greece was first unified under Philip of Macedon in the fourth century BC. His son Alexander the Great rapidly conquered much of the ancient world, spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus River. Annexed by Rome in the second century BC, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The first century AD saw the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church, which shaped the modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox World. Falling under Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern nation state of Greece emerged in 1830 following the war of independence. Greece's rich historical legacy is reflected in large part by its 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, among the most in Europe and the world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person to bring all of Greece together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip of Macedon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the son of Philip of Macedon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexander the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Greece came part of what empire in the 2nd century BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rome</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Greek Orthodox Church started?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">first century AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year is considered the beginning of modern Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1830</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Greece is a democratic and developed country with an advanced high-income economy, a high quality of life and a very high standard of living.

These civilizations possessed writing, the Minoans writing in an undeciphered script known as Linear A, and the Mycenaeans in Linear B, an early form of Greek. The Mycenaeans gradually absorbed the Minoans, but collapsed violently around 1200 BC, during a time of regional upheaval known as the Bronze Age collapse.

A second invasion by the Persians followed in 480 BC. Despite a heroic resistance at Thermopylae by Spartans and other Greeks led by King Leonidas, and a simultaneous naval engagement at Artemisium,[page needed] Persian forces occupied Athens, which had been evacuated in time, as well as briefly overrunning half of Greece. Following decisive Greek victories in 480 and 479 BC at Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale, the Persians were forced to withdraw for a second time, marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their European territories. Led by Athens and Sparta, the Greek victories in the Greco-Persian Wars are considered a pivotal moment in world history, as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 500 BC, Greece was ruled over by who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persian Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What battle did Persia lose in 490 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Marathon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Spartans made their last stand at what battle location?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thermopylae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The battles between the Greeks and Persians are known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greco-Persian Wars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the Persians left Europe, the time period that followed was called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Golden Age of Athens</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states.

The epics of Homer inspired the Aeneid of Virgil, and authors such as Seneca the younger wrote using Greek styles. Roman heroes such as Scipio Africanus, tended to study philosophy and regarded Greek culture and science as an example to be followed. Similarly, most Roman emperors maintained an admiration for things Greek in nature. The Roman Emperor Nero visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the Ancient Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation.

The New Testament was written in Greek, and some of its sections (Corinthians, Thessalonians, Philippians, Revelation of St. John of Patmos) attest to the importance of churches in Greece in early Christianity. Nevertheless, much of Greece clung tenaciously to paganism, and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD, when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor Theodosius I in 391-392. The last recorded Olympic games were held in 393, and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed. In Athens and rural areas, paganism is attested well into the sixth century AD and even later. The closure of the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens by the emperor Justinian in 529 is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity, although there is evidence that the Academy continued its activities for some time after that. Some remote areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remained pagan until well into the 10th century AD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what language was the first book of the Bible conceived?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did early Greece practice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paganism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Olympics were last held in ancient Greece in what year? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">393</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Paganism was forbidden by what Roman Emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Theodosius I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Emperor closed the school in Athens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Justinian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From the 4th century, the Empire's Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of the Barbarian Invasions.

Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–1942, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and collaborators, the country's economy was ruined and the great majority of Greek Jews were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The Greek Resistance, one of the most effective resistance movements in Europe fought vehemently against the Nazis and their collaborators. The German occupiers committed numerous atrocities, mass executions, and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages in reprisals. In the course of the concerted anti-guerrilla campaign, hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1,000,000 Greeks left homeless.

The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Greek law says that every Sunday of the year is a what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">holiday</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many official Greek mandatory public holidays are there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Greek national holidays are there each year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eleven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the holidays regulated by law as optional?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Labour Day</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2011, it became apparent that the bail-out would be insufficient and a second bail-out amounting to €130 billion ($173 billion) was agreed in 2012, subject to strict conditions, including financial reforms and further austerity measures. As part of the deal, there was to be a 53% reduction in the Greek debt burden to private creditors and any profits made by Eurozone central banks on their holdings of Greek debt are to be repatriated back to Greece. Greece achieved a primary government budget surplus in 2013. In April 2014, Greece returned to the global bond market as it successfully sold €3 billion worth of five-year government bonds at a yield of 4.95%. Greece returned to growth after six years of economic decline in the second quarter of 2014, and was the Eurozone's fastest-growing economy in the third quarter.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in 2012, what was the amount of the bailout?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$173 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much debt to creditors was Greece suppose to reduce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">53%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Greece realize a budget surplus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did Greece make from a bond sale in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">€3 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After how many years did it take for Greece to gain back growth in the economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six years</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the assassination of Phillip II, his son Alexander III (&quot;The Great&quot;) assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of all Greek states in 334 BC. Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Alexander III was the son of whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phillip II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Alexander III invaded what empire after his father was killed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Alexander III Invade Persia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">334 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Persian Empire was conquered by Alexander by what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">330 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did Alexander III die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">323 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
