Roman emperor Augustus in 12 BC ordered the conquest of the Germans, but the catastrophic Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest resulted in the Roman Empire abandoning its plans to completely conquer Germany. Germanic peoples in Roman territory were culturally Romanized, and although much of Germany remained free of direct Roman rule, Rome deeply influenced the development of German society, especially the adoption of Christianity by the Germans who obtained it from the Romans. In Roman-held territories with Germanic populations, the Germanic and Roman peoples intermarried, and Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions intermingled. The adoption of Christianity would later become a major influence in the development of a common German identity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What emperor forced the Germanic tribes to the east side of the Rhine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Julius Caesar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what did Emperor Augustus order the conquest of the Germans? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12 BC </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Romans suffered a horrible defeat in there conquest of the Germans in what battle? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Battle of the Teutoburg Forest </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Roman's adoption of what religion would greatly influence the German society? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Through what act would Roman and German customs become intertwine? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germanic and Roman peoples intermarried</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Roman emperor ordered the conquest of the Germans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Augustus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did Germans adopt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What battle did Germans defeat the Romans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest r</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Germanic peoples during the Migrations Period came into contact with other peoples; in the case of the populations settling in the territory of modern Germany, they encountered Celts to the south, and Balts and Slavs towards the east. The Limes Germanicus was breached in AD 260. Migrating Germanic tribes commingled with the local Gallo-Roman populations in what is now Swabia and Bavaria. The arrival of the Huns in Europe resulted in Hun conquest of large parts of Eastern Europe, the Huns initially were allies of the Roman Empire who fought against Germanic tribes, but later the Huns cooperated with the Germanic tribe of the Ostrogoths, and large numbers of Germans lived within the lands of the Hunnic Empire of Attila. Attila had both Hunnic and Germanic families and prominent Germanic chiefs amongst his close entourage in Europe. The Huns living in Germanic territories in Eastern Europe adopted an East Germanic language as their lingua franca. A major part of Attila's army were Germans, during the Huns' campaign against the Roman Empire. After Attila's unexpected death the Hunnic Empire collapsed with the Huns disappearing as a people in Europe – who either escaped into Asia, or otherwise blended in amongst Europeans.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Migrations period Germans would encounter what groups in the east?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Balts and Slavs </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Migrations period Germans would encounter what group in the south?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Celts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Limes Germanicus was breached in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AD 260</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who allied with the Germans after previous fighting them along side the Romans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Huns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What leader had both prominent German and Hun families in his entourage throughout Europe? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Attila </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Limes Germanicus breached?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> AD 260</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Germans come in contact with to the south?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Celts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Germanic tribe did the Huns cooperate with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Ostrogoths</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language did the Huns adopt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> East Germanic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the Huns after Attila's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">either escaped into Asia, or otherwise blended in amongst Europeans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a &quot;German&quot; ethnicity were the Germanic tribes of the Saxons, Franci, Thuringii, Alamanni and Bavarii.

The varieties of the German language are still divided up into these groups. Linguists distinguish low Saxon, Franconian, Bavarian, Thuringian and Alemannic varieties in modern German. By the 9th century, the large tribes which lived on the territory of modern Germany had been united under the rule of the Frankish king Charlemagne, known in German as Karl der Große.

The Old Prussians were an ethnic group related to the Latvian and Lithuanian Baltic peoples. The former German state of Prussia took its name from the Baltic Prussians, although it was led by Germans who had assimilated the Old Prussians; the old Prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century. The Slavic people of the Teutonic-controlled Baltic were assimilated into German culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of Slavic and German families, including amongst the Prussia's aristocracy known as the Junkers. Prussian military strategist Karl von Clausewitz is a famous German whose surname is of Slavic origin.

Thus people who would be considered &quot;Germans&quot;, with a common culture, language, and worldview different from that of the surrounding rural peoples, colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as Bergen (in Norway), Stockholm (in Sweden), and Vyborg (now in Russia). The Hanseatic League was not exclusively German in any ethnic sense: many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as German. The Empire itself was not entirely German either.

After the Congress of Vienna, Austria and Prussia emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting. These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856, paving the way for German unification in the 1860s.

It was particularly influential during the years of the Weimar Republic with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. The Nazi era produced mostly propaganda films although the work of Leni Riefenstahl still introduced new aesthetics in film. From the 1960s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, Rainer Werner Fassbinder placed West-German cinema back onto the international stage with their often provocative films, while the Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft controlled film production in the GDR.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the original German cinematic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Max Skladanowsky</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of film were produced in the Nazi era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">propaganda</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who controls film production in the GDR?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did German cinema come back internationally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1960s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>More recently, films such as Das Boot (1981), The Never Ending Story (1984) Run Lola Run (1998), Das Experiment (2001), Good Bye Lenin!

You have become Europe's indispensable nation.&quot; According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. &quot;This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position at the center of the Continent.&quot; Heilbrunn believes that the adage, &quot;what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union&quot; has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Poland's foreign minister in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Radek Sikorski</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Germans trying to forget?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nazi past</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Germans trying to focus on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prussian history</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Europe's strongest economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Germany</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
