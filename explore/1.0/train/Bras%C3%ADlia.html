The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasília, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the &quot;Alvorada&quot; lies on a peninsula at the margins of Lake Paranoá. The principles of simplicity and modernity, that in the past characterized the great works of architecture, motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor. The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Brazil's president live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palácio da Alvorada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What principles of architecture was the Alvorada designed with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">simplicity and modernity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How large is the Alvorada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7,000 m2 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many floors does the Alvorada have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Brasilia's presidential residence open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1958</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil. It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília. As the seat of government, the term &quot;Planalto&quot; is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto. The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the &quot;Planalto,&quot; including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000 m2. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many floors does the Planalto have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How large is the Planalto?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">36,000 m2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the President's offices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palácio do Planalto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the Planalto?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Oscar Niemeyer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the VP's offices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palácio do Planalto</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing.

The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the central area of Brasília, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to Brasília's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars. The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasília's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each. During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Brasilia's airport add a second runway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many passengers came through Brasilia's airport in 2007?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11,119,872</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many movie theaters are in Brasilia's airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many vendor spaces are in Brasilia's airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">136 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many parking spaces are there at Brasilia's airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,200</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2014, the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totalling 28 in all.
