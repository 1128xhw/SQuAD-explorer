Some recent historians begin the period in the 1620s, with the start of the scientific revolution. The Philosophes, the French term for the philosophers of the period, widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons and coffee houses, and through printed books and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the church, and paved the way for the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and neo-classicism, trace their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Enlightenment begin according to French historians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1715</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Recent historians begin the period of Enlightenment in the 1620's which was also the start of what revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scientific revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A variety of movements such as liberalism and neoclassicism's intellectual heritage can be traced back to what period of time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Enlightenment.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the French term for philosophers in the period of Enlightenment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Philosophes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Louis XIV die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1715</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the French Revolution begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1789</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade did the scientific revolution begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1620s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Francis Hutcheson, a moral philosopher, described the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, &quot;the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers&quot;.

Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be &quot;representative&quot; and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Hobbes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Thomas Hobbes ushered in the new debate of social contract theory through which work of his?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leviathan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Locke base his governance philosophy on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social contract theory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Locke base his governance philosphy in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social contract theory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which English philosopher wrote Leviathan in 1651?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Thomas Hobbes </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the view that all legitimate political power must be &quot;representative?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Hobbes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Hobbes' ideas led to the distinction between civil society and the state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the artificial character of the political order</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Both Rousseau and Locke's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of natural rights, which are not a result of law or custom, but are things that all men have in pre-political societies, and are therefore universal and inalienable. The most famous natural right formulation comes from John Locke in his Second Treatise, when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke the law of nature is grounded on mutual security, or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, and the right to preserve life and property. Locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving yourself goes against the law of nature; you cannot surrender your own rights, your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you. Additionally, Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does John Locke define mutual security?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Locke's idea of natural rights include?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">perfect equality and freedom, and the right to preserve life and property</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did John Locke believe that one person cannot enslave another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because it is morally reprehensible</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was John Locke's one exception to denouncing slavery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which of John Locke's works are natural rights most famously defined and discussed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second Treatise</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the Thirty Years' War. Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in God. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. John Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an &quot;unprejudiced examination&quot; of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of Christianity to be a belief in Christ the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate. Thomas Jefferson in the Jefferson Bible went further; he dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels, and the resurrection of Jesus after his death. He tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the New Testament.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who dropped any passages dealing with miracles or visitations of angels from his work the Jefferson Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Jefferson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Enlightenment era religious commentary was, in part, a response to which war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thirty Years' War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Enlightenment mean for moderate Christians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a return to simple Scripture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did John Locke want to foster or avoid increased detailed debate on the essence of Christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">avoid</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Enlightenment took hold in most European countries, often with a specific local emphasis.

Government responses varied widely. In France, the government was hostile, and the philosophes fought against its censorship, sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile.

From the start there was a Counter-Enlightenment in which conservative and clerical defenders of traditional religion attacked materialism and skepticism as evil forces that encouraged immorality. By 1794, they pointed to the Terror during the French Revolution as confirmation of their predictions. As the Enlightenment was ending, Romantic philosophers argued that excessive dependence on reason was a mistake perpetuated by the Enlightenment, because it disregarded the bonds of history, myth, faith and tradition that were necessary to hold society together.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By 1794, what did those against the Enlightenment point to as confirmation of their predictions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Terror during the French Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of philosophers argued that excessive dependence on reason was a mistake perpetuated by the Enlightenment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romantic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two ideas did conservative and clerical defenders of traditional religion attack as evil forces that encouraged immorality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">materialism and skepticism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment; the beginning of the 18th century (1701) or the middle of the 17th century (1650) are often used as epochs. French historians usually place the period, called the Siècle des Lumières (Century of Enlightenments), between 1715 and 1789, from the beginning of the reign of Louis XV until the French Revolution. If taken back to the mid-17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to Descartes' Discourse on Method, published in 1637. In France, many cited the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687. It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his cogito ergo sum published in 1637. As to its end, most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the French Revolution of 1789 or the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars (1804–15) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most scholars use the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars or which other battle as a convenient date to end the Enlightenment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French Revolution </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">French historians generally use the beginning of which King's reign to date the start of the Enlightenment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Louis XV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do French historians commonly call the Age of Enlightenment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Siècle des Lumières (Century of Enlightenments)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Descartes' Discourse on Method published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1637</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Issaac Newton's Principia Mathematica published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1687</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of capitalism. The modern nation state, in its consolidation of public power, created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the public sphere. Capitalism also increased society's autonomy and self-awareness, and an increasing need for the exchange of information. As the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of institutions; the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters. In France, the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy's move from the King's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720, since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations, especially fine paintings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The creation of the public sphere is associated with the rise of capitalism and which other historical trend?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rise of the modern nation state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What increased society's autonomy, self-awareness, and need for exchange of information?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Capitalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the aristocracy move from the King's palace at Versailles to Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1720</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The desire to explore, record and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact on music publications.

This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste, and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was Charles Burney's A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period (1776), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time. Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment.

On one end of the spectrum was the Bibliothèque Bleue, a collection of cheaply produced books published in Troyes, France. Intended for a largely rural and semi-literate audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While some historians have argued against the Enlightenment's penetration into the lower classes, the Bibliothèque Bleue represents at least a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability. Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material for a small price started to appear, and occasionally bookstores would offer a small lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, journals and sometimes even popular novels to their customers. The Tatler and The Spectator, two influential periodicals sold from 1709 to 1714, were closely associated with coffee house culture in London, being both read and produced in various establishments in the city. This is an example of the triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: reading material was often obtained, read, discussed and even produced on the premises.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Bibliotheque Bleue located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Troyes, France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what audience were the books of the Bibliotheque Bleue written?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">largely rural and semi-literate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two influential periodicals  were closely associated with London coffee house culture and were sold from 1909 to 1714? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Tatler and The Spectator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What collection of cheaply produced books represents the lower class' desire to participate in the Enlightenment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bibliothèque Bleue</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The target audience of natural history was French polite society, evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works. Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for erudition – many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. However, natural history was often a political affair. As E. C. Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists &quot;slipped between the natural world and the social ... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural, but also the dominance of the natural over the social&quot;. The idea of taste (le goût) was a social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society. In this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time, but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class. From this basis, naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the target audience of natural history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French polite society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many texts had explicit instructive purposes as Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">erudition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The idea of what quality was a social indicator that provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">taste (le goût)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was the target audience of natural history evidenced more by the price of publications or its specific discourse of the genre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">specific discourse of the genre</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first technical dictionary was drafted by John Harris and entitled Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences.

The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as &quot;a Work entirely New&quot; that would include &quot;short and easie  [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.&quot; The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Francesco Algarotti, writing for a growing female audience, published Il Newtonianism per le dame, which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by Elizabeth Carter. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by Henry Pembarton. His A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class. During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves.

While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, in which the government's authority lies in the consent of the governed, is necessary for man to live in civil society. Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law; in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty and property. However, when one citizen breaks the Law of Nature, both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an &quot;unbiased judge&quot; or common authority, such as courts, to appeal to. Contrastingly, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that &quot;civil man&quot; is corrupted, while &quot;natural man&quot; has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established. Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom. This is embodied in the sovereignty of the general will, the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau agree was necessary for a man to live in civil society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> social contract</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Discourse on Inequality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rousseau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which theorist wrote Two Treatises of Government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Locke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what reason did Rousseau feel people joined into civil society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From which state does Locke believe it is virtually improssible to break free?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">state of war</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger national states.

There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market – such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese – found journal success more difficult, and more often than not, a more international language was used instead.

They fostered new codes of conduct – including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability – &quot;liberty, fraternity, and equality&quot; Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism. Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France – by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations. The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden and Russia. One example was the &quot;Illuminati&quot; founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons but was never part of the movement.

Monarchs also resented the idea of their subjects convening as one to discuss political matters, especially those concerning foreign affairs - rulers thought political affairs to be their business only, a result of their supposed divine right to rule. </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which venue created a unique environment in which people from many different walks of life could gather and share ideas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Coffeehouses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Coffehouses were criticized by which group of people, fearing the possiblity of an environmentin which class was disregarded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nobles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which societal group believed they held a divine right to rule and resented the idea of their subjects convening to discuss political matters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Monarchs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What societal group derived much of their power from the disparity between classes of people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Monarchs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did natural history in particular become increasingly popular amoung the upper or lower classes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">upper </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of history encompassed botany, zoology, meteorolgy, hydrology, and mineralogy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural history </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the Histoire naturelle des insectes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Masonic lodges created a private model for public affairs. They &quot;reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives.&quot; In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. In French lodges, for example, the line &quot;As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened&quot; was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to &quot;initiate the unenlightened&quot;. This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade did the first Masonic lodges appear on the Continent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1730s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Freemason embodiment of what country's values was seen as threatening by Continental authorities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Parisian lodge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which lodges assigned themselves the duty to &quot;initate the unenlightened&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the masonic term for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grand Architect</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Coffeehouses represent a turning point in history during which people discovered that they could have enjoyable social lives within their communities. Coffeeshops became homes away from home for many who sought, for the first time, to engage in discourse with their neighbors and discuss intriguing and thought-provoking matters, especially those regarding philosophy to politics. Coffeehouses were essential to the Enlightenment, for they were centers of free-thinking and self-discovery. Although many coffeehouse patrons were scholars, a great deal were not. Coffeehouses attracted a diverse set of people, including not only the educated wealthy but also members of the bourgeoisie and the lower class. While it may seem positive that patrons, being doctors, lawyers, merchants, etc. represented almost all classes, the coffeeshop environment sparked fear in those who sought to preserve class distinction. One of the most popular critiques of the coffeehouse claimed that it &quot;allowed promiscuous association among people from different rungs of the social ladder, from the artisan to the aristocrat&quot; and was therefore compared to Noah's Ark, receiving all types of animals, clean or unclean. This unique culture served as a catalyst for journalism when Joseph Addison and Richard Steele recognized its potential as an audience. Together, Steele and Addison published The Spectator (1711), a daily publication which aimed, through fictional narrator Mr. Spectator, both to entertain and to provoke discussion regarding serious philosophical matters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which venue represents a turning point in history during which people discovered that they could have enjoyable social lives within their communities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Coffeehouses </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Coffehouses were essential to what movement by becoming centers of free-thinking and self-discovery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Enlightenment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was The Spectator published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1711</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which literary work used the fictional narrator Mr. Spectator to entertain and provoke discussion regarding serious philosophical matters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Spectator </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The major opponent of Freemasonry was the Roman Catholic Church, so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Spain, and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between what Davies calls the reactionary Church and enlightened Freemasonry.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, &quot;In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.&quot; Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, &quot;prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].&quot;. He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual &quot;could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Thomas Paine, what is the definition of Deism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which philosopher argued that atheists could indeed be moral men?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pierre Bayle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which philosopher argued that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Voltaire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who felt that since atheists gave themselves no Supreme Authority and no law, they were more likely to disrupt society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Voltaire </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The word &quot;public&quot; implies the highest level of inclusivity – the public sphere by definition should be open to all.

It also contributed to the enhancement of scientists' social status, considering them to be the &quot;most useful of all citizens&quot;. Academies demonstrate the rising interest in science along with its increasing secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members (13 percent).

They perceived themselves as &quot;interpreters of the sciences for the people&quot;.

The study of science, under the heading of natural philosophy, was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and natural history, which included anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and zoology. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally; Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and zoology are all studies of which subject?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural history</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rousseau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development during the Enlightenment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scientific societies and academies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which century is considered by some as a &quot;drab&quot; period, however saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics, the development of biological taxonomy, a new understanding of magnetism, and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Voltaire and Emilie du Chatelet populatized which scientific philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Newtonianism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Science came to play a leading role in Enlightenment discourse and thought.

During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies.

In this view, the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully, and therefore violent revolution was the result.

It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject, that the subject tacitly consents; Hume says that the subjects would &quot;never imagine that their consent made him sovereign&quot;, rather the authority did so. Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 An Essay on the History of Civil Society, Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without &quot;signing&quot; a social contract.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what work did Ferguson explain how humans advanced from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without &quot;signing&quot; a social contract?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">An Essay on the History of Civil Society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Ferguson publish An Essay on the History of Civil Society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1767</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many stages of progress did Ferguson theorize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who, along with Adam Ferguson, criticized the idea of social contract theorists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Hume</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Russia, the government began to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences in the mid-18th century.

Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, &quot;general works&quot; (those books &quot;that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority&quot;) demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature.

The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the Encyclopédie more accessible to the non-elite.

Boyle was &quot;a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate,&quot; and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy. This is where the Royal Society came into play: witnessing had to be a &quot;collective act&quot;, and the Royal Society's assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations. However, not just any witness was considered to be credible; &quot;Oxford professors were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants.&quot; Two factors were taken into account: a witness's knowledge in the area; and a witness's &quot;moral constitution&quot;.

On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism. He argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds.

An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education. Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured &quot;to make information available to the greatest number of people.&quot; As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. Sir Isaac Newton's celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused an increasingly literate population to develop in the Enlightenment era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a high rise in the availability of food</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of paying more for food, on what did people spend their money?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ideal endeavoured to make information available to the greatest number of people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Popularization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Isaac Newton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which work of Isaac Newton was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze it in the vernacular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
