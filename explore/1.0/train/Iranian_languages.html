The speakers of Iranian languages are known as Iranian peoples. Historical Iranian languages are grouped in three stages: Old Iranian (until 400 BCE), Middle Iranian (400 BCE – 900 CE), and New Iranian (since 900 CE). Of the Old Iranian languages, the better understood and recorded ones are Old Persian (a language of Achaemenid Iran) and Avestan (the language of the Avesta). Middle Iranian languages included Middle Persian (a language of Sassanid Iran), Parthian, and Bactrian.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term meaning Iranian languages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iranic languages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Iranic languages a subgroup of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indo-Iranian languages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Indo-Iranian languages a subset of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indo-European language family</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the change from Old Iranian to Middle Iranian occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a Sassanid language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle Persian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As of 2008, there were an estimated 150–200 million native speakers of Iranian languages.

The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as &quot;Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan&quot;, and &quot;Younger Avestan&quot;. These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its &quot;old&quot; characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ancient religious document exists in two versions and includes Old Iranian language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Avestan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the contemporary name of the religion which Avesta was part of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zoroastrianism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language shows a level of maturity corresponding to Old Avestan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rigvedic Sanskrit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language shows the same level of development as Younger Avestan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old Persian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In addition to Old Persian and Avestan, which are the only directly attested Old Iranian languages, all Middle Iranian languages must have had a predecessor &quot;Old Iranian&quot; form of that language, and thus can all be said to have had an (at least hypothetical) &quot;Old&quot; form. Such hypothetical Old Iranian languages include Carduchi (the hypothetical predecessor to Kurdish) and Old Parthian. Additionally, the existence of unattested languages can sometimes be inferred from the impact they had on neighbouring languages. Such transfer is known to have occurred for Old Persian, which has (what is called) a &quot;Median&quot; substrate in some of its vocabulary.

Certain is only that Avestan (all forms) and Old Persian are distinct, and since Old Persian is &quot;western&quot;, and Avestan was not Old Persian, Avestan acquired a default assignment to &quot;eastern&quot;. Confusing the issue is the introduction of a western Iranian substrate in later Avestan compositions and redactions undertaken at the centers of imperial power in western Iran (either in the south-west in Persia, or in the north-west in Nisa/Parthia and Ecbatana/Media).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two main divisions of Iranian tongues?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">western and eastern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which language is associated with the western branch of Iranian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old Persian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which language is associated with the eastern branch of Iranian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Avestan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Two of the earliest dialectal divisions among Iranian indeed happen to not follow the later division into Western and Eastern blocks.

The Saffarid dynasty in particular was the first in a line of many dynasties to officially adopt the new language in 875 CE. Dari may have been heavily influenced by regional dialects of eastern Iran, whereas the earlier Pahlavi standard was based more on western dialects. This new prestige dialect became the basis of Standard New Persian. Medieval Iranian scholars such as Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa (8th century) and Ibn al-Nadim (10th century) associated the term &quot;Dari&quot; with the eastern province of Khorasan, while they used the term &quot;Pahlavi&quot; to describe the dialects of the northwestern areas between Isfahan and Azerbaijan, and &quot;Pârsi&quot; (&quot;Persian&quot; proper) to describe the Dialects of Fars.

The script was however subsequently Cyrillicized in the 1930s by the Soviet government.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the new form of writing introduced by the spread of Islam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arabic script</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did usage of Middle Persian script fall off?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second half of the 8th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What script was converted to Latin in the 1920s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tajik script</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Tajik script converted to Cyrillic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1930s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who catalyzed the conversion of Tajik script into Cyrillic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Soviet government</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for Western Iran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Khuzestan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two languages that were forced out by the spread of Arabic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sogdian and Bactrian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what century had the area inhabited by Sarmatians been absorbed by pre-Slavic people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6th century AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can the remnants of Yaghnobi be found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zarafshan valley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ossetic is a version of which Scythian language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saka</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
