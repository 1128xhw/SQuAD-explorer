It is the thirteenth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released worldwide in December 2006.[b]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What category of game is Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">action-adventure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What consoles can be used to play Twilight Princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GameCube and Wii</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Twilight Princess launched in North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When could GameCube owners purchase Twilight Princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company developed Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nintendo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Legend of Zelda:Twilight Princess originally planned for release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Wii version of Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The story focuses on series protagonist Link, who tries to prevent Hyrule from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension known as the Twilight Realm.

Midna is moved by Zelda's sacrifice, and begins to care more about Link and the fate of the light world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Link assist Midna in collection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fused Shadows</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who attacks Link and Midna when they've finished their collection tasks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What weapon can transform Link back to his original self?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Master Sword</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who saves Midna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zelda</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do the Zoras come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lanayru</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Link help Midna find?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fused Shadows</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ambushes Link and Midna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Link discover he needs to find to return to human form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Master Sword</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sacrifices herself to save Midna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zelda</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After gaining the Master Sword, Link is cleansed of the magic that kept him in wolf form, obtaining the Shadow Crystal. Now able to use it to switch between both forms at will, Link is led by Midna to the Mirror of Twilight located deep within the Gerudo Desert, the only known gateway between the Twilight Realm and Hyrule. However, they discover that the mirror is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed. Assisted by an underground resistance group they meet in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the Mirror, defeating those they infected. Once the portal has been restored, Midna is revealed to be the true ruler of the Twilight Realm, usurped by Zant when he cursed her into her current form. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that Zant's coup was made possible when he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for Zant's assistance in conquering Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows, but destroys Zant after learning that only Ganondorf's death can release her from her curse. Returning to Hyrule, Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle, with a lifeless Zelda suspended above his head. Ganondorf fights Link by possessing Zelda's body and eventually by transforming into a beast, but Link defeats him and Midna is able to resurrect Zelda.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Link obtain that gives him control over his transformations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shadow Crystal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Midna take Link after he acquires the Master Sword?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mirror of Twilight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Mirror of Twilight used to fight prior to Zant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ganondorf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Ganondorf located after Zant's defeat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hyrule Castle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose body is used as a proxy by Ganondorf in order to fight Link?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zelda's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What allows Link to switch between his two forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shadow Crystal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only known gateway between Twilight Realm &amp; Hyrule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gerudo Desert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is revealed as the true ruler of Twilight Realm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Midna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Zant form a pact with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ganondorf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Ganondorf transform into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">beast</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ganondorf then revives, and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadows.

At the following year's Game Developers Conference, director Eiji Aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game's sequel was in development under the working title The Wind Waker 2; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor. Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience. Concerned that the sequel would have the same problem, Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru Miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic Zelda game that would appeal to the North American market. Miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the game's presentation, suggested the team's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations. He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in Ocarina of Time, particularly horseback combat.[l]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Nintendo reveal the start of development on what would become Twilight Princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what event was a potential follow-up to The Wind Waker mentioned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Game Developers Conference</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What region of the world did Nintendo want to design the next Legend of Zelda game for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North America</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one feature that could not be implemented in Ocarina of Time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">horseback combat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Nintendo announce a new Legend of Zelda was in the works for Gamecube?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the director that unintentionally announced a Zelda game was in the works?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eiji Aonuma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the specific area of gameplay that had not been done in Ocarina of Time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">horseback combat</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In four months, Aonuma's team managed to present realistic horseback riding,[l] which Nintendo later revealed to the public with a trailer at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2004.

In A Link to the Past, Link travels between a &quot;Light World&quot; and a &quot;Dark World&quot;; in Ocarina of Time, as well as in Oracle of Ages, Link travels between two different time periods. The Zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series' latest installment. It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the Dark World of A Link to the Past.[m] The story of the game was created by Aonuma, and later underwent several changes by scenario writers Mitsuhiro Takano and Aya Kyogoku. Takano created the script for the story scenes, while Kyogoku and Takayuki Ikkaku handled the actual in-game script. Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed The Minish Cap for the Game Boy Advance. When he returned, he found the Twilight Princess team struggling. Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link's character unbelievable. Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in Phantom Hourglass, which was being developed with touch controls for the Nintendo DS. At the same time, the Wii was under development with the code name &quot;Revolution&quot;. Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and suggested that Aonuma consider using it.[n]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Link morph into in A Link to the Past?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rabbit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aonuma left the Twilight Princess development team to work on which other game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Minish Cap</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the working name for the Wii prior to release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who proposed that the Wii Remote be used in the control scheme for Twilight Princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miyamoto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the script for the story scenes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mitsuhiro Takano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What device seemed well-suited for Link's arrow shooting ability?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wii Remote</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Aonuma had anticipated creating a Zelda game for what would later be called the Wii, but had assumed that he would need to complete Twilight Princess first.

Aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed, but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a GameCube release. Developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release, still disappointing the consumer. Satoru Iwata felt that having both versions would satisfy users in the end, even though they would have to wait for the finished product.

Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller-functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and Time reported this soon after. However, support for the Wii controller did not make it into the GameCube release.

Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of &quot;forcing&quot; users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use. He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease.[q] The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses.[r] In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword. To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures—something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see. This reintroduced the problem of using a right-handed swing to control a left-handed sword attack. The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game—everything was made a mirror image.[s] Link was now right-handed, and references to &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; were switched around. The GameCube version, however, was left with the original orientation. The Twilight Princess player's guide focuses on the Wii version, but has a section in the back with mirror-image maps for GameCube users.[t]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did early users find hard to use about the game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">control scheme</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Using items in the game took over the controls used for what weapon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sword</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wanted gestures implemented for sword control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">E3 attendees</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Twilight Princess was finally released for Wii, in what hand did Link wield his sword?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">right</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What features did Aonuma work to improve after the demo complaints?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comfort and ease</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The game's score was composed by Toru Minegishi and Asuka Ohta, with series regular Koji Kondo serving as the sound supervisor.

Both six- and seven-track versions of the game's soundtrack were released on November 19, 2006, as part of a Nintendo Power promotion and bundled with replicas of the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of instruments are favored by Kondo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">live</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people would be in the orchestra Kondo imagined using for the soundtrack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the soundtrack of Twilight Princess made available?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 19, 2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which publication was associated with the soundtrack release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nintendo Power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made the requests for Kondo to use orchestral music throughout the game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Media</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were track versions of the game's sountrack released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 19, 2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were replicas of the Master Sword and Hylian Shield bundled with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soundtrack</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the discovery of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Wii version of Twilight Princess, an exploit known as the &quot;Twilight Hack&quot; was developed, allowing the execution of custom code from a Secure Digital (SD) card on the console.

Game Informer called it &quot;so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer&quot;. GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as &quot;a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation&quot;. Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as &quot;the single greatest videogame experience&quot;. Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that &quot;the cutscenes are the best ever in Zelda games&quot;. Regarding the Wii version, GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann said the Wii controls felt &quot;tacked-on&quot;, although 1UP.com said the remote-swinging sword attacks were &quot;the most impressive in the entire series&quot;. Gaming Nexus considered Twilight Princess's soundtrack to be the best of this generation, though IGN criticized its MIDI-formatted songs for lacking &quot;the punch and crispness&quot; of their orchestrated counterparts. Hyper's Javier Glickman commended the game for its &quot;very long quests, superb Wii controls and being able to save anytime&quot;. However, he criticised it for &quot;no voice acting, no orchestral score and slightly outdated graphics&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which publications reported some issues with the graphics of Twilight Princess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">IGN and GameSpy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which journalist criticized the Wii version for its controls?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jeff Gerstmann</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which game publication does Jeff Gerstmann work for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GameSpot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which game journalist was perturbed by a lack of voiced dialogue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Javier Glickman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which publication does Javier Glickman write for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hyper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 2 critics suggested the game had blurry textures and low resolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">IGN and GameSpy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What critic considered the CD to be the best of the generation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gaming Nexus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who specifically commended the game for the very long quests?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Javier Glickman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Twilight Princess received the awards for Best Artistic Design, Best Original Score, and Best Use of Sound from IGN for its GameCube version.
