It also remained a largely obscure format in Europe and Australia. By contrast, the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, being the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s. Its superior video and audio quality did make it a somewhat popular choice among videophiles and film enthusiasts during its lifespan.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did LaserDisks offer higher or lower quality sound and picture than VHS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">higher-quality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why didn't LaserDisk gain popularity in North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high costs for the players and video titles themselves and the inability to record TV programming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With whom was LaserDisk a popular choice for it's picture and sound quality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">videophiles and film enthusiasts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city was LaserDisk used as a popular rental medium in the 1990s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hong Kong</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>LaserDisc was first available on the market, in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1978, two years after the introduction of the VHS VCR, and four years before the introduction of the CD (which is based on laser disc technology).

Players were still exported to North America from Japan until the end of 2001. The format has retained some popularity among American collectors, and to a greater degree in Japan, where the format was better supported and more prevalent during its life. In Europe, LaserDisc always remained an obscure format. It was chosen by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for the BBC Domesday Project in the mid-1980s, a school-based project to commemorate 900 years since the original Domesday Book in England.

Although appearing similar to compact discs or DVDs, LaserDiscs used analog video stored in the composite domain (having a video bandwidth approximately equivalent to the 1-inch (25 mm) C-Type VTR format) with analog FM stereo sound and PCM digital audio. The LaserDisc at its most fundamental level was still recorded as a series of pits and lands much like CDs, DVDs, and even Blu-ray Discs are today. However, while the encoding is of a binary nature, the information is encoded as analog pulse width modulation with a 50% duty cycle, where the information is contained in the lengths and spacing of the pits. In true digital media the pits, or their edges, directly represent 1s and 0s of a binary digital information stream. Early LaserDiscs featured in 1978 were entirely analog but the format evolved to incorporate digital stereo sound in CD format (sometimes with a TOSlink or coax output to feed an external DAC), and later multi-channel formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How large was a standard LaserDisc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 cm (12 in) in diameter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What numbers are used in Binary information coding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1s and 0s </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were the ealiest LaserDiscs in 1978 analog or digitally formatted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">analog</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As Pioneer introduced Digital Audio to LaserDisc in 1985, they further refined the CAA format. CAA55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds, reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of Digital Audio. Several titles released between 1985 and 1987 were analog audio only due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc (e.g., Back to the Future). By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60, allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds. Pioneer further refined CAA, offering CAA45, encoding 45 minutes of material, but filling the entire playback surface of the side. Used on only a handful of titles, CAA65 offered 65 minutes 5 seconds of playback time per side. There are a handful of titles pressed by Technidisc that used CAA50. The final variant of CAA is CAA70, which could accommodate 70 minutes of playback time per side. There are not any known uses of this format on the consumer market.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the length capacity of the CAA55 format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">55 minutes 5 seconds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Back to the Future released with analog sound?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the maximum length of the CAA60 format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60 minutes 5 seconds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many works were released to the public with the CAA70 format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">There are not any known uses of this format on the consumer market</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sound could be stored in either analog or digital format and in a variety of surround sound formats; NTSC discs could carry two analog audio tracks, plus two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, which were (EFM, CIRC, 16-bit and 44.056 kHz sample rate). PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term &quot;LaserVision&quot; is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while &quot;LaserDisc&quot; is used for those with digital audio. The digital sound signal in both formats are EFM-encoded as in CD. Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS—which are now common on DVD titles—first became available on LaserDisc, and Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan, is among the first home video releases ever to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which carry Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs store Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special &quot;AC-3 RF&quot; output and an external demodulator in addition to an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator was necessary to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could handle. DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS sound required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the difference between LaserDisc and LaserVision in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;LaserVision&quot; is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while &quot;LaserDisc&quot; is used for those with digital audio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Phantom Menace was one of the first home videos to use what sound format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sound formatting do DVDs use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dolby Digital audio in digital form</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the mid to late 1990s many higher-end AV receivers included the demodulator circuit specifically for the LaserDisc players RF modulated Dolby Digital AC-3 signal.

Many early and lower-end LD players had poor analog audio components, and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks, making digital soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts. Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option, but many of those movies received digital sound in later re-issues by Universal, and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on. Many discs that had originally carried old analog stereo tracks received new Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround tracks instead, often in addition to digital tracks, helping boost sound quality. Later analog discs also applied CX Noise Reduction, which improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was sound quality from disc to disc and between players consistent or varied?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">varied greatly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was analog or digital formatting more popular with enthusiasts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">digital </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What result did adding CX Noise Reduction have on analog discs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company added digital sound option when re-releasing movies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Universal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Both AC-3 and DTS surround audio were clumsily implemented on LaserDiscs, leading to some interesting player- and disc-dependent issues. A disc that included AC-3 audio forfeited the right analog audio channel to the modulated AC-3 RF stream. If the player did not have an AC-3 output available, the next most attractive playback option would be the digital Dolby Surround or stereo audio tracks. The reason for this is the RF signal needs to bypass the audio circuitry in order to be properly processed by the demodulator. If either the player did not support digital audio tracks (common in older players), or the disc did not include digital audio tracks at all (uncommon for a disc which is mastered with an AC-3 track), the only remaining option was to fall back to a monophonic presentation of the left analog audio track. However, many older analog-only players not only failed to output AC-3 streams correctly, but were not even aware of their potential existence. Such a player will happily play the analog audio tracks verbatim, resulting in garbage (static) output in the right channel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which channel would not work in conjunction with AC-3 audio?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">right analog audio channel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What audio playback options were available if an AC-3 output was not present?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">digital Dolby Surround or stereo audio tracks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens to the right channel in a player that doesn't recognize AC-3?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">garbage (static) output</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Only one 5.1 surround sound option exists on a given LaserDisc (either Dolby Digital or DTS), so if surround sound is desired, the disc must be matched to the capabilities of the playback equipment (LD Player and Receiver/Decoder) by the purchaser.

The LaserVision Association, made up of MCA, Universal-Pioneer, IBM, and Philips/Magnavox, was formed to standardize the technical specifications of the format (which had been causing problems for the consumer market) and finally named the system officially as &quot;LaserVision&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did VLP stand for in English-speaking countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Video Long-Play</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first consumer VLP player?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Magnavox VH-8000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group officially chose the name &quot;Laservision&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The LaserVision Association</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Laservision Association was comprised of which companies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> MCA, Universal-Pioneer, IBM, and Philips/Magnavox</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pioneer Electronics also entered the optical disc market in 1977 as a 50/50 joint-venture with MCA called Universal-Pioneer and manufacturing MCA designed industrial players under the MCA DiscoVision name (the PR-7800 and PR-7820). For the 1980 launch of the first Universal-Pioneer player, the VP-1000 was noted as a &quot;laser disc player&quot;, although the &quot;LaserDisc&quot; logo displayed clearly on the device. In 1981, &quot;LaserDisc&quot; was used exclusively for the medium itself, although the official name was &quot;LaserVision&quot; (as seen at the beginning of many LaserDisc releases just before the start of the film). However, as Pioneer reminded numerous video magazines and stores in 1984, LaserDisc was a trademarked word, standing only for LaserVision products manufactured for sale by Pioneer Video or Pioneer Electronics. A 1984 Ray Charles ad for the LD-700 player bore the term &quot;Pioneer LaserDisc brand videodisc player&quot;. From 1981 until the early 1990s, all properly licensed discs carried the LaserVision name and logo, even Pioneer Artists titles.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company joined a 50/50 partnership with MCA in 1977?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pioneer Electronics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the first Universal-Pioneer player released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first Universal-Pioneer player?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the VP-1000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which singer did an ad for the LD-700 player in 1984?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ray Charles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras. Also, the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is the only format to include the cut scene of Harrison Ford playing the part of the school headmaster telling off Elliott for letting the frogs free in the biology class.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other companies did MCA manufacture discs for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What quirk is present in MCA's release of Howard the Duck?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is unique about the LaserDisc release of E.T.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only format to include the cut scene of Harrison Ford playing the part of the school headmaster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which film is only available with its original score in LD format , even today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Electric Horseman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>LaserDisc had a number of advantages over VHS.

It could handle analog and digital audio where VHS was mostly analog only (VHS can have PCM audio in professional applications but is uncommon), and the NTSC discs could store multiple audio tracks. This allowed for extras like director's commentary tracks and other features to be added onto a film, creating &quot;Special Edition&quot; releases that would not have been possible with VHS. Disc access was random and chapter based, like the DVD format, meaning that one could jump to any point on a given disc very quickly.

A disc can be stamped out in a matter of seconds whereas duplicating videotape required a complex bulk tape duplication mechanism and was a time-consuming process. However, by the end of the 1980s, average disc-pressing prices were over $5.00 per two-sided disc, due to the large amount of plastic material and the costly glass-mastering process needed to make the metal stamper mechanisms. Due to the larger volume of demand, videocassettes quickly became much cheaper to duplicate, costing as little as $1.00 by the beginning of the 1990s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were Laserdiscs initially cheaper or more costly to produce than their VHS counterparts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cheaper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many parts does a VHS tape have that must be manufactured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at least 14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did LaserDiscs cost to produce by the end of the 1980s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$5.00 per two-sided disc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did VHS cost to produce by the 1990s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as little as $1.00</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). Also, the tape was thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were Laserdiscs or VHS more durable in the long run?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">LaserDiscs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is physical contact with a VHS tape less desirable than an optical reading?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">progressive wear with each use</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do VHS tapes store their information?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> magnetic coating</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>LaserDisc was a composite video format: the luminance (black and white) and chrominance (color) information were transmitted in one signal, separated by the receiver.

Early DVD releases held the potential to surpass their LaserDisc counterparts, but often managed only to match them for image quality, and in some cases, the LaserDisc version was preferred. However, proprietary human-assisted encoders manually operated by specialists can vastly reduce the incidence of artifacts, depending on playing time and image complexity.

After one side was finished playing, a disc has to be flipped over in order to continue watching a movie, and some titles fill two or more discs. Many players, especially units built after the mid-1980s, can &quot;flip&quot; discs automatically by rotating the optical pickup to the other side of the disc, but this is accompanied by a pause in the movie during the side change. If the movie is longer than what could be stored on two sides of a single disc, manually swapping to a second disc is necessary at some point during the film. One exception to this rule is the Pioneer LD-W1, which features two disc platters. In addition, perfect still frames and random access to individual still frames is limited only to the more expensive CAV discs, which only had a playing time of approximately 30 minutes per side.

On most televisions, a given DVD player will produce a picture that is visually indistinguishable from other units. Differences in image quality between players only becomes easily apparent on large televisions and substantial leaps in image quality are generally only obtained with expensive, high-end players that allow for post-processing of the MPEG-2 stream during playback. In contrast, LaserDisc playback quality is highly dependent on hardware quality. Major variances in picture quality appear between different makers and models of LD players, even when tested on a low to mid-range television. The obvious benefits of using high quality equipment has helped keep demand for some players high, thus also keeping pricing for those units comparably high. In the 1990s, notable players sold for anywhere from US$200 to well over $1,000, while older and less desirable players could be purchased in working condition for as little as $25.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is LaserDisc quality consistent or inconsistent between player brands? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inconsistency</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is LaserDisc playback quality dependent on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hardware quality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How cheaply could an older LaserDisc player be purchased in the 1990s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$25</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What range of prices were high-end LaserDisc players in the 1990s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$200 to well over $1,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many early LDs were not manufactured properly; sometimes a substandard adhesive was used to sandwich together the two sides of the disc.[citation needed] The adhesive contained impurities that were able to penetrate the lacquer seal layer and chemically attack the metalized reflective aluminium layer, causing it to oxidize and lose its reflective characteristics.

While the format was not widely adopted by North American consumers, it was well received among videophiles due to the superior audio and video quality compared to VHS and Betamax tapes, finding a place in nearly one million American homes by the end of 1990. The format was more popular in Japan than in North America because prices were kept low to ensure adoption, resulting in minimal price differences between VHS tapes and the higher quality LaserDiscs, helping ensure that it quickly became the dominant consumer video format in Japan. Anime collectors in every country the LD format was released, which includes both North America and Japan, also quickly became familiar with this format, and sought the higher video and sound quality of LaserDisc and the availability of numerous titles not available on VHS. LaserDiscs were also popular alternatives to videocassettes among movie enthusiasts in the more affluent regions of South East Asia, such as Singapore, due to their high integration with the Japanese export market and the disc-based media's superior longevity compared to videocassette, especially in the humid conditions endemic to that area of the world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why didn't LaserDiscs become popular in North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high cost of the players and discs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By 1990, how many American homes were estimated to use LD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nearly one million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were LaserDiscs more popular in Japan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prices were kept low to ensure adoption</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which format was more popular in high humidity areas such as Singapore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">LaserDiscs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The format also became quite popular in Hong Kong during the 1990s before the introduction of VCDs and DVD; although people rarely bought the discs (because each LD was priced around USD100), high rental activity helped the video rental business in the city grow larger than it had ever been previously. Due to integration with the Japanese export market, NTSC LaserDiscs were used in the Hong Kong market, in contrast to the PAL standard used for broadcast (This anomaly also exists for DVD). This created a market for multi-system TVs and multi-system VCRs which could display or play both PAL and NTSC materials in addition to SECAM materials (which were never popular in Hong Kong).

Instead of printing dailies out on film, processed negatives from the day's shoot would be sent to a mastering plant to be assembled from their 10-minute camera elements into 20-minute film segments. These were then mastered onto single-sided blank LaserDiscs, just as a DVD would be burnt at home today, allowing for much easier selection and preparation of an Edit Decision List. In the days before video assist was available in cinematography, this was the only other way a film crew could see their work. The EDL went to the negative cutter who then cut the camera negative accordingly and assembled the finished film. Only 24 EditDroid systems were ever built, even though the ideas and technology are still in use today. Later EditDroid experiments borrowed from hard-drive technology of having multiple discs on the same spindle and added numerous playback heads and numerous electronics to the basic jukebox design so that any point on each of the discs would be accessible within seconds. This eliminated the need for racks and racks of industrial LaserDisc players since EditDroid discs were only single-sided.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many EditDroid systems were ever built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were EditDroid discs single or multi-sided?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">single-sided</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which production company engineered the EditDroid machines in the 1980s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lucasfilm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1986, a SCSI-equipped LaserDisc player attached to a BBC Master computer was used for the BBC Domesday Project. The player was referred as an LV-ROM (LaserVision Read Only Memory) as the discs contained the driving software as well as the video frames. The discs used the CAV format, and encoded data as a binary signal represented by the analog audio recording. These discs could contain in each CAV frame video/audio or video/binary data, but not both. &quot;Data&quot; frames would appear blank when played as video. It was typical for each disc to start with the disc catalog (a few blank frames) then the video introduction before the rest of the data. Because the format (based on the ADFS hard disc format) used a starting sector for each file, the data layout effectively skipped over any video frames. If all 54,000 frames are used for data storage an LV-ROM disc can contain 324 MB of data per side. The Domesday Project systems also included a genlock, allowing video frames, clips and audio to be mixed with graphics originated from the BBC Master; this was used to great effect for displaying high resolution photographs and maps, which could then be zoomed into.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Doomsday project occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1986</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which equipment was used for the Doomsday Project?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a SCSI-equipped LaserDisc player attached to a BBC Master computer </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does LV-ROM stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">LaserVision Read Only Memory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Doomsday Project discs used which formatting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CAV </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Apple's HyperCard scripting language provided Macintosh computer users with a means to design databases of slides, animation, video and sounds from LaserDiscs and then to create interfaces for users to play specific content from the disc through software called LaserStacks.

Terminator 2 was released twice in Squeeze LD, the second release being THX certified and a notable improvement over the first.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which movie was released twice on Squeeze LD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Terminator 2 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What improvement was added to Terminator 2's second Squeeze LD release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">THX certified</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Warner Brothers films were available in 16:9 aspect ratio Squeeze LDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Unforgiven, Grumpy Old Men, The Fugitive, and Free Willy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What films were available for Japanese market Squeeze LDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Basic Instinct, Stargate, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Showgirls, Cutthroat Island, and Cliffhanger</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another form of recordable LaserDisc that is completely playback-compatible with the LaserDisc format (unlike CRVdisc with its caddy enclosure) is the RLV, or Recordable LaserVision disc.

The purplish color of RLVs is very similar to DVD-R and DVD+R discs.
