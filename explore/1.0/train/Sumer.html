It has been suggested by them and others, that the Sumerian language was originally that of the hunter and fisher peoples, who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region, and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture. Reliable historical records begin much later; there are none in Sumer of any kind that have been dated before Enmebaragesi (c. 26th century BC).

Classical Sumer ends with the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 23rd century BC. Following the Gutian period, there is a brief Sumerian Renaissance in the 21st century BC, cut short in the 20th century BC by Semitic Amorite invasions.

Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of Sargon the Great (c. 2270‚Äì2215 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the &quot;Neo-Sumerian Renaissance&quot; that followed it. Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a &quot;Semitic vs. Sumerian&quot; conflict.

During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language.

The Ubaid pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami transitional ware to the pottery of the Samarra period culture (c. 5700 ‚Äì 4900 BC C-14) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli (Oueilli, Oueili) near Larsa, excavated by the French in the 1980s, where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. According to this theory, farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control, enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do some archaeologists speculate Sumerians originally moved from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the north</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had the Sumerians perfected before coming south?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">irrigation agriculture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Samarra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many levels of pre-Ubaid pottery were excavated by the French in the 1980s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the temple-centered social organization of the farming peoples allow them to mobilize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">labor </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Though women were protected by late Sumerian law and were able to achieve a higher status in Sumer than in other contemporary civilizations, the culture was male-dominated.

Although pictures ‚Äî that is, hieroglyphs ‚Äî were first used, cuneiform and then Ideograms (where symbols were made to represent ideas) soon followed.

Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects like statues or bricks are also very common.

This continued to influence the whole Mesopotamian mythos. Thus in the Enuma Elish the creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water; as male Abzu, and female Tiamat. The product of that union, Lahm and Lahmu, &quot;the muddy ones&quot;, were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of Enki, in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly created Anshar and Kishar, the &quot;sky-pivot&quot; or axle, and the &quot;earth pivot&quot;, parents in turn of Anu (the sky) and Ki (the earth).

Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques,[citation needed] such as buttresses, recesses, half columns, and clay nails.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most impressive and famous style of Sumerian buildings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ziggurats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sumerians also built houses from reeds not very different from ones built by inhabitants in Iraq as recently as when?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400 CE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Sumerians build their strong domes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by constructing and linking several arches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What development by the Sumerians allowed them to make use of domes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the arch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the use of advanced materials and techniques on display in Sumer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sumerian temples and palaces</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. The period c. 2700 ‚Äì 2300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Sumerians a complex system of around 4000 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metrology </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From the Sumerian metrology sprang forth the creation of what disciplines? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arithmetic, geometry, and algebra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Sumerians put their multiplication tables?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> on clay tablets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the abacus first seen between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2700 ‚Äì 2300 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the Sumerians the first to do when it came to mathematics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">use a place value numeral system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Commercial credit and agricultural consumer loans were the main types of loans. The trade credit was usually extended by temples in order to finance trade expeditions and was nominated in silver. The interest rate was set at 1/60 a month (one shekel per mina) some time before 2000 BC and it remained at that level for about two thousand years. Rural loans commonly arose as a result of unpaid obligations due to an institution (such as a temple), in this case the arrears were considered to be lent to the debtor. They were denominated in barley or other crops and the interest rate was typically much higher than for commercial loans and could amount to 1/3 to 1/2 of the loan principal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the main types of loans in Sumerian society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Commercial credit and agricultural consumer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How man shekel per mina was the interest rate for loans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was trade credit backed by when extended by temples?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silver</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how long was the interest rate of Sumerian loans consistent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about two thousand years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What typically arose as a result of unpaid obligations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rural loans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Periodically &quot;clean slate&quot; decrees were signed by rulers which cancelled all the rural (but not commercial) debt and allowed bondservants to return to their homes.

The first known ones were made by Enmetena and Urukagina of Lagash in 2400-2350 BC.

It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry. The infantrymen carried spears, wore copper helmets, and carried rectangular shields.

They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state's primary temple.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sumerians used number systems which included what alternating bases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> base 10 and base 6</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of number system was standard in Sumer and Babylonia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sexagesimal </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of formations is it possible Sumerians invented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What systems did the Sumerians develop which remain the first known these types to this day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">legal and administrative </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Sumerian society, who oversaw the operation of the first formal schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a city-state's primary temple</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
