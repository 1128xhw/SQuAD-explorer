In 1959, Richard Ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon. Ernst Terhardt et al. created an algorithm describing auditory masking with high accuracy.

Krasner was the first to publish and to produce hardware for speech (not usable as music bit compression), but the publication of his results as a relatively obscure Lincoln Laboratory Technical Report did not immediately influence the mainstream of psychoacoustic codec development. Manfred Schroeder was already a well-known and revered figure in the worldwide community of acoustical and electrical engineers, but his paper was not much noticed, since it described negative results due to the particular nature of speech and the linear predictive coding (LPC) gain present in speech. Both Krasner and Schroeder built upon the work performed by Eberhard F. Zwicker in the areas of tuning and masking of critical bands, that in turn built on the fundamental research in the area from Bell Labs of Harvey Fletcher and his collaborators. A wide variety of (mostly perceptual) audio compression algorithms were reported in IEEE's refereed Journal on Selected Areas in Communications. That journal reported in February 1988 on a wide range of established, working audio bit compression technologies, some of them using auditory masking as part of their fundamental design, and several showing real-time hardware implementations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was first proposed in 1979?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The psychoacoustic masking codec</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country were the researchers located in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first to produce hardware for speech?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Krasner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does LPC stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">linear predictive coding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was reported in IEEE's Journal on Selected Areas in Communications?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">audio compression algorithms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The immediate predecessors of MP3 were &quot;Optimum Coding in the Frequency Domain&quot; (OCF), and Perceptual Transform Coding (PXFM).

The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined in MPEG-1 Audio. This reduction in sampling rate serves to cut the available frequency fidelity in half while likewise cutting the bitrate by 50%. MPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced MPEG-1's audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Further work on MPEG was finalized as a part of which MPEG standard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second suite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the official name of ISO/IEC 13818-3 better known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MPEG-2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what rate were the new sampling rates defined in comparison to MPEG-1 Audio?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">half</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Apart from cutting the frequency fidelity in half, what else was cut in half?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bitrate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels was a major aspect of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MPEG-2 Part 3</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An additional extension to MPEG-2 is named MPEG-2.5 audio, as MPEG-3 already had a different meaning.

It thus widens the scope of MP3 to include human speech and other applications requiring only 25% of the frequency reproduction possible with MPEG-1. While not an ISO recognized standard, MPEG-2.5 is widely supported by both inexpensive and brand name digital audio players as well as computer software based MP3 encoders and decoders. A sample rate comparison between MPEG-1, 2 and 2.5 is given further down. MPEG-2.5 was not developed by MPEG and was never approved as an international standard.

Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster. However, it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as Variable Bit Rate (VBR) files. The idea behind this is that, in any piece of audio, some parts will be much easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few instruments, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly. Users who know a particular &quot;quality setting&quot; that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bit rates does the simplest type of MP3 file use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does CBR stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constant Bit Rate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does VBR stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Variable Bit Rate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aside from silence, which sections of music highlight parts that are easier to compress?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">music containing only a few instruments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What value do users need to know when encoding their music to help avoid them having to do tests on each piece of music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quality setting</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Perceived quality can be influenced by listening environment (ambient noise), listener attention, and listener training and in most cases by listener audio equipment (such as sound cards, speakers and headphones).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A listening environment is also know by which term?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ambient noise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than speakers and headphones, what other piece of equipment affects the listener's perceived quality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sound card</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Listening environment, listener attention, listener training and listener audio equipment can all affect what kind of quality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Perceived quality</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A test given to new students by Stanford University Music Professor Jonathan Berger showed that student preference for MP3-quality music has risen each year.
