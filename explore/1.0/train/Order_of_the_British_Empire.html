Honorary appointees who later become a citizen of a Commonwealth realm can convert their appointment from honorary to substantive, then enjoy all privileges of membership of the order including use of the title of Sir and Dame for the senior two ranks of the Order. An example is Irish broadcaster Terry Wogan, who was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order in 2005 and on successful application for dual British and Irish citizenship was made a substantive member and subsequently styled as &quot;Sir Terry Wogan KBE&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are appointed to citizens of nations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Honorary knighthoods </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Queen Elizabeth ll not Head of State?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">citizens of nations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is honorary appointees are incorrectly referred to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir or Dame</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are examples of Sir of Dame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bill Gates or Bob Geldof</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of irish broadcaster?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Terry Wogan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Order has six officials: the Prelate; the Dean; the Secretary; the Registrar; the King of Arms; and the Usher.
