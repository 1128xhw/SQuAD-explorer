On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Russian Parliament, therefore Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was the Declaration of State Sovereignty adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 12, 1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became president on June 12, 1991?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boris Yeltsin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date were the Belavezha Accords signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 8, 1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Russian Parliament ratify the Belavezha Accords?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 12</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agreement did the Belavezha Accords supersede?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation.

The document, consisting of a preamble and fourteen articles, stated that the Soviet Union ceased to exist as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality. However, based on the historical community of peoples, relations between them, given the bilateral treaties, the desire for a democratic rule of law, the intention to develop their relations based on mutual recognition and respect for state sovereignty, the parties agreed to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR by an overwhelming majority: 188 votes for, 6 against, 7 abstentions. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and recalled all Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The legality of this act is the subject of discussions because, according to the 1978 Constitution (Basic Law) of the Russian SFSR, the Russian Supreme Soviet had no right to do so. However, by this time the Soviet government had been rendered more or less impotent, and was in no position to object. Although the December 12 vote is sometimes reckoned as the moment that the RSFSR seceded from the collapsing Soviet Union, this is not the case. It appears that the RSFSR took the line that it was not possible to secede from an entity that no longer existed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country is Viskuli located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Belarus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was the Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 8, 1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for the Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Belavezha Accords</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What body ratified the Belavezha Accords on December 12?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Belavezha Accords consisted of how many articles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fourteen </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On December 24, Yeltsin informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that by agreement of the member states of the CIS Russian Federation would assume the membership of the Soviet Union in all UN organs (including permanent membership in the UN Security Council). Thus, Russia is considered to be an original member of the UN (since October 24, 1945) along with Ukraine (Ukrainian SSR) and Belarus (Byelorussian SSR). On December 25—just hours after Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union—the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation (Russia), reflecting that it was now a sovereign state with Yeltsin assuming the Presidency. The change was originally published on January 6, 1992 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta). According to law, during 1992, it was allowed to use the old name of the RSFSR for official business (forms, seals and stamps). The Russian Federation's Constitution (Fundamental Law) of 1978, though with the 1991–1992 Amendements, remained in effect until the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Russian Federation assume the Soviet Union's membership in the UN?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 24</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what day did Gorbachev give up the presidency of the Soviet Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 25</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the new name given to the Russian SFSR after the resignation of Gorbachev?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Russian Federation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first president of the Russian Federation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yeltsin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what periodical was the new sovereign status of the Russian Federation first published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rossiyskaya Gazeta</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Government was known officially as the Council of People's Commissars (1917–1946), Council of Ministers (1946–1978) and Council of Ministers–Government (1978–1991).
