Leon Battista Alberti, who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, De Re Aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially; and was based on universal, recognisable truths. The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century, with the writing of Vasari: by the 18th century, his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish and English.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the styles of arts created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vasari</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By the 18th century which languages was Vasaris book translated in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italian, French, Spanish and English</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Vitruvius's mind, whose responsibility was it to see the principles carried out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">architect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote De Re Aedificatoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leon Battista Alberti</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Leon Battista Alberti consider most important for beauty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">proportion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ideal proportion did Alberti promote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Golden mean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did &quot;style&quot; as an artistic concept arise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16th </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early 19th century, Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin wrote Contrasts (1836) that, as the titled suggested, contrasted the modern, industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of neo-medieval world.

The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of movement was modern architecture in the beginning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">avant-garde movement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the new movement meant to suit the needs of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the middle and working classes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose needs were no longer relevant to the new style?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the rapidly declining aristocratic order</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of details did the Modernists' want in their buildings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">functionalist </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What details did Modernists' do away with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">historical references and ornament</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright developed Organic architecture, in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being Robie House and Fallingwater.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was instrumental in creating Organic architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Lloyd Wright</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two of Wright's designs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robie House and Fallingwater</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Wright's intention regarding humans and nature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to promote harmony</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures.

Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles. Robert Venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a &quot;decorated shed&quot; (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside), and upheld it against modernist and brutalist &quot;ducks&quot; (buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the start of the  architectural phenomenology movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the late 1950s and 1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was  architectural phenomenology reacting to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modernism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the architectural phenomenologists hoping to expand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">human experience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who called postmodern architecture a &quot;decorated shed&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Venturi </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term did Venturi use for brutalist and mondernist buildings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;ducks&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect [Notes 1] from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.[Notes 2] The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About when did architecture begin specializing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Since the 1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who can no longer design a large structure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one person </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two architectural movements have come under criticism for their focus on individuality? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Modernism and Postmodernism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with profound effect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in Passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques. The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What issue has moved to the forefront in recent years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Environmental sustainability </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do architecture schools look at more and more nowadays?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the environment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first to design architecture environmentally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Lloyd Wright</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was known for focusing on the environment in the 1960s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buckminster Fuller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization's rating system promotes sustainability?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The U.S. Green Building Council</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Concurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism, Metaphoric architecture and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design.
