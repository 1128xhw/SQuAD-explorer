The original meaning of piracy is &quot;robbery or illegal violence at sea&quot;, but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement. Theft, meanwhile, emphasizes the potential commercial harm of infringement to copyright holders. However, copyright is a type of intellectual property, an area of law distinct from that which covers robbery or theft, offenses related only to tangible property. Not all copyright infringement results in commercial loss, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that infringement does not easily equate with theft.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What terms are often linked to people who illegally use or distribute content that is not their own?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> piracy and theft</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What means the same as robbery or illegal violence at sea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">piracy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of property is copyright used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">intellectual property</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the difference between robbery and piracy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> related only to tangible property</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 1980's, the Supreme Court ruled that infringement does not equal what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> theft</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The practice of labelling the infringement of exclusive rights in creative works as &quot;piracy&quot; predates statutory copyright law. Prior to the Statute of Anne in 1710, the Stationers' Company of London in 1557, received a Royal Charter giving the company a monopoly on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter. Those who violated the charter were labelled pirates as early as 1603. The term &quot;piracy&quot; has been used to refer to the unauthorized copying, distribution and selling of works in copyright. Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term &quot;piracy&quot; in relation to copyright infringement, stating &quot;Pirated works may be seized on importation into those countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal protection.&quot; Article 61 of the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires criminal procedures and penalties in cases of &quot;willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale.&quot; Piracy traditionally refers to acts of copyright infringement intentionally committed for financial gain, though more recently, copyright holders have described online copyright infringement, particularly in relation to peer-to-peer file sharing networks, as &quot;piracy.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Royal Charter give to the Stationers' Company of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monopoly on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works use the term piracy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in relation to copyright infringement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would happen if you imported a copyrighted work into a country where the original is protected by copyright law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seized on importation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights enacted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1994</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Piracy has been more recently described online in relation to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peer-to-peer file sharing networks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Copyright holders frequently refer to copyright infringement as theft. In copyright law, infringement does not refer to theft of physical objects that take away the owner's possession, but an instance where a person exercises one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without authorization. Courts have distinguished between copyright infringement and theft. For instance, the United States Supreme Court held in Dowling v. United States (1985) that bootleg phonorecords did not constitute stolen property. Instead, &quot;interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud. The Copyright Act even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright: '[...] an infringer of the copyright.'&quot; The court said that in the case of copyright infringement, the province guaranteed to the copyright holder by copyright law – certain exclusive rights – is invaded, but no control, physical or otherwise, is taken over the copyright, nor is the copyright holder wholly deprived of using the copyrighted work or exercising the exclusive rights held.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When you are accused theft as it relates to copyright law, you are exercising exclusive rights without what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">authorization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have courts said there is a difference between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">copyright infringement and theft</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Dowling v.
