Moreover, different deterrence strategies are required to deter various adversaries, whether they are a nation state, or non-state/transnational actor.

If a crisis occurs, rapid generation and, if necessary, deployment of nuclear strike capabilities will demonstrate US resolve and may prompt an adversary to alter the course of action deemed threatening to our national interest. Should deterrence fail, the President may authorize a precise, tailored response to terminate the conflict at the lowest possible level and lead to a rapid cessation of hostilities. Post-conflict, regeneration of a credible nuclear deterrent capability will deter further aggression. The Air Force may present a credible force posture in either the Continental United States, within a theater of operations, or both to effectively deter the range of potential adversaries envisioned in the 21st century. This requires the ability to engage targets globally using a variety of methods; therefore, the Air Force should possess the ability to induct, train, assign, educate and exercise individuals and units to rapidly and effectively execute missions that support US NDO objectives. Finally, the Air Force regularly exercises and evaluates all aspects of nuclear operations to ensure high levels of performance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the definition of a nuclear strike? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ability of nuclear forces to rapidly and accurately strike targets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What action by the US Air Force would deter adversaries from threatening US Security? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deployment of nuclear strike capabilities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who has the authorization in the US to terminate a conflict?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization does the US Air Force support on its missions? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US NDO objectives</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the areas where the US Air Force might operate its missions? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Continental United States</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nuclear surety ensures the safety, security and effectiveness of nuclear operations. Because of their political and military importance, destructive power, and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act, nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems require special consideration and protection against risks and threats inherent in their peacetime and wartime environments. The Air Force, in conjunction with other entities within the Departments of Defense or Energy, achieves a high standard of protection through a stringent nuclear surety program. This program applies to materiel, personnel, and procedures that contribute to the safety, security, and control of nuclear weapons, thus assuring no nuclear accidents, incidents, loss, or unauthorized or accidental use (a Broken Arrow incident). The Air Force continues to pursue safe, secure and effective nuclear weapons consistent with operational requirements. Adversaries, allies, and the American people must be highly confident of the Air Force's ability to secure nuclear weapons from accidents, theft, loss, and accidental or unauthorized use. This day-to-day commitment to precise and reliable nuclear operations is the cornerstone of the credibility of the NDO mission. Positive nuclear command, control, communications; effective nuclear weapons security; and robust combat support are essential to the overall NDO function.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ensures the safety of nuclear operations? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nuclear surety</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the mission of the NDO in regards to nuclear security? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">precise and reliable nuclear operations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a Broken Arrow incident in nuclear security? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unauthorized or accidental use</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the five functions of NDO support? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">effective nuclear weapons security</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other US departments does the Air Force coordinate with for nuclear security? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Departments of Defense or Energy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Offensive Counterair (OCA) is defined as &quot;offensive operations to destroy, disrupt, or neutralize enemy aircraft, missiles, launch platforms, and their supporting structures and systems both before and after launch, but as close to their source as possible&quot; (JP 1-02).

Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.
