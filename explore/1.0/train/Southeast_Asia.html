Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too.

Soon, Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade, and other rulers followed suit.

Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis.[citation needed] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 15th century, the ruler of which port embraced Islam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Malacca Sultanate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the traders from Yemen settle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which missionary helped to spread Islam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Sufi missionaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which religion proved a positive force among the ruling &amp; trading classes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islam </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During World War II, Imperial Japan invaded most of the former western colonies.

Predictions have been made that more than 40% of the animal and plant species in Southeast Asia could be wiped out in the 21st century. At the same time, haze has been a regular occurrence. The two worst regional hazes were in 1997 and 2006 in which multiple countries were covered with thick haze, mostly caused by &quot;slash and burn&quot; activities in Sumatra and Borneo. In reaction, several countries in Southeast Asia signed the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution to combat haze pollution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of plant and animal species extinction is predicted in the 21st century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 40%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where has haze been predominant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sumatra and Borneo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is a haze formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">caused by &quot;slash and burn&quot; activities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agreement has the Southeast Asian countries signed to combat haze pollution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Transboundary Haze Pollution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the 2 worst haze pollution occur in Southeast Asia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997 and 2006</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Even prior to the penetration of European interests, Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First Spaniards (Manila galleon) and Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into Indonesia, the British into Malaya and parts of Borneo, the French into Indochina, and the Spanish and the US into the Philippines.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name some important commodities that originated in Southeast asian region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the spice trade initially?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian and Arab merchants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which European traders moved into Indonesia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dutch </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The overseas Chinese community has played a large role in the development of the economies in the region.
