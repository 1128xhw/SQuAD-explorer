Following the public school tradition, Eton is a full boarding school, which means all pupils live at the school, and it is one of four such remaining single-sex boys' public schools in the United Kingdom (the others being Harrow, Radley, and Winchester) to continue this practice. Eton has educated 19 British prime ministers and generations of the aristocracy and has been referred to as the chief nurse of England's statesmen. Charging up to £11,478 per term (there are three terms per academic year) in 2014/15, Eton is the sixth most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many public schools are regulated by the 1868 Public Schools Act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ten</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of school requires students to live at the school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">boarding school</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many all-male boarding schools exist in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much does Eton College charge per term?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up to £11,478</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Eton College rate expense-wise with the other HMC boarding schools in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sixth most expensive</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Eton has a long list of distinguished former pupils. David Cameron is the 19th British prime minister to have attended the school, and has recommended that Eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards. Eton now co-sponsors a state sixth-form college in Newham, a deprived area of East London, called the London Academy of Excellence, opened in 2012, which is free of charge and aims to get all its students into higher education. In September 2014, Eton opened, and became the sole educational sponsor for, a new purpose-built co-educational state boarding and day school for around 500 pupils, Holyport College, in Maidenhead in Berkshire, with construction costing around £15 million, in which a fifth of places for day pupils will be set aside for children from poor homes, 21 boarding places will go to youngsters on the verge of being taken into care, and a further 28 boarders will be funded or part-funded through bursaries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many British prime ministers attended Eton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which college in Newham does Eton College co-sponsor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> London Academy of Excellence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does London Academy of Excellence vary in cost from Eton College?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">free of charge </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where will Holyport College be located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maidenhead in Berkshire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much is construction of Holyport College predicted to cost?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">around £15 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships. The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received &quot;significant&quot; financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase. These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August). Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling. The Brent-Eton Summer School, started in 1994, offers 40-50 young people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level. In 2008, Eton helped found the Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School Partnership (ISSP), with six local state schools. The ISSP's aims are &quot;to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools&quot;. Eton also runs a number of choral and English language courses during the summer months.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many students receive financial aid at Eton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many students attended Eton free of charge in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">63</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the goals of the Independent and State School Partnership?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some courses Eton offers in the summer months?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">choral and English language courses</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the run-up to the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games and London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games, Eton's purpose-built Dorney Lake, a permanent, eight-lane, 2,200 metre course (about 1.4 miles) in a 400-acre park, officially known throughout the Games as Eton Dorney, provided training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic competitors, and during the Games, hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Rowing competitions as well as the Olympic Canoe Sprint event, attracting over 400,000 visitors during the Games period (around 30,000 per day), and voted the best 2012 Olympic venue by spectators.

The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s.

Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an excepted charity, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK. As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the School about £1,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the School. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as &quot;assisted places&quot;) to independent schools. However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the School has always been lower. Eton's retiring Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status. The fee for the academic year 2010–2011 was £29,862 (approximately US$48,600 or €35,100 as of March 2011), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is being a charity beneficial to Eton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">substantial tax breaks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What service does Eton provide to the local community free of charge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">use of its facilities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the full price of Eton per student in 2010-2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£29,862 (approximately US$48,600 or €35,100</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did estimated tax breaks save per student in 1992?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£1,945 per pupil per year</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1995 the National Lottery granted money for a £4.6m sports complex, to add to Eton's existing facilities of two swimming pools, 30 cricket squares, 24 football, rugby and hockey pitches and a gym. The College paid £200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only. The UK Sports Council defended the deal on the grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was &quot;deprived&quot; because local people (who were not pupils at the College) did not have a world-class running track and facilities to train with. Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as &quot;staggering&quot; given the background of a substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country, a matter over which, however, neither the College nor the UK Sports Council, had any control. The facility, which became the Thames Valley Athletics Centre, opened in April 1999.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who granted money to Eton for a sports complex in 1995?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the National Lottery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Thames Valley Athletics Centre open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 1999</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what did the college pay a substancial sum and donate 4.5 hectres of land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many cricket squares does Eton have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many swimming pools are located within Eton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> two</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In October 2004, Sarah Forsyth claimed that she had been dismissed unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff.

Following the investigation by the OFT, each school was required to pay around £70,000, totalling around £3.5 million, significantly less than the maximum possible fine. In addition, the schools together agreed to contribute another £3m to a new charitable educational fund. The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked. However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who defended fifty schools accused of price-sharing, stating they were unaware the laws had changed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jean Scott</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was a group of independent schools found guilty of price-sharing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did each school have to pay as punishment for price-sharing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£70,000, totalling around £3.5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the schools elect to contribute money towards, in light of their allegations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a new charitable educational fund</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A Freedom of Information request in 2005 revealed that Eton had received £2,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy.
