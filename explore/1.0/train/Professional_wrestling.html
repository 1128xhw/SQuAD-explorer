Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it portrays a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism.

While it has greatly declined in Europe, in North America it has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and a half of existence.

Revenue is drawn from live event ticket sales, network television broadcasts, pay-per-view broadcasts, personal appearances by performers, branded merchandise and home video. Particularly since the 1950s, pro wrestling events have frequently been responsible for sellout crowds at large arenas, including Madison Square Garden, as well as football stadiums, by promotions including the WWE, the NWA territory system, WCW, and AWA. Pro wrestling was also instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery. Annual shows such as WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, and formerly Bash at the Beach, Halloween Havoc and Starrcade are among the highest-selling pay-per-view programming each year. In modern day, internet programming has been utilized by a number of companies to air web shows, internet pay-per-views (iPPVs) or on-demand content, helping to generate internet-related revenue earnings from the evolving World Wide Web.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the money made from wrestling come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">live event ticket sales, network television broadcasts, pay-per-view broadcasts, personal appearances by performers, branded merchandise and home video</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where large places are some of the major wrestling shows held at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madison Square Garden, as well as football stadiums</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has the internet been utilized for in wrestling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> to air web shows, internet pay-per-views (iPPVs) or on-demand content</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what wrestling shows occur yearly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, and formerly Bash at the Beach, Halloween Havoc and Starrcade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which decade did wrestling start becoming very popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Particularly since the 1950s, pro wrestling events have frequently been responsible for sellout crowds at large arenas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Due to its persistent cultural presence and to its novelty within the performing arts, wrestling constitutes a recurring topic in both academia and the media.

Despite the public admission of the theatrical nature of professional wrestling, many U.S. states still regulate professional wrestling as they do other professional competitive sports.

However, there is a much more limited concept of a fourth wall than in most theatric performances. The audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as spectators to the sporting event being portrayed, and are encouraged to interact as such. This leads to a high level of audience participation; in fact, their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds. Often, individual matches will be part of a longer storyline conflict between &quot;babyfaces&quot; (often shortened to just &quot;faces&quot;) and &quot;heels&quot;. &quot;Faces&quot; (the &quot;good guys&quot;) are those whose actions are intended to encourage the audience to cheer, while &quot;heels&quot; (the &quot;bad guys&quot;) act to draw the spectators' ire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do the wrestlers treat the audience?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as spectators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the audience being acknowledged by the wrestlers impact the show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">This leads to a high level of audience participation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can the audience do during a show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of conflict can arise during a show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Often, individual matches will be part of a longer storyline conflict between &quot;babyfaces&quot; (often shortened to just &quot;faces&quot;) and &quot;heels&quot;.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of the wrestlers are the bad guys?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;heels&quot; (the &quot;bad guys&quot;)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls, with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls, submissions, or countouts being the winner. Historically, matches were wrestled to 3 falls (&quot;best 2 out of 3&quot;) or 5 falls (&quot;best 3 out of 5&quot;). The standard for modern matches is one fall. However, even though it is now standard, many announcers will explicitly state this (e.g. &quot;The following contest is set for one fall with a 20-minute time limit&quot;). These matches are given a time limit; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit, the match is declared a draw. Modern matches are generally given a 10- to 30-minute time limit for standard matches; title matches can go for up to one hour. British wrestling matches held under Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules are 2 out of 3 falls.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wins in a wrestling match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls, submissions, or countouts being the winner. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How could a wrestler win in the past?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Historically, matches were wrestled to 3 falls (&quot;best 2 out of 3&quot;) or 5 falls (&quot;best 3 out of 5&quot;).</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can a wrestler win in modern times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The standard for modern matches is one fall. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what instance will a match be declared a draw?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit, the match is declared a draw. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long can a title match be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">title matches can go for up to one hour</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In matches with multiple competitors, an elimination system may be used. Any wrestler who has a fall scored against them is forced out of the match, and the match continues until only one remains. However, it is much more common when more than two wrestlers are involved to simply go one fall, with the one scoring the fall, regardless of who they scored it against, being the winner. In championship matches, this means that, unlike one-on-one matches (where the champion can simply disqualify themselves or get themselves counted out to retain the title via the &quot;champion's advantag&quot;), the champion does not have to be pinned or involved in the decision to lose the championship. However, heel champions often find advantages, not in champion's advantage, but in the use of weapons and outside interference, as these poly-sided matches tend to involve no holds barred rules.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens when a wrestler has a fall against them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">is forced out of the match</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of rules does a poly-sided match usually have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no holds barred rules</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What usually happens when two or more wrestlers are involved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> to simply go one fall, with the one scoring the fall, regardless of who they scored it against, being the winner.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can a champion lose a championship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">does not have to be pinned or involved in the decision to lose the championship.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include – but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is the WWE's Royal Rumble where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers follow in 90 second intervals (previously 2 minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring. All other rules stay the same.

Although their actions are also frequently scripted for dramatic effect, referees are subject to certain general rules and requirements in order to maintain the theatrical appearance of unbiased authority. The most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall or disqualification. This allows for heel characters to gain a scripted advantage by distracting or disabling the referee in order to perform some ostensibly illegal maneuver on their opponent.

Wrestlers are generally expected to stay within the confines of the ring, though matches sometimes end up outside the ring, and even in the audience, to add excitement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material is within a wrestling ring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an elevated square canvas mat with posts on each corner.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is around the ring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Three horizontal ropes or cables surround the ring,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used for protection in the ring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">For safety, the ropes are padded at the turnbuckles and cushioned mats surround the floor outside the ring.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In some team matches, only one entrant from each team may be designated as the &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;active&quot; wrestler at any given moment.

Instead, they use these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes (the bottom one is the most common, as it is nearest the wrestlers, though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as Chris Masters' Master Lock) or drape their foot across, or underneath one. Once this has been accomplished, and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee, the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold, and start counting to five if the wrestler does not.

If all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time, the referee will begin a count (usually ten seconds, twenty in Japan). If nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count, the match is ruled a draw. Any participant who stands up in time will end the count for everyone else.

In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term &quot;ref bump&quot;. While the referee remains &quot;unconscious&quot;, wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin their opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick-out on their own accord).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the usual reasons for an automatic disqualification? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must the referee do to rule the match at an end via disqualification?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">must see the violation with their own eyes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what case can a referee's decision be overturned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dusty finishes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when a ref is knocked out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ref bump</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can wrestlers do when a ref is out? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">free to violate rules </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A professional wrestling match can end in a draw.

The latter can occur if, for example, one opponent's shoulders touch the mat while maintaining a submission hold against another opponent. If the opponent in the hold begins to tap out at the same time a referee counts to three for pinning the opponent delivering the hold, both opponents have legally achieved scoring conditions simultaneously.

All of these contribute to the profit of the promotion company.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the point of a match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to excite and entertain the audience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Higher attendance and more ticket sales can be the result of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heightened interest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Though the contest is staged, what can garner more interest from the crowd? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dramatic emphasis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Latin America and English-speaking countries, most wrestlers (and other on-stage performers) portray character roles, sometimes with personalities wildly different from their own. These personalities are a gimmick intended to heighten interest in a wrestler without regard to athletic ability. Some can be unrealistic and cartoon-like (such as Doink the Clown), while others carry more verisimilitude and can be seen as exaggerated versions of the performer's real life personality (such as Chris Jericho, The Rock, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and CM Punk).

Others can keep one ring name for their entire career (cases in point include Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, CM Punk and Ricky Steamboat), or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company. Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company, forcing the wrestler to find a new one when they leave (although a simple typeset change, such as changing Rhyno to Rhino, can usually get around this), and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler. Sometimes, a wrestler may change their legal name in order to obtain ownership of their ring name (examples include Andrew Martin and Warrior). Many wrestlers (such as The Rock and The Undertaker) are strongly identified with their character, even responding to the name in public or between friends. It's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names, unless otherwise introduced. A professional wrestling character's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media (see Hulk Hogan and El Santo) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter politics (Antonio Inoki and Jesse Ventura, among others).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the popular way for wrestlers to refer to one another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> by their stage names/characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than a company, who else can own a character?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the wrestler</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can a wrestler get around changing their ring name entirely?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">typeset change</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else might a wrestler do to obtain their ring name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">change their legal name</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Typically, matches are staged between a protagonist (historically an audience favorite, known as a babyface, or &quot;the good guy&quot;) and an antagonist (historically a villain with arrogance, a tendency to break rules, or other unlikable qualities, called a heel). In recent years, however, antiheroes have also become prominent in professional wrestling. There is also a less common role of a &quot;tweener&quot;, who is neither fully face nor fully heel yet able to play either role effectively (case in point, Samoa Joe during his first run in TNA from June 2005 to November 2006).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are other names for a protagonist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">babyface, or &quot;the good guy&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What will an antagonist usually do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">break rules</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a wrestler whose persona is somewhere between the two norms called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tweener</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is generally the audience favorite? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">protagonist</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At times a character may &quot;turn&quot;, altering their face/heel alignment.

Some turns become defining points in a wrestler's career, as was the case when Hulk Hogan turned heel after being a top face for over a decade. Others may have no noticeable effect on the character's status. If a character repeatedly switches between being a face and heel, this lessens the effect of such turns, and may result in apathy from the audience.

Sometimes a character's heel turn will become so popular that eventually the audience response will alter the character's heel-face cycle to the point where the heel persona will, in practice, become a face persona, and what was previously the face persona, will turn into the heel persona, such as when Dwayne Johnson first began using &quot;The Rock&quot; persona as a heel character, as opposed to his original &quot;Rocky Maivia&quot; babyface persona. Another legendary example is Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was originally booked as a heel, with such mannerisms as drinking on the job, using profanity, breaking company property, and even breaking into people's private homes. However, much to WWF's surprise, the fans enjoyed Austin's antics so much that he became one of the greatest antiheroes in the history of the business.

Managers have sometimes become major personalities, including Bobby Heenan, Paul Heyman, Ernie Roth, and Paul Bearer. A manager role may also be filled by a &quot;valet&quot;, typically an appealing female who may participate in love triangle storylines, &quot;damsel in distress&quot; situations, and scripted fights with female wrestlers.

Hornswoggle has also been given a run with the Cruiserweight Championship and feuded with D-Generation X in 2009.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A wrestler may have a small person called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mini me</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else can a little person do in the match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">become valets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Dave Finlay often helped by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hornswoggle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else did Finlay do with his little person?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">occasionally threw him at his opponent(s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Hornswoggle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">given a run with the Cruiserweight Championship</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Though they have not had the level of exposure as other wrestlers, bears have long been a part of professional wrestling. Usually declawed and muzzled, they often wrestled shoot matches against audience members, offered a cash reward if they could pin the bear. They also wrestled professionals in worked, often battle royal or handicap, matches (usually booked so the bear won). Though they have wrestled around the world and continue to do so, wrestling bears enjoyed their greatest popularity in the Southern United States, during the 1960s and 1970s. The practice of bear wrestling has met strong opposition from animal rights activists in recent decades, contributing to its lack of mainstream acceptance. As of 2006, it is banned in 20 U.S. states.

It is a &quot;triumph&quot; if the face wins, while it is a &quot;tragedy&quot; if the heel wins.

Wrestlers in Mexico are traditionally more agile and perform more aerial maneuvers than professional wrestlers in the U.S. who, more often, rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents. The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the cruiserweight division (peso semicompleto) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. Wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the wrestling ring's ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds. Lucha libre is also known for its tag team wrestling matches, in which the teams are often made up of three members, instead of two as is common in the U.S.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do characters differ in Mexican wrestling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they are less emphasized</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are Mexican wrestlers different? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> more agile and perform more aerial maneuvers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do American wrestlers depend on? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else is lucha libre known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> tag team wrestling matches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does lucha libre's tag team matches differ? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">often made up of three members, instead of two as is common in the U.S</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The style of Japanese professional wrestling (puroresu) is again different.

Despite the similarity to its American counterpart in that the outcome of the matches remains predetermined, the phenomena are different in the form of the psychology and presentation of the sport; it is treated as a full contact combat sport as it mixes hard hitting martial arts strikes with shoot style submission holds, while in the U.S. it is rather more regarded as an entertainment show. Wrestlers incorporate kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis is placed on submission wrestling, and unlike the use of involved storylines in the U.S., they are not as intricate in Japan, more emphasis is placed on the concept of Fighting Spirit, meaning the Wrestlers display of physical and mental stamina are valued a lot more than theatrics. Many of Japan's wrestlers including top stars such as Shinya Hashimoto, Riki Choshu and Keiji Mutoh came from a legitimate martial arts background and many Japanese wrestlers in the 1990s began to pursue careers in mixed martial arts organizations such as Pancrase and Shooto which at the time retained the original look of puroresu, but were actual competitions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is Japanese wrestling similar to American?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">outcome of the matches remains predetermined</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Japanese wrestling differ? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the form of the psychology and presentation of the sport</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Japanese wrestling combine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hard hitting martial arts strikes with shoot style submission holds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the emphasis placed on in Japanese wrestling? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fighting Spirit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a common background for a Japanese wrestler? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">legitimate martial arts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Those involved in producing professional wrestling have developed a kind of global fraternity, with familial bonds, shared language and passed-down traditions.

The French theorist Roland Barthes was among the first to propose that wrestling was worthy of deeper analysis, in his essay &quot;The World of Wrestling&quot; from his book Mythologies, first published in 1957. Barthes argued that it should be looked at not as a scamming of the ignorant, but as spectacle; a mode of theatric performance for a willing, if bloodthirsty, audience. Wrestling is described as performed art which demands an immediate reading of the juxtaposed meanings. The logical conclusion is given least importance over the theatrical performers of the wrestlers and the referee. According to Barthes, the function of a wrestler is not to win: it is to go exactly through the motions which are expected of them and to give the audience a theatrical spectacle.
