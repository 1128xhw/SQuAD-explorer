Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term &quot;angiosperm&quot; comes from the Greek composite word (angeion-, &quot;case&quot; or &quot;casing&quot;, and sperma, &quot;seed&quot;) meaning &quot;enclosed seeds&quot;, after the enclosed condition of the seeds.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the most diverse group of land plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">angiosperms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many species of flowering plants are there about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">350,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does an angiosperm produce its seeds within?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an enclosure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do angiosperms have in common with gymnosperms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seed-producing plants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Greek word for &quot;case&quot; or &quot;casing&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">angeion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Fossilized spores suggest that higher plants (embryophytes) have lived on land for at least 475 million years. Early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated, swimming sperm, like the green algae from which they evolved. An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae. A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage, the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed plants. A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in Selaginella, the spike-moss. The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce flowers. The pollen grains (males) of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated, mobile sperm cells that &quot;swim&quot; down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long have higher plants lived on land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at least 475 million years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did early plants reproduce sexually?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with flagellated, swimming sperm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Upright meisporangia allowed what to be dispersed to new habitats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spores </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the nearest algal relatives existing today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charophycean green algae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the common name for Selaginella?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the spike-moss</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an &quot;abominable mystery&quot; by Charles Darwin. However, the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin, and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants, but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. Some older fossils, such as the upper Triassic Sanmiguelia, have been suggested. Based on current evidence, some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms in the Triassic period (245–202 million years ago). Fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the Middle Triassic (247.2–242.0 Ma) suggests an older date for their origin. A close relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes, proposed on the basis of morphological evidence, has more recently been disputed on the basis of molecular evidence that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Charles Darwin call the sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abominable mystery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of fossil is the recently discovered Archaefructus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">angiosperm </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What fossil evidence is lacking when it comes to flowers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what period does fossilized pollen suggest an older date for angiosperm origin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle Triassic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What relationship proposed on the basis of morphological evidence has recently been disputed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The evolution of seed plants and later angiosperms appears to be the result of two distinct rounds of whole genome duplication events.

However, one study has suggested that the early-middle Jurassic plant Schmeissneria, traditionally considered a type of ginkgo, may be the earliest known angiosperm, or at least a close relative. In addition, circumstantial chemical evidence has been found for the existence of angiosperms as early as 250 million years ago. Oleanane, a secondary metabolite produced by many flowering plants, has been found in Permian deposits of that age together with fossils of gigantopterids.

Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general, especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example). Such a relationship, with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant(s) and their partners.

The most popular descriptive name has been Angiospermae (Angiosperms), with Anthophyta (&quot;flowering plants&quot;) a second choice. These names are not linked to any rank. The Wettstein system and the Engler system use the name Angiospermae, at the assigned rank of subdivision. The Reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision Magnoliophytina (Frohne &amp; U. Jensen ex Reveal, Phytologia 79: 70 1996), but later split it to Magnoliopsida, Liliopsida, and Rosopsida. The Takhtajan system and Cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division, leading to the name Magnoliophyta (from the family name Magnoliaceae). The Dahlgren system and Thorne system (1992) treat this group at the rank of class, leading to the name Magnoliopsida. The APG system of 1998, and the later 2003 and 2009 revisions, treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name. However, a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the Subclass Magnoliidae.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In taxonomies, what type of group are flowering plants treated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coherent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does anthophyta mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flowering plants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the Wettstein and Engler systems use at the assigned rank of subdivision?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Angiospermae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the APG system of 1998, with its 2003 and 2009 revisions, treat flowering plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a clade called angiosperms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What formal subclass classification were flowering plants given in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Magnoliidae</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The internal classification of this group has undergone considerable revision.

By the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles (interfascicular cambium), a complete ring is formed, and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. The soft phloem becomes crushed, but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial.

This process begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil (female reproductive structure), germinates, and grows a long pollen tube. While this pollen tube is growing, a haploid generative cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus. The generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid (n) sperm cells. As the pollen tube grows, it makes its way from the stigma, down the style and into the ovary. Here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids, releasing its contents (which include the sperm cells). The synergid that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell, producing a diploid (2n) zygote. The second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei, producing a triploid (3n) cell. As the zygote develops into an embryo, the triploid cell develops into the endosperm, which serves as the embryo's food supply. The ovary now will develop into fruit and the ovule will develop into seed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process does double fertilization refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a pollen grain adhere to, to start the process of double fertilization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the stigma of the pistil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of cell travels down the pollen tube while it's growing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">haploid generative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the pollen tube release its sperm cells?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one of the synergids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What serves as the embryo's food supply?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">endosperm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The character of the seed coat bears a definite relation to that of the fruit.
