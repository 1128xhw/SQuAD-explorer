According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, present-day Nepal sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.[note 1] He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving. Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of religion is Buddhism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nontheistic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the practices of Buddhism based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">teachings attributed to Gautama Buddh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Buddha live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">present-day Nepal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do Buddhists believe their suffering can be ended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Buddha teach should be given up to end suffering?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ignorance and craving</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of religion is Buddhism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nontheistic religion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's teaching is Buddhism based upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gautama Buddha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Buddha alive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Buddha reside when he was alive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">present-day Nepal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's teachings is Buddhism based upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gautama Buddha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Buddha thought to live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nepal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When approximately was Buddha alive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Buddhism is based on the teaching of who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gautama Buddha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many noble truths are there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Buddha was part of what subcontinent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is &quot;the awakened one&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddha</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (&quot;The School of the Elders&quot;) and Mahayana (&quot;The Great Vehicle&quot;).

Mahayana which includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon, and Tiantai (Tendai) is found throughout East Asia. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth century India, is practiced in regions surrounding the Himalayas, Mongolia and Kalmykia.

Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking &quot;refuge in the triple gem&quot; has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Three Jewels of the Buddhist tradition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the Ten Meritorious Deeds of Buddhism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other practices do Buddhists adhere to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ten Meritorious Deeds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the Ten Meritorious Deeds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Buddhism denies what kind of deity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">creator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of the Ten Meritorious Deeds, giving charity reduces what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">greediness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas is in what tradition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mahayana</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This narrative draws on the Nidānakathā of the Jataka tales of the Theravada, which is ascribed to Buddhaghoṣa in the 5th century CE.

These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual quest.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Śuddhodana do to ensure that his son became a king instead of a holy man?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prevented him from leaving the palace grounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Gautama when he first left the palace grounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">29</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened when Gautama left the palace grounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he learned of the suffering of ordinary people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the four sights in Buddhism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">encountering an old man, a sick man, a corpse and, finally, an ascetic holy man</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Buddha's father want him to become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a king</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what age was he venturing outside?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">29</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were his first four encounters called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the four sights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Gautama do after learning about the outside world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abandon royal life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Suddhodana wanted his son to become what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a king</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Gautama venture out from the palace area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">29</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many &quot;sights&quot; did Gautama have that are well known?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Gautama encountered an old man, a sick man, a holy man, and a what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">corpse</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day, and mastered the meditative attainments they taught. But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest. He next attempted an extreme asceticism, which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas, a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one. Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach. He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation, through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way (Skt. madhyamā-pratipad): a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.[web 2][web 3]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first thing Gautama did on his spiritual quest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">went to study with famous religious teachers of the day</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Middle Way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some of the practices Gautama underwent on his quest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first skill Gautama learnt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">meditation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What almost killed Gautama in his pursuit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">asceticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did he receive from the locals that changed his approach?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">milk and rice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the path of moderation called he followed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle Way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Gautama didn't like the religious teaching he initially found because of why?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they did not provide a permanent end to suffering</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Gautama accept from a village girl?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">milk and rice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Gautama devoted himself to what type of meditation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anapanasati</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Buddhists call anapanasati what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Middle Way</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gautama was now determined to complete his spiritual quest. At the age of 35, he famously sat in meditation under a Ficus religiosa tree now called the Bodhi Tree in the town of Bodh Gaya and vowed not to rise before achieving enlightenment. After many days, he finally destroyed the fetters of his mind, thereby liberating himself from the cycle of suffering and rebirth, and arose as a fully enlightened being (Skt. samyaksaṃbuddha). Soon thereafter, he attracted a band of followers and instituted a monastic order. Now, as the Buddha, he spent the rest of his life teaching the path of awakening he had discovered, traveling throughout the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent, and died at the age of 80 (483 BCE) in Kushinagar, India.

Nagarjuna's primary contribution to Buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of śūnyatā, or &quot;emptiness&quot;, widely attested in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras that emerged in his era. The concept of emptiness brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and dependent origination, to refute the metaphysics of Sarvastivada and Sautrantika (extinct non-Mahayana schools). For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of ātman; all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally &quot;own-nature&quot; or &quot;self-nature&quot;), and thus without any underlying essence; they are &quot;empty&quot; of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the Mādhyamaka. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the Canon. In the eyes of Nagarjuna the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Mādhyamaka system.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nagarjuna's main contribution was the exposition of the concept of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">śūnyatā</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does sunyata mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emptiness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nagarjuna said that sentient beings are empty of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ātman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does dharmas mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phenomena</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sarvastivada teachings—which were criticized by Nāgārjuna—were reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asanga and were adapted into the Yogacara school.

There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the Jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sutras&quot; are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature.

These Three Jewels bring a fruition that is changeless, for once one has reached Buddhahood, there is no possibility of falling back to suffering.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the first step in a school of Buddhism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Three Jewels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mentions taking refuge on behalf of young or unborn children?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Majjhima Nikaya</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of Buddhism adds a fourth refuge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tibetan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Three Jewels are preceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">essence.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has an irreversable effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Three Jewels</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to the scriptures, Gautama Buddha presented himself as a model.

According to Routledge's Encyclopedia of Buddhism, in contrast, throughout most of Buddhist history before modern times, serious meditation by lay people has been unusual.

In the Tibetan tradition, these practices can include sexual yoga, though only for some very advanced practitioners.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of Buddhism is Tibeto-Mongolian based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mahayana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the English term for Vajrayana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Diamond Vehicle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of Buddhism is concerned with ritual and meditative practices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tantric</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Psycho-physical energy is harnessed through what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ritual</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of ancient India during the second half of the first millennium BCE.

Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.
