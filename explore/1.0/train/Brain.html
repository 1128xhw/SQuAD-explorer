Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the center of the nervous system in all creatures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The brain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most complex organ in an animal's body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The brain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In people, how many neurons make up the cerebral cortex?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15–33 billion </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Neurons in the brain interact with each other by fibers called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">axons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A few animals without spines that do not have a brain are what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body.

Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations.

Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain. The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Brains of organisms are made up mostly of what two classes of cells?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neurons and glial cells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Glial cells are also referred to as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glia or neuroglia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of the two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells send signals to other cells?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neurons </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Axons send signals that are named what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">action potentials</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the typical speed that axons send their electrical signals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1–100 meters per second</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses.

The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs.

The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them.

All bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the Cambrian period, 485-540 million years ago, and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body. At a schematic level, that basic worm-shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians, including vertebrates. The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain. The brain is small and simple in some species, such as nematode worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is the most complex organ in the body. Some types of worms, such as leeches, also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord, known as a &quot;tail brain&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Creatures that have a diffuse nerve net are called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cnidarians </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bilaterians are animals that have what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">symmetric body shape</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Cambrian period was how long ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">485-540 million years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A nerve cord with an enlargement is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a ganglion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of creature has a ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord as well?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">leeches</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including echinoderms, tunicates, and acoelomorphs (a group of primitive flatworms).

This formula describes the central tendency, but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior.

The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Brain tissue that is living is what color on the outside?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pinkish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The color of the brain inside is what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> white </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Brains are surrounded by what system of tissues?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">meninges</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Meninges separate what structure from the brain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the skull </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The blood-brain barrier is made up of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cells in the blood vessel walls </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Neuroanatomists usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata.

The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata).

These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path.

EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain.

Follow-up studies in higher-order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity, color, movement, and aspects of shape, with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses.

There is substantial evidence that the basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively.

Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What field of science studies the brain and the central nervous system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neuroscience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What scientific field tries to understand the mind and behavior?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Psychology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What field of science strives to diagnose and treat diseases of the nervous system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> neurology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Psychiatry is the branch of science that does what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">study, prevent, and treat mental disorders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Cognitive science seeks to join what two branches of science with other fields?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neuroscience and psychology</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical, and until the middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The oldest known method of studying the brain is what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anatomical,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do neuroanatomists study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the large-scale structure of the brain </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of study uses medical imaging techniques to correlate changes in brain structure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neuroanatomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Until what century was brain studying mostly anatomical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the middle of the 20th century,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do neurophysiologists study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The most common tools that neurophysiologists use are what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> drugs and recording devices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of receptors does the brain lack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pain receptors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Electrodes are often glued to what like in EEG studies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the scalp</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The brain is surrounded by what type of fluid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cerebrospinal fluid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The brain is separated from the bloodstream by what feature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the blood–brain barrier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The two main structures that protect the brain are what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the skull and meninges</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of disease if often studied to understand damage to the brain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strokes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of animal is most commonly used to study brain damage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> rats</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches: first, the use of computers to study the brain; second, the study of how brains perform computation.

On the other hand, it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating, or mathematically analyzing, the operations of simplified &quot;units&quot; that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity.

Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, usually translated as &quot;animal spirits&quot;. Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of René Descartes and those who followed him. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical res cogitans, but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of animals, could be explained mechanistically.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The physician Galen was from which country in history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What period in history was anatomical  studies of nerves greatly increased?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Renaissance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who coined the term pneumata psychikon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Roman physician Galen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Penumata psychikon is usually translated as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">animal spirits</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who found out that a shock of electricity to an exposed nerve of a dead frog caused contractions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Luigi Galvani</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The tool that was invented to stain only a small fractions of neurons was called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Golgi stain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nationality was santiago Ramon y Cajal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spanish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the first half of the 20th century, advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells, culminating in work by Alan Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley, and others on the biophysics of the action potential, and the work of Bernard Katz and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse.
