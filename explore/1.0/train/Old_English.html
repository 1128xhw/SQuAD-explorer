It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid 5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid 7th century. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, English was replaced for a time as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman, a relative of French, and Old English developed into the next historical form of English, known as Middle English.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the English language's earliest form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old English</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what parts of Scotland was Old English spoken?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">southern and eastern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in what historical period was Old English spoken?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the early Middle Ages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What people brought Old English to Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anglo-Saxon settlers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language developed from Old English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle English</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The four main dialectal forms of Old English were Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish, and West Saxon.

It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral Angles and Saxons left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the Latin alphabet was introduced and adapted for the writing of Old English, replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly Old French) words into English occurred after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and thus in the Middle English rather than the Old English period.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what language did Old English borrow some words?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What individuals introduced the Latin alphabet to the speakers of Old English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Irish Christian missionaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the Norman Conquest, Latin words entered English via what language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before the introduction of the Latin alphabet, how was Old English written?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> runic system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Norman Conquest occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1066</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Old English nouns had grammatical gender, a feature absent in modern English, which uses only natural gender.

Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while Scots developed from the Northumbrian dialect.

The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most “important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.” This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in “simplifying English grammar.”</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language influenced Old English as a result of the Viking invasions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Danish </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language was spoken in Northern England after the Viking invasions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old Norse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between the English and Scandinavian language, what elements were most different?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inflectional</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Unlike Modern English, Old English is a language rich in morphological diversity.

Simeon Potter notes: “No less far-reaching was the influence of Scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of English in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south. It was, after all, a salutary influence. The gain was greater than the loss.

It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which became the Kingdom of England. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern Scotland, which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Other parts of the island – Wales and most of Scotland – continued to use Celtic languages, except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where Old Norse was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: Medieval Cornish was spoken all over Cornwall and in adjacent parts of Devon, while Cumbric survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of Cumbria, and Welsh may have been spoken on the English side of the Anglo-Welsh border. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under Danish law.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language family does Old English belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">West Germanic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Ingvaeonic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Sea Germanic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did Old English first develop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Anglo-Saxon kingdom ruled parts of modern-day Scotland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Northumbria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language was spoken in Cornwall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Medieval Cornish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are Beowulf, an epic poem; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a record of early English history; the Franks Casket, an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and Cædmon's Hymn, a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as Bede and Cædmon. Cædmon, the earliest English poet we know by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an important Old English historical record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an important Old English religious poem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cædmon's Hymn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of literary work is Beowulf?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an epic poem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the earliest English poet known by name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cædmon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Cædmon live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Whitby</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Anglo-Frisian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Sea Germanic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language family did Common Brittonic belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Celtic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the Latin language brought to Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman invasion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did Scandinavian settlement begin in northern England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Angles and Saxons, what tribe spoke Anglo-Frisian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jutes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the unification of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (outside the Danelaw) by Alfred the Great in the later 9th century, the language of government and literature became standardised around the West Saxon dialect (Early West Saxon).

Many place-names in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the West Saxon dialect, away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in Middle English texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what century did Cnut rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Cnut's nationality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Danish </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what century did Scandinavians begin to settle in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language was a source for English loanwords that are still used today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old Norse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with eastern England, what part of England contains many place names of Scandinavian origin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">northern </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions.

Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between velar and palatal ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩ by placing dots above the palatals: ⟨ċ⟩, ⟨ġ⟩.
