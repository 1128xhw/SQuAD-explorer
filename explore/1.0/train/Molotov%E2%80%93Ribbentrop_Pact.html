In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German and Soviet &quot;spheres of influence&quot;, anticipating potential &quot;territorial and political rearrangements&quot; of these countries. Thereafter, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. After the Soviet–Japanese ceasefire agreement took effect on 16 September, Stalin ordered his own invasion of Poland on 17 September. Part of southeastern (Karelia) and Salla region in Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertza region). Concern about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been proffered as justification for the Soviet invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence agreed with the Axis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The agreement between the Nazis and the Soviets split what countries up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invaded Poland after the Nazi’s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries were taken over by the Soviets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who broke the agreement with the invasion of Bukovina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stalin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Salla is located in what country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Finland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Of the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1940, the region around Białystok and a minor part of Galicia east of the San river around Przemyśl were returned to the Polish state at the end of World War II.

Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and Trotsky were forced to enter into the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded massive western Russian territories to the German Empire.

Moreover, the anti-Semitic Nazis associated ethnic Jews with both communism and financial capitalism, both of which they opposed. Consequently, Nazi theory held that Slavs in the Soviet Union were being ruled by &quot;Jewish Bolshevik&quot; masters. In 1934, Hitler himself had spoken of an inescapable battle against both Pan-Slavism and Neo-Slavism, the victory in which would lead to &quot;permanent mastery of the world&quot;, though he stated that they would &quot;walk part of the road with the Russians, if that will help us.&quot; The resulting manifestation of German anti-Bolshevism and an increase in Soviet foreign debts caused German–Soviet trade to dramatically decline.[b] Imports of Soviet goods to Germany fell to 223 million Reichsmarks in 1934 as the more isolationist Stalinist regime asserted power and the abandonment of post–World War I Treaty of Versailles military controls decreased Germany's reliance on Soviet imports.[clarification needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was to blame for communism and capitalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ethnic Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What reduced Germany’s need for Soviet goods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treaty of Versailles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which political group created problems between the Soviet and German governments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nazi Party</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hitler's fierce anti-Soviet rhetoric was one of the reasons why the UK and France decided that Soviet participation in the 1938 Munich Conference regarding Czechoslovakia would be both dangerous and useless. The Munich Agreement that followed marked a partial German annexation of Czechoslovakia in late 1938 followed by its complete dissolution in March 1939, which as part of the appeasement of Germany conducted by Chamberlain's and Daladier's cabinets. This policy immediately raised the question of whether the Soviet Union could avoid being next on Hitler's list. The Soviet leadership believed that the West wanted to encourage German aggression in the East and that France and Britain might stay neutral in a war initiated by Germany, hoping that the warring states would wear each other out and put an end to both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What countries prevented the Soviets from joining the Munich Conference?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UK and France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the English politician who appeased Germany with the take over of Czechoslovakia</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chamberlain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The soviets suspected that Nazi-Soviet conflicts would result in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">put an end to both the Soviet Union and Nazi German</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For Germany, because an autarkic economic approach or an alliance with Britain were impossible, closer relations with the Soviet Union to obtain raw materials became necessary, if not just for economic reasons alone. Moreover, an expected British blockade in the event of war would create massive shortages for Germany in a number of key raw materials. After the Munich agreement, the resulting increase in German military supply needs and Soviet demands for military machinery, talks between the two countries occurred from late 1938 to March 1939. The third Soviet Five Year Plan required new infusions of technology and industrial equipment.[clarification needed] German war planners had estimated serious shortfalls of raw materials if Germany entered a war without Soviet supply.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During conflict, what would prevent transport of materials?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British blockade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between german and the soviet union which country needed military machinery? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military machinery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believed they needed a supply line from the Soviet Union to sustain another war? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Soviet Union, which feared Western powers and the possibility of &quot;capitalist encirclements&quot;, had little faith either that war could be avoided, or faith in the Polish army, and wanted nothing less than an ironclad military alliance with France and Britain that would provide a guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany; thus, Stalin's adherence to the collective security line was purely conditional. Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided, and that the Soviet Union, weakened by the Great Purge, could not be a main military participant, a point that many military sources were at variance with, especially Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung army on the Manchurian frontier. France was more anxious to find an agreement with the USSR than was Britain; as a continental power, it was more willing to make concessions, more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany. These contrasting attitudes partly explain why the USSR has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939: carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France while secretly considering propositions from Germany.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Soviet government fear the governments of France and Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capitalist encirclements</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did western power believe that the soviet government wouldn’t partake in another world war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Purge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country was at war with Japan in China prior to World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was afraid of a pact between Germany and the Soviet governments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the end of May, drafts were formally presented. In mid-June, the main Tripartite negotiations started. The discussion was focused on potential guarantees to central and east European countries should a German aggression arise. The USSR proposed to consider that a political turn towards Germany by the Baltic states would constitute an &quot;indirect aggression&quot; towards the Soviet Union. Britain opposed such proposals, because they feared the Soviets' proposed language could justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states, or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany. The discussion about a definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; became one of the sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite political negotiations effectively stalled, while the parties agreed to start negotiations on a military agreement, which the Soviets insisted must be entered into simultaneously with any political agreement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who predicted soviet aggression in the Baltic region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What month did the Tripartite discussions begin between Britain, USSR and France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-June</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country is blamed for the Tripartite discussion to stagnate and fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Soviets</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From April–July, Soviet and German officials made statements regarding the potential for the beginning of political negotiations, while no actual negotiations took place during that time period. The ensuing discussion of a potential political deal between Germany and the Soviet Union had to be channeled into the framework of economic negotiations between the two countries, because close military and diplomatic connections, as was the case before the mid-1930s, had afterward been largely severed. In May, Stalin replaced his Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, who was regarded as pro-western and who was also Jewish, with Vyacheslav Molotov, allowing the Soviet Union more latitude in discussions with more parties, not only with Britain and France.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Soviet Foreign Minister lost his job because of his favorable attitude towards the west?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maxim Litvinov</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two countries positioned themselves to broker a deal returning to a pre-1930’s treaty with each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet and German</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two countries positioned themselves to broker an new trade agreement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany and the Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the same time, British, French, and Soviet negotiators scheduled three-party talks on military matters to occur in Moscow in August 1939, aiming to define what the agreement would specify should be the reaction of the three powers to a German attack.

In the north, Finland, Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.

Lithuania, adjacent to East Prussia, would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed to in September 1939 reassigned the majority of Lithuania to the USSR. According to the secret protocol, Lithuania would be granted the city of Vilnius – its historical capital, which was under Polish control during the inter-war period. Another clause of the treaty was that Germany would not interfere with the Soviet Union's actions towards Bessarabia, then part of Romania; as the result, Bessarabia was joined to the Moldovan ASSR, and become the Moldovan SSR under control of Moscow.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country held the city Vilnius prior to the inter-war period? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lithuania</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country would reclaim the city of Vilnius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lithuania</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rivers would the soviet union claim as their own during the invasion of poland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pisa, Narev, Vistula and San rivers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who would claim Lithuania under their political umbrella?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bessarabia eventually became under the control of which country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 24 August, Pravda and Izvestia carried news of the non-secret portions of the Pact, complete with the now infamous front-page picture of Molotov signing the treaty, with a smiling Stalin looking on.

The move raised tensions with the Soviets, who responded that Germany was supposed to have consulted with the Soviet Union under Article III of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who stopped the trade because of a disagreement involving Romania?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet Union </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What regions were redrawn in effort to improve relations between Germany and the Soviets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hungarian and Romanian borders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who started refining Romanian oil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After Germany entered a Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, Ribbentrop wrote to Stalin, inviting Molotov to Berlin for negotiations aimed to create a 'continental bloc' of Germany, Italy, Japan and the USSR that would oppose Britain and the USA. Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact. After negotiations during November 1940 on where to extend the USSR's sphere of influence, Hitler broke off talks and continued planning for the eventual attempts to invade the Soviet Union.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What countries agreed to a tripartisan agreement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany entered a Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Foreign Minister proposed that the Soviets should join this agreement of axis powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ribbentrop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who would the axis powers oppose in the new agreement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Britain and the USA</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on 13 April 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Axis power Japan. While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union. Stalin did not know that Hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since summer 1940, and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the east regardless of the parties' talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis Power.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was planning an invasion of the Soviet Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hitler</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Soviet Union agree to remain neutral with when they signed a treaty on the 13th of April?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Stalin sign the pact? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reinforce a public affection for Germany</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nazi Germany terminated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact at 03:15 on 22 June 1941 by launching a massive attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland which marked the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union known as Operation Barbarossa. Stalin had ignored several warnings that Germany was likely to invade, and ordered no 'full-scale' mobilization of forces although the mobilization was ongoing. After the launch of the invasion, the territories gained by the Soviet Union as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were lost in a matter of weeks. Within six months, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties, and Germany had captured three million Soviet prisoners. The lucrative export of Soviet raw materials to Nazi Germany over the course of the Nazi–Soviet economic relations (1934–41) continued uninterrupted until the outbreak of hostilities. The Soviet exports in several key areas enabled Germany to maintain its stocks of rubber and grain from the first day of the invasion until October 1941.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the German attack on Soviet forces occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet positions in eastern Poland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Soviet military members died within the first six months of the war between the two countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4.3 million casualties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Soviet prisoners did german take within the first six months of war between the two countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three million Soviet prisoners</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did it take to capture regions of the world that were once occupied by soviets once the initial attack occurred?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">matter of weeks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The German original of the secret protocols was presumably destroyed in the bombing of Germany, but in late 1943, Ribbentrop had ordered that the most secret records of the German Foreign Office from 1933 on, amounting to some 9,800 pages, be microfilmed. When the various departments of the Foreign Office in Berlin were evacuated to Thuringia at the end of the war, Karl von Loesch, a civil servant who had worked for the chief interpreter Paul Otto Schmidt, was entrusted with these microfilm copies. He eventually received orders to destroy the secret documents but decided to bury the metal container with the microfilms as a personal insurance for his future well-being. In May 1945, von Loesch approached the British Lt. Col. Robert C. Thomson with the request to transmit a personal letter to Duncan Sandys, Churchill's son-in-law. In the letter, von Loesch revealed that he had knowledge of the documents' whereabouts but expected preferential treatment in return. Colonel Thomson and his American counterpart Ralph Collins agreed to transfer von Loesch to Marburg in the American zone if he would produce the microfilms. The microfilms contained a copy of the Non-Aggression Treaty as well as the Secret Protocol. Both documents were discovered as part of the microfilmed records in August 1945 by the State Department employee Wendell B.

Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947. In November 1947, President Truman personally approved the publication but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December. Since negotiations at that conference did not prove constructive from an American point of view, the document edition was sent to press. The documents made headlines worldwide.

In December 1989, the commission concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed its findings to the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. As a result, the Congress passed the declaration confirming the existence of the secret protocols, condemning and denouncing them. Both successor-states of the pact parties have declared the secret protocols to be invalid from the moment they were signed.

Stalin immediately directed Molotov to &quot;purge the ministry of Jews.&quot; Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's &quot;modus operandi&quot; was &quot;more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.&quot; Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British–French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was ordered to remove the Jews from the Ministry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Molotov</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave the order to remove the Jews from the Ministry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stalin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believed that the firing of Litvinov allowed the Soviets to quicker negotiations with Germany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Derek Watson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believed that the hiring of Molotov would result in a better deal with the western countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geoffrey Roberts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Edward Hallett Carr, a frequent defender of Soviet policy, stated: &quot;In return for 'non-intervention' Stalin secured a breathing space of immunity from German attack.&quot;[page needed] According to Carr, the &quot;bastion&quot; created by means of the Pact, &quot;was and could only be, a line of defense against potential German attack.&quot;[page needed] According to Carr, an important advantage was that &quot;if Soviet Russia had eventually to fight Hitler, the Western Powers would already be involved.&quot;[page needed] However, during the last decades, this view has been disputed.
