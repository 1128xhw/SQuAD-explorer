Truman signed an executive order dissolving the OSS, and by October 1945 its functions had been divided between the Departments of State and War. The division lasted only a few months. The first public mention of the &quot;Central Intelligence Agency&quot; appeared on a command-restructuring proposal presented by Jim Forrestal and Arthur Radford to the U.S. Senate Military Affairs Committee at the end of 1945.

In particular, the agency failed to predict the Chinese entry into the Korean War with 300,000 troops. The famous double agent Kim Philby was the British liaison to American Central Intelligence. Through him the CIA coordinated hundreds of airdrops inside the iron curtain, all compromised by Philby. Arlington Hall, the nerve center of CIA cryptanalysisl was compromised by Bill Weisband, a Russian translator and Soviet spy. The CIA would reuse the tactic of dropping plant agents behind enemy lines by parachute again on China, and North Korea. This too would be fruitless.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did the Chinese enter into the Korean War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">300,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who compromised hundreds of airdrops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kim Philby</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a Russian translator and Soviet Spy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bill Weisband</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
