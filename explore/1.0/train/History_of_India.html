The Indus Valley Civilization which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent from c. 3200 to 1300 BCE, was the first major civilization in South Asia. A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE. This civilization collapsed at the start of the second millennium BCE and was later followed by the Iron Age Vedic Civilization, which extended over much of the Indo-Gangetic plain and which witnessed the rise of major polities known as the Mahajanapadas. In one of these kingdoms, Magadha, Mahavira and Gautama Buddha propagated their Shramanic philosophies during the fifth and sixth century BCE.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how long have modern humans lived on the Indian subcontinent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">75,000 years </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long ago did earlier hominids live on the Indian subcontinent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">500,000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Indus Valley Civilization thrive on the Indian subcontinent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">c. 3200 to 1300 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first major civilization in South Asia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indus Valley Civilization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the span of the Mature Harappan period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2600 to 1900 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE.

Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BC and was exported to foreign countries. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years, among which the Gupta Empire stands out. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or &quot;Golden Age of India&quot;. During this period, aspects of Indian civilization, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE.

Historians formerly postulated an &quot;epic age&quot; as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognize that the texts (which are both familiar with each other) went through multiple stages of development over centuries. For instance, the Mahabharata may have been based on a small-scale conflict (possibly about 1000 BCE) which was eventually &quot;transformed into a gigantic epic war by bards and poets&quot;. There is no conclusive proof from archaeology as to whether the specific events of the Mahabharat have any historical basis. The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE. Some even attempted to date the events using methods of archaeoastronomy which have produced, depending on which passages are chosen and how they are interpreted, estimated dates ranging up to mid 2nd millennium BCE.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the principle texts of Hinduism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vedas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what language were the Vedas ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sanskrit </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the core epics of the Vedas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ramayana and Mahabharata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Vedic text is the longest single poem on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mahabharata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what type of clash is the Mahabharata thought to have been based?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small-scale conflict </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the time between 800 and 200 BCE the Shramana-movement formed, from which originated Jainism and Buddhism.

The Sātavāhanas were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India. They had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule.

The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of Brahmi and was used to write the Sanskrit language. The Shunga Empire played an imperative role in patronizing Indian culture at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the time span of the Shunga Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">187 to 78 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Shuga empire after the fall of the Maurya empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pushyamitra Shunga</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Pushyamitra Shunga rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">36 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What script variant was used to write the Sanskrit language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brahmi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What tradition did Shunga rulers help begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sponsorship of learning and art</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the reign of Khārabēḷa, the Chedi dynasty of Kaḷinga ascended to eminence and restored the lost power and glory of Kaḷinga, which had been subdued since the devastating war with Ashoka.

The Hindu-Arabic numerals, a positional numeral system, originated in India and was later transmitted to the West through the Arabs. Early Hindu numerals had only nine symbols, until 600 to 800 CE, when a symbol for zero was developed for the numeral system.

The Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimize their rule, but they also patronized Buddhism, which continued to provide an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. The military exploits of the first three rulers – Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II - brought much of India under their leadership. Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural centre and established it as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions in Burma, Sri Lanka, Maritime Southeast Asia, and Indochina.

The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions, an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a notable ruler with whom even the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy.

The Sena dynasty would later assume control of the Pala Empire, and the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states. These were the first of the Rajput states. The first recorded Rajput kingdoms emerged in Rajasthan in the 6th century, and small Rajput dynasties later ruled much of northern India. One Gurjar Rajput of the Chauhan clan, Prithvi Raj Chauhan, was known for bloody conflicts against the advancing Turkic sultanates. The Chola empire emerged as a major power during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I who successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka in the 11th century. Lalitaditya Muktapida (r. 724 CE–760 CE) was an emperor of the Kashmiri Karkoṭa dynasty, which exercised influence in northwestern India from 625 CE until 1003, and was followed by Lohara dynasty. He is known primarily for his successful battles against the Muslim and Tibetan advances into Kashmiri-dominated regions. Kalhana in his Rajatarangini credits king Lalitaditya with leading an aggressive military campaign in Northern India and Central Asia.

The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called &quot;Chalukyan architecture&quot;.

At its peak, the Rashtrakutas ruled from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions.[citation needed] The early kings of this dynasty were Hindu but the later kings were strongly influenced by Jainism. Govinda III and Amoghavarsha were the most famous of the long line of able administrators produced by the dynasty. Amoghavarsha, who ruled for 64 years, was also an author and wrote Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada work on poetics. Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora. Other important contributions are the sculptures of Elephanta Caves in modern Maharashtra as well as the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in modern Karnataka, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Arab traveler Suleiman described the Rashtrakuta Empire as one of the four great Empires of the world. The Rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the golden age of southern Indian mathematics. The great south Indian mathematician Mahāvīra (mathematician) lived in the Rashtrakuta Empire and his text had a huge impact on the medieval south Indian mathematicians who lived after him.

Founded by Gopala I, it was ruled by a Buddhist dynasty from Bengal in the eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. Though the Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism, they also patronised Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The morpheme Pala, meaning &quot;protector&quot;, was used as an ending for the names of all the Pala monarchs. The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala. Dharmapala is believed to have conquered Kanauj and extended his sway up to the farthest limits of India in the northwest. The Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal in many ways. Dharmapala founded the Vikramashila and revived Nalanda, considered one of the first great universities in recorded history. Nalanda reached its height under the patronage of the Pala Empire. The Palas also built many viharas. They maintained close cultural and commercial ties with countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet. Sea trade added greatly to the prosperity of the Pala kingdom.

They successfully united the South India under their rule and through their naval strength extended their influence in the Southeast Asian countries such as Srivijaya. Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia. Rajendra Chola I's navies went even further, occupying the sea coasts from Burma to Vietnam, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Lakshadweep (Laccadive) islands, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia and the Pegu islands. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia, as well as by the repeated embassies to China. They dominated the political affairs of Sri Lanka for over two centuries through repeated invasions and occupation. They also had continuing trade contacts with the Arabs in the west and with the Chinese empire in the east. Rajaraja Chola I and his equally distinguished son Rajendra Chola I gave political unity to the whole of Southern India and established the Chola Empire as a respected sea power. Under the Cholas, the South India reached new heights of excellence in art, religion and literature. In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas. Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in India.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area did the Cholas unite in the 9th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of power did the Chola dynasty become in south India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military, economic and cultural </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what area did the Chola Empire establish political unity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">whole of Southern India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what type of architecture did the Cholas excel? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Monumental</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From their contacts and conquests in surrounding sea areas, what did this establish the Chola empire as? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sea power</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Western Chalukya Empire (Kannada:ಪಶ್ಚಿಮ ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯ ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ) ruled most of the western Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries. Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control. During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuri, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the later half of the 12th century. The Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi. This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of Kannada, and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman Basava and the great mathematician Bhāskara II.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During waht centuries did the Western Chalukya rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10th and 12th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the architectural style of the Chalukyas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">transitional</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Chalukyas build most of their monuments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">central Karnataka</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Chalukya kings encourage writers to use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">native language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides the language of Kannada, what other old language was used during the western Chalukya dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sanskrit</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The early Islamic literature indicates that the conquest of India was one of the very early ambitions of the Muslims, though it was recognized as a particularly difficult one.

Additionally, Muslim trading communities flourished throughout coastal south India, particularly on the western coast where Muslim traders arrived in small numbers, mainly from the Arabian peninsula.

In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent, one must note that the northwestern sub-continent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar to those of the earlier invasions during the 1st millennium. What does however, make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernized modern Indian culture. At the same time it must be noted that overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where did raiders come to attack the agrarian Indians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Central Asia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After a history of raiding groups, what is not remarkable in the history of the subcontinent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim intrusions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before the Muslim invasions, what did previous invaders do in the local cultures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">assimilated</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Muslim invaders staunchly keep after invading?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamic identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of new Indian culture was formed from this mixture of cultures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mixed</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The subsequent Slave dynasty of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India, while the Khilji dynasty conquered most of central India but were ultimately unsuccessful in conquering and uniting the subcontinent.

The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction, first in the Deccan and later in the Dravidian idioms using the local granite. South Indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire in Kerala. The south Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama founded the famous Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south Indian mathematicians like Parameshvara, Nilakantha Somayaji and Jyeṣṭhadeva in medieval south India. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor. The empire reached its peak during the rule of Sri Krishnadevaraya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishna Deva Raya.

The Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from Marathas and Afghans. During the decline of the Mughal Empire, several smaller states rose to fill the power vacuum and themselves were contributing factors to the decline. In 1737, the Maratha general Bajirao of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao, however, easily routed the novice Mughal general and the rest of the imperial Mughal army fled. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army. This essentially brought an end to the Mughal Empire. In 1739, Nader Shah, emperor of Iran, defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal. After this victory, Nader captured and sacked Delhi, carrying away many treasures, including the Peacock Throne. The Mughal dynasty was reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. The remnants of the Mughal dynasty were finally defeated during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also called the 1857 War of Independence, and the remains of the empire were formally taken over by the British while the Government of India Act 1858 let the British Crown assume direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What groups invaded and damaged the Mughals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marathas and Afghans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who attacked and plundered Delhi in 1737?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maratha general Bajirao </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the final Commander-in-chief of the Mughal army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Nizam-ul-mulk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the site of the final battle for the Mughals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bhopal </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Indian Rebellion of 1857 also called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1857 War of Independence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Mughals were perhaps the richest single dynasty to have ever existed. During the Mughal era, the dominant political forces consisted of the Mughal Empire and its tributaries and, later on, the rising successor states – including the Maratha Empire – which fought an increasingly weak Mughal dynasty. The Mughals, while often employing brutal tactics to subjugate their empire, had a policy of integration with Indian culture, which is what made them successful where the short-lived Sultanates of Delhi had failed. This period marked vast social change in the subcontinent as the Hindu majority were ruled over by the Mughal emperors, most of whom showed religious tolerance, liberally patronising Hindu culture. The famous emperor Akbar, who was the grandson of Babar, tried to establish a good relationship with the Hindus. However, later emperors such as Aurangazeb tried to establish complete Muslim dominance, and as a result several historical temples were destroyed during this period and taxes imposed on non-Muslims. Akbar declared &quot;Amari&quot; or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the jizya tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local maharajas, and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique Indo-Saracenic architecture. It was the erosion of this tradition coupled with increased brutality and centralization that played a large part in the dynasty's downfall after Aurangzeb, who unlike previous emperors, imposed relatively non-pluralistic policies on the general population, which often inflamed the majority Hindu population.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the richest of all the dynasties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Mughals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What policy made the Mughals a successful dynasty? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">integration with Indian culture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Mughal ruler tried to form a good relationship with non-Muslims?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emperor Akbar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Mughal ruler tried to establish complete dominance over the Hindu populace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aurangazeb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what styles did Mughal Rulers merge their Tuko-Persian culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ancient Indian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The post-Mughal era was dominated by the rise of the Maratha suzerainty as other small regional states (mostly late Mughal tributary states) emerged, and also by the increasing activities of European powers.

The Maratha kingdom was founded and consolidated by Chatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha aristocrat of the Bhonsle clan who was determined to establish Hindavi Swarajya. Sir J.N. Sarkar described Shivaji as &quot;the last great constructive genius and nation builder that the Hindu race has produced&quot;.

In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, Delhi itself in Battle of Delhi (1737). The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region. He explained it with the example of Malwa region. Marathas built an efficient system of public administration known for its attention to detail. It succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids, up to levels previously enjoyed by the Mughals. For example, the cornerstone of the Maratha rule in Malwa rested on the 60 or so local tax collectors who advanced the Maratha ruler Peshwa a portion of their district revenues at interest. By 1760, the domain of the Marathas stretched across practically the entire subcontinent. The north-western expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I. The defeat of Marathas by British in third Anglo-Maratha Wars brought end to the empire by 1820. The last peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. With the defeat of the Marathas, no native power represented any significant threat for the British afterwards.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By when had the Maratha kingdom become an empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early 18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruled the Maratha Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peshwas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Peshwas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prime ministers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year had the Maratha Empire covered most of the subcontinent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1760</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the end, what empire defeated the Maratha Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> British</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Punjabi kingdom, ruled by members of the Sikh religion, was a political entity that governed the region of modern-day Punjab.

It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa, under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839) from an array of autonomous Punjabi Misls. He consolidated many parts of northern India into a kingdom. He primarily used his highly disciplined Sikh army that he trained and equipped to be the equal of a European force. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well qualified generals for his army. In stages, he added the central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, the Peshawar Valley, and the Derajat to his kingdom. This came in the face of the powerful British East India Company. At its peak, in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. This was among the last areas of the subcontinent to be conquered by the British.

This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757.

In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling a priority for the Raj in his famous minute of February 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English as the medium of instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated. The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world. The British Raj invested heavily in infrastructure, including canals and irrigation systems in addition to railways, telegraphy, roads and ports. However, historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer at the end of British rule than at the beginning and that impoverishment occurred because of the British.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Colonial government expand by legal means?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infrastructure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new law was created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian Penal Code</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who insisted that schooling be a priority in India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Babington Macaulay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did India build the forth largest rail system in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what feature of management did the British invest heavily?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infrastructure</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1905, Lord Curzon split the large province of Bengal into a largely Hindu western half and &quot;Eastern Bengal and Assam&quot;, a largely Muslim eastern half. The British goal was said to be for efficient administration but the people of Bengal were outraged at the apparent &quot;divide and rule&quot; strategy. It also marked the beginning of the organized anti-colonial movement. When the Liberal party in Britain came to power in 1906, he was removed. Bengal was reunified in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the new Secretary of State for India John Morley consulted with Congress leaders on political reforms. The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy's executive council. The Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged from 25 to 60 members and separate communal representation for Muslims was established in a dramatic step towards representative and responsible government. Several socio-religious organizations came into being at that time. Muslims set up the All India Muslim League in 1906. It was not a mass party but was designed to protect the interests of the aristocratic Muslims. It was internally divided by conflicting loyalties to Islam, the British, and India, and by distrust of Hindus. The Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sought to represent Hindu interests though the later always claimed it to be a &quot;cultural&quot; organization. Sikhs founded the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1920. However, the largest and oldest political party Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, is perceived to have attempted to keep a distance from the socio-religious movements and identity politics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What administer divided the province of Bengal in half?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lord Curzon </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the majority of the population of the western half of Bengal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hindu </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the religion of the western half of Bengal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What movement did the division of Bengal start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-colonial</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the biggest and oldest political party in India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian National Congress</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Bengali Renaissance refers to a social reform movement during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the Bengal region of India during the period of British rule dominated by English educated Bengali Hindus.
