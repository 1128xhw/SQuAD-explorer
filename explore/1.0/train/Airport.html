Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control tower. An airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars  and terminals. Larger airports may have fixed base operator services, airport aprons, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an aerodome with facilities for flights to take off and land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">airport </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an aerially accessible open space that includes at least one active surface such as a runway or a helipad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">landing area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aerodrome with facilities for flights to take off and land</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The majority of the world's airports are non-towered, with no air traffic control presence.

There are a number of aids available to pilots, though not all airports are equipped with them. Many airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain, snow, or fog. In the U.S. and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, a human observer or a combination of the two.

Landside areas include parking lots, public transportation train stations and access roads. Airside areas include all areas accessible to aircraft, including runways, taxiways and aprons. Access from landside areas to airside areas is tightly controlled at most airports. Passengers on commercial flights access airside areas through terminals, where they can purchase tickets, clear security check, or claim luggage and board aircraft through gates.

It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Link Light Rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the Silver Line T at Boston's Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion.

Bisbee-Douglas International Airport in Arizona was declared &quot;the first international airport of the Americas&quot; by US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington had a dirigible land in 1905 and planes in 1911 and is still in use. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916 as a military airfield, but only accepted civil aircraft from December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport in Sydney, Australia—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world's oldest continually operating commercial airports. Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000 foot (3,355 meter) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. Rome Ciampino Airport, opened 1916, is also a contender, as well as the Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok,Thailand, which opened in 1914. Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is generally agreed to be the world's oldest continually operating airfield?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">College Park Airport</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the College Park Airport established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1909 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who established the College Park Airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wilbur Wright</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many passengers does the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport serve each year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35,000,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Rome Ciampino Airport open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1916</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic.

And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very differently though.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a traffic pattern often called outside of the U.S.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">traffic pattern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What assures smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> traffic pattern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Due to this, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">so-called SLOT-times</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Generally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five &quot;legs&quot; that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000 ft (244 or 305 m) above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Traffic patterns are usually flown at what altitude above ground level?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">800 or 1,000 ft</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are standard traffic patterns right-handed or left-handed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">left-handed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does AGL stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">above ground level</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the main reasons pilots sit on the left side of the airplane?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Standard traffic patterns are left-handed</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At extremely large airports, a circuit is in place but not usually used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport, often before they even take off from their departure point. Large airports have a frequency called Clearance Delivery which is used by departing aircraft specifically for this purpose. This then allows aircraft to take the most direct approach path to the runway and land without worrying about interference from other aircraft. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At an extremely large airport, what is in place but not usually used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a circuit </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the frequency called that is used by departing aircraft for the purpose of requesting approach clearance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Clearance Delivery </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which aircraft request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> commercial with long routes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are a number of aids available to pilots, though not all airports are equipped with them. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually be the primary means for instrument landings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What helps pilots fly the approach for landing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">visual approach slope indicator </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does VASI stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">visual approach slope indicator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does VOR stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">VHF omnidirectional range</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What helps pilots find the direction to the airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">VHF omnidirectional range </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instruments do pilots use to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">instrument landing system </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway.

A tow tractor pulls the aircraft to one of the airbridges, The ground power unit is plugged in. It keeps the electricity running in the plane when it stands at the terminal.

Mobile stairs can give the ground crew more access to the aircraft's cabin. There is a cleaning service to clean the aircraft after the aircraft lands. Flight catering provides the food and drinks on flights. A toilet waste truck removes the human waste from the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft. A water truck fills the water tanks of the aircraft. A fuel transfer vehicle transfers aviation fuel from fuel tanks underground, to the aircraft tanks. A tractor and its dollies bring in luggage from the terminal to the aircraft. They also carry luggage to the terminal if the aircraft has landed, and is being unloaded. Hi-loaders lift the heavy luggage containers to the gate of the cargo hold. The ground crew push the luggage containers into the hold. If it has landed, they rise, the ground crew push the luggage container on the hi-loader, which carries it down. The luggage container is then pushed on one of the tractors dollies. The conveyor, which is a conveyor belt on a truck, brings in the awkwardly shaped, or late luggage. The airbridge is used again by the new passengers to embark the aircraft. The tow tractor pushes the aircraft away from the terminal to a taxi area. The aircraft should be off of the airport and in the air in 90 minutes.
