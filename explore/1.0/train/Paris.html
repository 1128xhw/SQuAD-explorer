A gradual immigration by the Franks also occurred in Paris in the beginning of the Frankish domination of Gaul which created the Parisian Francien dialects. Fortification of the Île-de-France failed to prevent sacking by Vikings in 845 but Paris' strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–86). In 987 Hugh Capet, Count of Paris (comte de Paris), Duke of the Franks (duc des Francs) was elected King of the Franks (roi des Franks).

On 24 August 1572, Paris was the site of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, when thousands of French Protestants were killed. The last of these wars, the eighth one, ended in 1594, after Henri IV had converted to Catholicism and was finally able to enter Paris as he supposedly declared Paris vaut bien une messe (&quot;Paris is well worth a Mass&quot;). The city had been neglected for decades; by the time of his assassination in 1610, Henry IV had rebuilt the Pont Neuf, the first Paris bridge with sidewalks and not lined with buildings, linked with a new wing the Louvre to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what years did the English soldiers occupy Paris during the Hundred Years War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1420 until 1436</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to liberate the city in 1429?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Joan of Arc </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 24 August 1572</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Henri IV assassinated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1610</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for rebuilding Paris in the 1600's</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry IV </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Louis XIV distrusted the Parisians and moved his court to Versailles in 1682, but his reign also saw an unprecedented flourishing of the arts and sciences in Paris.

The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France.

In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.[citation needed] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes. Modern Paris owes much to its late 19th century Second Empire remodelling by the Baron Haussmann: many of modern Paris' busiest streets, avenues and boulevards today are a result of that city renovation. Paris also owes its style to its aligned street-fronts, distinctive cream-grey &quot;Paris stone&quot; building ornamentation, aligned top-floor balconies, and tree-lined boulevards. The high residential population of its city centre makes it much different from most other western global cities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who remodeled Paris in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Baron Haussmann</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two islands remain in Paris today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was ile aux Cygnes created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1827</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Paris' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century, particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. In recent developments, a 1974-2010 building height limitation of 37 metres (121 ft) was raised to 50 m (160 ft) in central areas and 180 metres (590 ft) in some of Paris' peripheral quarters, yet for some of the city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect. The 210 metres (690 ft) Montparnasse tower was both Paris and France's tallest building until 1973, but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction. A new project for La Defense, called Hermitage Plaza, launched in 2009, proposes to build two towers, 85 and 86 stories or 320 metres high, which would be the tallest buildings in the European Union, just slightly shorter than the Eiffel Tower. They were scheduled for completion in 2019 or 2020, but as of January 2015 construction had not yet begun, and there were questions in the press about the future of the project.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the current height limitation in Paris in central areas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50 m</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Until 1973, what was Paris; tallest building?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Montparnasse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the project for La Defense called that has not yet been started?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hermitage Plaza</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Hermitage Plaza launched?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many towers were planned to be built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> two </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Parisian examples of European architecture date back more than a millennium; including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1014-1163); the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163-1345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239-1248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627-1641) and Les Invalides (1670-1708).

Many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population: these districts were socially mixed at first, but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).

Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital.

Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Gericault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Montmartre, painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907. Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of art did Paris help develop with painters like Gericault?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Romanticism </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what town did Picasso live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Montmartre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two towns were pinnacle for artistic production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Montmartre and Montparnasse </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between what two years did Picasso paint La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1905 and 1907</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre.

Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the first permanent photograph produced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1825</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invented the first permanent photograph?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nicéphore Niépce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Eugene Atget known for photographing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">street scenes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was knows for photographing night scenes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marcel Bovis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did poster art become an important art form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late nineteenth century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Louvre was the world's most visited art museum in 2014, with 9.3 million visitors.

The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period. The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola.

The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; &quot;bistro&quot; means &quot;quickly&quot; in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first cafe opened in Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 17th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the oldest cafe in Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cafe Procope </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of eating place is defined as a neighborhood restaurant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> bistro </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the brasserie made popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris Exposition of 1867</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Paris has been an international capital of high fashion since the 19th century, particularly in the domain of haute couture, clothing hand-made to order for private clients.

From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital's highest points of elevation. From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris' principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris' streets. This system is still a major part of Paris' modern water-supply network.
