It was released in the United States on 6 November 2015. It became the second James Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues after Skyfall, although it was not filmed with IMAX cameras. Spectre received mixed reviews upon its release; although criticised for its length, lack of screen time for new characters, and writing, it received praise for its action sequences and cinematography. The theme song, &quot;Writing's on the Wall&quot;, received mixed reviews, particularly compared to the previous theme; nevertheless, it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song and was nominated for the Academy Award in the same category. As of 20 February 2016[update], Spectre has grossed over $879 million worldwide.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was Spectre first shown in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">26 October 2015</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the first screening of Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Albert Hall in London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the US release date for Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 November 2015</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were two subjects of accolades for Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">action sequences and cinematography</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what category did Spectre receive a Golden Globe award?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Best Original Song</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first James Bond film to be screened at IMAX theaters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Skyfall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the theme song for the James Bond film Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Writing's on the Wall</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following Garreth Mallory's promotion to M, on a mission in Mexico City unofficially ordered by a posthumous message from the previous M, 007 James Bond kills three men plotting a terrorist bombing during the Day of the Dead and gives chase to Marco Sciarra, an assassin who survived the attack. In the ensuing struggle, Bond steals his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus, and then kills Sciarra by kicking him out of a helicopter. Upon returning to London, Bond is indefinitely suspended from field duty by M, who is in the midst of a power struggle with C, the head of the privately-backed Joint Intelligence Service, consisting of the recently merged MI5 and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to form alongside 8 other countries &quot;Nine Eyes &quot;, a global surveillance and intelligence co-operation initiative between nine member states, and uses his influence to close down the '00' section, believing it to be outdated.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what holiday do insurgents plan to detonate a bomb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Day of the Dead</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who removed James Bond from active service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">M</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is M's rival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group does C support England joining?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nine Eyes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which character is promoted to M?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Garreth Mallory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which holiday was the terrorist bombing planned for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Day of the Dead</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two intelligence groups merged to form Joint Intelligence Service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MI5 and MI6</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Bond take from Marco Sciarra?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his ring</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bond disobeys M's order and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral.

The dispute began after Fleming incorporated elements of an undeveloped film script written by McClory and screenwriter Jack Whittingham—including characters and plot points—into Thunderball, which McClory contested in court, claiming ownership over elements of the novel. In 1963, Fleming settled out of court with McClory, in an agreement which awarded McClory the film rights. This enabled him to become a producer for the 1965 film Thunderball—with Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as executive producers—and the non-Eon film Never Say Never Again, an updated remake of Thunderball, in 1983.[N 3] A second remake, entitled Warhead 2000 A.D., was planned for production and release in the 1990s before being abandoned.

After casting Bérénice Lim Marlohe, a relative newcomer, as Sévérine in Skyfall, Mendes consciously sought out a more experienced actor for the role of Madeleine Swann, ultimately casting Léa Seydoux in the role.

The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film. A car chase scene set along the banks of the Tiber River and through the streets of Rome featured an Aston Martin DB10 and a Jaguar C-X75. The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams, who built the original C-X75 prototype for Jaguar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two landmarks in Rome used in filming Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ponte Sisto bridge and the Roman Forum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group was responsible for the C-X75s featured in Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Williams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which auto maker did Williams first develop the C-X75?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jaguar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many engines did the C-X75 originally have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in England were scenes shot that represented a location in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bridge in Rome was a filming location?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ponte Sisto bridge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two cars were featured in a chase scene along the banks of the Tiber River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aston Martin DB10 and a Jaguar C-X75</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Formula One racing team developed the C-X75's used for filming.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Williams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company did the Williams Formula One team originally build the C-X75 prototype for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jaguar.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With filming completed in Rome, production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film's opening sequence, with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district. The planned scenes required the city square to be closed for filming a sequence involving a fight aboard a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter flown by stunt pilot Chuck Aaron, which called for modifications to be made to several buildings to prevent damage. This particular scene in Mexico required 1,500 extras, 10 giant skeletons and 250,000 paper flowers. Reports in the Mexican media added that the film's second unit would move to Palenque in the state of Chiapas, to film aerial manoeuvres considered too dangerous to shoot in an urban area.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Spectre filming take place after Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mexico City</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which celebration was featured in the Mexico City part of the production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Day of the Dead</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which areas were shown in the Day of the Dead scene in Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many additional actors were needed for the shoot in Mexico City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,500</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the scenes featuring planes shot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palenque</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What festival was included in the scenes shot in Mexico?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Day of the Dead festival</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of helicopter was used for the flight scenes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in Mexico were the Day of the Dead scenes shot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following filming in Mexico, and during a scheduled break, Craig was flown to New York to undergo minor surgery to fix his knee injury.

This was denied by producer Michael G.

In the UK it received a wider release than Skyfall, with a minimum of 647 cinemas including 40 IMAX screens, compared to Skyfall's 587 locations and 21 IMAX screens.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the first showing of Spectre held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Albert Hall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was Spectre first shown for general audiences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">26 October 2015</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What movie prompted IMAX to show Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Skyfall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What film opening was changed so it didn't compete with Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which film had a wider release in the UK, Skyfall or Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spectre.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As of 21 February 2016[update] Spectre has grossed $879.3 million worldwide; $138.1 million of the takings have been generated from the UK market and $199.8 million from North America.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money had Spectre made by 2/21/2016?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$879.3 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much revenue did Spectre generate from the United States, Mexico and Canada by 2/21/2016?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$199.8 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much revenue did Spectre produce from the British, Scottish, and Irish market by 2/21/2016?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$138.1 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the United Kingdom, the film grossed £4.1 million ($6.4 million) from its Monday preview screenings.

In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre &quot;comes off as exhausted and uninspired&quot;. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having &quot;nothing surprising&quot; and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes' Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as &quot;the worst 007 movie in 30 years&quot;. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as &quot;an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment&quot;, aspiring &quot;to be a serialized sequel&quot; and proving &quot;itself as a Saga&quot;. While noting that &quot;[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny&quot;, he had &quot;come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention.&quot; In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing &quot;The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies&quot;. Other positive reviews from Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, gave it a perfect 100 score, stating: “One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.” Stephen Whitty from the New York Daily News, gave it an 80 grade, saying: “Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn’t leave a huge impression as this film’s “Bond girl,” perhaps it’s because we’ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real “Bond woman” since Diana Rigg.” Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.” Michael Phillips over at the Chicago Tribune, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.” Guy Lodge from Variety, gave it a 70 score, stating: “What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.”</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which journalist considered Spectre the worst James Bond movie in three decades?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scott Mendelson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which writer for the San Francisco Chronicle awarded Spectre with a perfect score?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mick LaSalle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What score did the writer from the Chicago Tribune give to Spectre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">75</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The reviewer from Variety compares Spectre to which other Bond movie?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Skyfall</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Christopher Orr, writing in The Atlantic, also criticised the film, saying that Spectre &quot;backslides on virtually every [aspect]&quot;.
