Dinosaurs still thrived as new species such as Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Triceratops and Hadrosaurs dominated the food web. In the oceans, Mosasaurs ruled the seas to fill the role of the Ichthyosaurs, and huge plesiosaurs, such as Elasmosaurus, evolved. Also, the first flowering plants evolved. At the end of the Cretaceous, the Deccan traps and other volcanic eruptions were poisoning the atmosphere. As this was continuing, it is thought that a large meteor smashed into earth, creating the Chicxulub Crater in an event known as the K-T Extinction, the fifth and most recent mass extinction event, in which 75% of life on earth went extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.

In fact, by the middle Cretaceous, equatorial ocean waters (perhaps as warm as 20 °C in the deep ocean) may have been too warm for sea life,[dubious – discuss][citation needed] and land areas near the equator may have been deserts despite their proximity to water. The circulation of oxygen to the deep ocean may also have been disrupted.[dubious – discuss] For this reason, large volumes of organic matter that was unable to decompose accumulated, eventually being deposited as &quot;black shale&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is uncertain about the Cretaceous?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> climate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What atmospheric gas caused temperatures levels to be 10 degrees higher than today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> carbon dioxide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Cretaceous what climate was thought to be found in areas near the seas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deserts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did large amounts of deposited un-decomposed organic matter later become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">black shale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was about equal across the planet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">temperatures</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Late Triassic spans from 237 million to 200 million years ago.

Many coastal shallows were created, and that caused Ichthyosaurs to die out. Mosasaurs evolved to replace them as head of the seas. Some island-hopping dinosaurs, like Eustreptospondylus, evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient Europe. Other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction left behind, such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus. Of the most successful would be the Iguanodon which spread to every continent. Seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder, but dinosaurs still inhabited this area like the Leaellynasaura which inhabited the polar forests year-round, and many dinosaurs migrated there during summer like Muttaburrasaurus. Since it was too cold for crocodiles, it was the last stronghold for large amphibians, like Koolasuchus. Pterosaurs got larger as species like Tapejara and Ornithocheirus evolved.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the span of the Early Cretaceous?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">145 million to 100 million years </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event of the Early Cretaceous caused the extinction of several species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">expansion of seaways</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species died out due to the expansion of coastal shallows?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ichthyosaurs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species dominated the seas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mosasaurs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dinosaur spread to every continent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iguanodon</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sea levels began to rise during the Jurassic, which was probably caused by an increase in seafloor spreading.

The era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions. The climate of the Mesozoic was varied, alternating between warming and cooling periods. Overall, however, the Earth was hotter than it is today. Non-avian dinosaurs appeared in the Late Triassic and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the Jurassic, occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous.

The divided world would give opportunity for the diversification of new dinosaurs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years did the Late Jurassic cover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">163 million to 145 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the separation of Pangaea cause to become extinct?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sauropods and Ichthyosaurs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the extinction caused by the splitting of Pangaea called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the destruction of fern prairies and increasing shallows?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sea levels rose</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the rise in sea levels open in the seaways? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atlantic sea</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Triassic was generally dry, a trend that began in the late Carboniferous, and highly seasonal, especially in the interior of Pangaea. Low sea levels may have also exacerbated temperature extremes. With its high specific heat capacity, water acts as a temperature-stabilizing heat reservoir, and land areas near large bodies of water—especially the oceans—experience less variation in temperature. Because much of the land that constituted Pangaea was distant from the oceans, temperatures fluctuated greatly, and the interior of Pangaea probably included expansive areas of desert. Abundant red beds and evaporites such as halite support these conclusions, but evidence exists that the generally dry climate of the Triassic was punctuated by episodes of increased rainfall. Most important humid episodes were the Carnian Pluvial Event and one in the Rhaetian, few million years before the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the general rainfall in the Triassic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> dry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could have made temperatures more extreme?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Low sea levels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Because of distance form the sea and wide variance in temperatures, what was the interior of Pangaea like?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> desert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were there periods of during the Triassic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> increased rainfall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Carnian Pluvial event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> increased rainfall</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The dominant land plant species of the time were gymnosperms, which are vascular, cone-bearing, non-flowering plants such as conifers that produce seeds without a coating. This is opposed to the earth's current flora, in which the dominant land plants in terms of number of species are angiosperms. One particular plant genus, Ginkgo, is thought to have evolved at this time and is represented today by a single species, Ginkgo biloba.
