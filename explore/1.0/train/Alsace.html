The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik Mülhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871–1918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Stadtrepublik become a part of Alsace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4 January 1798</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did Germany hold possession over Lorrain-Alscace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1871–1918</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which other country had control over Alsace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did Germany and France switched and had control of Alscace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four times</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880. Alsace was united with the other Alemanni east of the Rhine into the stem duchy of Swabia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which three territories make up the Upper Rhine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who forced Christianity upon the Alsace people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Clovis' Merovingian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What occurred at the treaty of Verdun?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Lothar past away?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">855</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At about this time the surrounding areas experienced recurring fragmentation and reincorporations among a number of feudal secular and ecclesiastical lordships, a common process in the Holy Roman Empire. Alsace experienced great prosperity during the 12th and 13th centuries under Hohenstaufen emperors. Frederick I set up Alsace as a province (a procuratio, not a provincia) to be ruled by ministeriales, a non-noble class of civil servants. The idea was that such men would be more tractable and less likely to alienate the fief from the crown out of their own greed. The province had a single provincial court (Landgericht) and a central administration with its seat at Hagenau. Frederick II designated the Bishop of Strasbourg to administer Alsace, but the authority of the bishop was challenged by Count Rudolf of Habsburg, who received his rights from Frederick II's son Conrad IV. Strasbourg began to grow to become the most populous and commercially important town in the region. In 1262, after a long struggle with the ruling bishops, its citizens gained the status of free imperial city. A stop on the Paris-Vienna-Orient trade route, as well as a port on the Rhine route linking southern Germany and Switzerland to the Netherlands, England and Scandinavia, it became the political and economic center of the region. Cities such as Colmar and Hagenau also began to grow in economic importance and gained a kind of autonomy within the &quot;Decapole&quot; or &quot;Dekapolis&quot;, a federation of ten free towns.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was considered a common practice in during the Holy Roman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fragmentation and reincorporations among a number of feudal secular and ecclesiastical lordships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under who's rule did Alsace thrive under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hohenstaufen emperors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was was the name given to the Alsace provincinal court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Landgericht</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the route that linked Germany,Switzerland , Netherlands, and England</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris-Vienna-Orient trade route</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which other two cities also started to grow economically?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colmar and Hagenau</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As in much of Europe, the prosperity of Alsace came to an end in the 14th century by a series of harsh winters, bad harvests, and the Black Death. These hardships were blamed on Jews, leading to the pogroms of 1336 and 1339. In 1349, Jews of Alsace were accused of poisoning the wells with plague, leading to the massacre of thousands of Jews during the Strasbourg pogrom. Jews were subsequently forbidden to settle in the town. An additional natural disaster was the Rhine rift earthquake of 1356, one of Europe's worst which made ruins of Basel. Prosperity returned to Alsace under Habsburg administration during the Renaissance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About when did Alsace lose its prosperity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Alsace decline has a prospering territory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">harsh winters, bad harvests, and the Black Death</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group of people were wrongly blamed for all the disasters that struck the region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blamed on Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the jewish people accused of in Alsace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">accused of poisoning the wells with plague</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Rhine Rift earthquake occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1356,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Holy Roman Empire central power had begun to decline following years of imperial adventures in Italian lands, often ceding hegemony in Western Europe to France, which had long since centralized power. France began an aggressive policy of expanding eastward, first to the rivers Rhône and Meuse, and when those borders were reached, aiming for the Rhine. In 1299, the French proposed a marriage alliance between Philip IV of France's sister Blanche and Albert I of Germany's son Rudolf, with Alsace to be the dowry; however, the deal never came off. In 1307, the town of Belfort was first chartered by the Counts of Montbéliard. During the next century, France was to be militarily shattered by the Hundred Years' War, which prevented for a time any further tendencies in this direction. After the conclusion of the war, France was again free to pursue its desire to reach the Rhine and in 1444 a French army appeared in Lorraine and Alsace. It took up winter quarters, demanded the submission of Metz and Strasbourg and launched an attack on Basel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the names of the first two rivers France aggressively went to while expanding eastward?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rhône and Meuse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The French proposed a marriage between which two people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blanche and Albert </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the period when France was crushed military?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he Hundred Years' War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the French reach Alsace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1444</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1469, following the Treaty of St. Omer, Upper Alsace was sold by Archduke Sigismund of Austria to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Although Charles was the nominal landlord, taxes were paid to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. The latter was able to use this tax and a dynastic marriage to his advantage to gain back full control of Upper Alsace (apart from the free towns, but including Belfort) in 1477 when it became part of the demesne of the Habsburg family, who were also rulers of the empire.

Martin Bucer was a prominent Protestant reformer in the region. His efforts were countered by the Roman Catholic Habsburgs who tried to eradicate heresy in Upper Alsace. As a result, Alsace was transformed into a mosaic of Catholic and Protestant territories. On the other hand, Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) to the southwest of Alsace, belonging to the Counts of Württemberg since 1397, remained a Protestant enclave in France until 1793.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Strasbourg accept Protestantism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1523</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was known as a reformer in Strasbourg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Martin Bucer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the names given for the two groups that heavily dominated Alsace during this time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic and Protestant</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This situation prevailed until 1639, when most of Alsace was conquered by France so as to keep it out of the hands of the Spanish Habsburgs, who wanted a clear road to their valuable and rebellious possessions in the Spanish Netherlands. Beset by enemies and seeking to gain a free hand in Hungary, the Habsburgs sold their Sundgau territory (mostly in Upper Alsace) to France in 1646, which had occupied it, for the sum of 1.2 million Thalers. When hostilities were concluded in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, most of Alsace was recognized as part of France, although some towns remained independent. The treaty stipulations regarding Alsace were complex; although the French king gained sovereignty, existing rights and customs of the inhabitants were largely preserved. France continued to maintain its customs border along the Vosges mountains where it had been, leaving Alsace more economically oriented to neighbouring German-speaking lands. The German language remained in use in local administration, in schools, and at the (Lutheran) University of Strasbourg, which continued to draw students from other German-speaking lands. The 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau, by which the French king ordered the suppression of French Protestantism, was not applied in Alsace. France did endeavour to promote Catholicism; Strasbourg Cathedral, for example, which had been Lutheran from 1524 to 1681, was returned to the Catholic Church. However, compared to the rest of France, Alsace enjoyed a climate of religious tolerance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Habsburgs  sell the Sundgau territory to France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1646</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did France pay for Sundgau?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.2 million Thalers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1685 Edict Fontainebleau by way of the French King ordered what to be done?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the suppression of French Protestantism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The year 1789 brought the French Revolution and with it the first division of Alsace into the départements of Haut- and Bas-Rhin. Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; (as Marching song for the Army of the Rhine), which later became the anthem of France. &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg Philippe-Frédéric de Dietrich. Some of the most famous generals of the French Revolution also came from Alsace, notably Kellermann, the victor of Valmy, Kléber, who led the armies of the French Republic in Vendée and Westermann, who also fought in the Vendée.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the division of Alsace take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1789</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which song was played for the first time in Strasbourg that would later become the French national anthem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">La Marseillaise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the armies of the French Republic in Vendee and Westermann?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kellermann</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the same time, some Alsatians were in opposition to the Jacobins and sympathetic to the invading forces of Austria and Prussia who sought to crush the nascent revolutionary republic. Many of the residents of the Sundgau made &quot;pilgrimages&quot; to places like Mariastein Abbey, near Basel, in Switzerland, for baptisms and weddings. When the French Revolutionary Army of the Rhine was victorious, tens of thousands fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until 1799), it was often to find that their lands and homes had been confiscated. These conditions led to emigration by hundreds of families to newly vacant lands in the Russian Empire in 1803–4 and again in 1808. A poignant retelling of this event based on what Goethe had personally witnessed can be found in his long poem Hermann and Dorothea.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two countries sought to crush the nascent republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austria and Prussia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had happened to most of the people who fled Sungau during the war when they were allowed to return home?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lands and homes had been confiscated</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the poem by Goethe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hermann and Dorothea</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The population grew rapidly, from 800,000 in 1814 to 914,000 in 1830 and 1,067,000 in 1846. The combination of economic and demographic factors led to hunger, housing shortages and a lack of work for young people. Thus, it is not surprising that people left Alsace, not only for Paris – where the Alsatian community grew in numbers, with famous members such as Baron Haussmann – but also for more distant places like Russia and the Austrian Empire, to take advantage of the new opportunities offered there: Austria had conquered lands in Eastern Europe from the Ottoman Empire and offered generous terms to colonists as a way of consolidating its hold on the new territories. Many Alsatians also began to sail to the United States, settling in many areas from 1820 to 1850. In 1843 and 1844, sailing ships bringing immigrant families from Alsace arrived at the port of New York. Some settled in Illinois, many to farm or to seek success in commercial ventures: for example, the sailing ships Sully (in May 1843) and Iowa (in June 1844) brought families who set up homes in northern Illinois and northern Indiana. Some Alsatian immigrants were noted for their roles in 19th-century American economic development. Others ventured to Canada to settle in southwestern Ontario, notably Waterloo County.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of Alsace in 1846?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,067,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the reasons for people to begin leaving Alsace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hunger, housing shortages and a lack of work for young people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between what years did Alatians begin to sail towards the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1820 to 1850</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By 1790, the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500, about 3% of the provincial population. They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-Jewish regulations. They maintained their own customs, Yiddish language, and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis. Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages. They concentrated in trade, services, and especially in money lending. They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace. Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution, with full emancipation in 1791. However, local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806, imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews.[citation needed] In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities, where they integrated and acculturated, as antisemitism sharply declined. By 1831, the state began paying salaries to official rabbis, and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued. Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred, especially during the Revolution of 1848. Merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of Alsace in 1790?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22,500</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jews were banned from cities in Alsace, where were they forced to settle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in villages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in 1791 Jews were granted what by the French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">full emancipation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country was Alsace merged into during  1871-1918</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>France started the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), and was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia and other German states. The end of the war led to the unification of Germany. Otto von Bismarck annexed Alsace and northern Lorraine to the new German Empire in 1871; unlike other members states of the German federation, which had governments of their own, the new Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine was under the sole authority of the Kaiser, administered directly by the imperial government in Berlin. Between 100,000 and 130,000 Alsatians (of a total population of about a million and a half) chose to remain French citizens and leave Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen, many of them resettling in French Algeria as Pieds-Noirs. Only in 1911 was Alsace-Lorraine granted some measure of autonomy, which was manifested also in a flag and an anthem (Elsässisches Fahnenlied). In 1913, however, the Saverne Affair (French: Incident de Saverne) showed the limits of this new tolerance of the Alsatian identity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country defeated the French in 1871?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kingdom of Prussia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The end of the war led to which companies unification?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who annexed Alsace to the new German Empire in 1871?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Otto von Bismarck</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the First World War, to avoid ground fights between brothers, many Alsatians served as sailors in the Kaiserliche Marine and took part in the Naval mutinies that led to the abdication of the Kaiser in November 1918, which left Alsace-Lorraine without a nominal head of state. The sailors returned home and tried to found a republic. While Jacques Peirotes, at this time deputy at the Landrat Elsass-Lothringen and just elected mayor of Strasbourg, proclaimed the forfeiture of the German Empire and the advent of the French Republic, a self-proclaimed government of Alsace-Lorraine declared independence as the &quot;Republic of Alsace-Lorraine&quot;. French troops entered Alsace less than two weeks later to quash the worker strikes and remove the newly established Soviets and revolutionaries from power. At the arrival of the French soldiers, many Alsatians and local Prussian/German administrators and bureaucrats cheered the re-establishment of order (which can be seen and is described in detail in the reference video below). Although U.S. President Woodrow Wilson had insisted that the région was self-ruling by legal status, as its constitution had stated it was bound to the sole authority of the Kaiser and not to the German state, France tolerated no plebiscite, as granted by the League of Nations to some eastern German territories at this time, because Alsatians were considered by the French public as fellow Frenchmen liberated from German rule. Germany ceded the region to France under the Treaty of Versailles.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Aslations do to avoid conflict amongst themselves during the first World War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">served as sailors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the mayor that proclaimed independence from the German Empire for  Alsace-Lorraine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jacques Peirotes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who entered Alsace just two weeks after they declared independence? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the treaty that allowed Germany to ceded the land to France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treaty of Versailles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Alsace-Lorraine was occupied by Germany in 1940 during the Second World War. Although Germany never formally annexed Alsace-Lorraine, it was incorporated into the Greater German Reich, which had been restructured into Reichsgaue. Alsace was merged with Baden, and Lorraine with the Saarland, to become part of a planned Westmark. During the war, 130,000 young men from Alsace and Lorraine were inducted into the German army against their will (malgré-nous) and in some cases, the Waffen SS. Some of the latter were involved in war crimes such as the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre. Most of them perished on the eastern front. The few that could escape fled to Switzerland or joined the resistance. In July 1944, 1500 malgré-nous were released from Soviet captivity and sent to Algiers, where they joined the Free French Forces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Alsace-Lorraine occupied by Germany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1940</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many Alsace and Lorraine men were forced into the German army during World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">130,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group of people were released by the Russians to Algiers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">malgré-nous</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Alsace is one of the most conservative régions of France.

Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace-Moselle still provides for to the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine). Controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of this legal disposition, as well as on the exclusion of other religions from this arrangement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group or religion dominates the Aslatian population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Catholic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which other large religion also exist in Alsace due to the once German presence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the Union created by France's second largest Protestant church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UEPAL</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the Protestant Reformation, promoted by local reformer Martin Bucer, the principle of cuius regio, eius religio led to a certain amount of religious diversity in the highlands of northern Alsace.

Many accepted without discrimination Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews and Anabaptists. Multiconfessional villages appeared, particularly in the region of Alsace bossue. Alsace became one of the French regions boasting a thriving Jewish community, and the only region with a noticeable Anabaptist population. The schism of the Amish under the lead of Jacob Amman from the Mennonites occurred in 1693 in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. The strongly Catholic Louis XIV tried in vain to drive them from Alsace.

The German region Hesse uses a flag similar to the Rot-un-Wiss. As it underlines the Germanic roots of the region, it was replaced in 1949 by a new &quot;Union jack-like&quot; flag representing the union of the two déprtements. It has, however, no real historical relevance. It has been since replaced again by a slightly different one, also representing the two départements. With the purpose of &quot;Frenchizing&quot; the region, the Rot-un-Wiss has not been recognized by Paris. Some overzealous statesmen have called it a Nazi invention - while its origins date back to the XIth century and the Red and White banner of Gérard de Lorraine (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still known as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the departments' parliaments and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new &quot;super-region&quot; gathering Champagne-Ardennes, Lorraine and Alsace, namely on Colmar's statue of liberty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the historical flag of Alsace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rot-un-Wiss</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the German flag that was similar to the Rot-un-Wiss replaced by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Union jack-like&quot; flag</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the &quot;Union jack-like&quot; flag represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the union of the two déprtements</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which French city did not recognize the Rot-un-Wiss flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From the annexation of Alsace by France in the 17th century and the language policy of the French Revolution up to 1870, knowledge of French in Alsace increased considerably.
