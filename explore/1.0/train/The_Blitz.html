Over a period of 267 days, London was attacked 71 times, Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth eight times, Bristol six, Glasgow five, Southampton four, Portsmouth and Hull three and a minimum of one large raid on eight other cities. This was a result of a rapid escalation starting on 24 August 1940, when night bombers aiming for RAF airfields drifted off course and accidentally destroyed several London homes, killing civilians, combined with the UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill's retaliatory bombing of Berlin on the following night.[clarification needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the beginning date of the aerial raids on Great Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7 September 1940</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many days did the aerial raids on Great Britain last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">267 days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was London attacked?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">71 times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the UK Prime Minster at the time of the aerial raids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Winston Churchill</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city did Winston Churchill bomb in retaliation for the killing of civilians? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Berlin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From 7 September 1940, one year into the war, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. More than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged and more than 40,000Â civilians were killed, almost half of them in London. Ports and industrial centres outside London were also attacked. The main Atlantic sea port of Liverpool was bombed, causing nearly 4,000 deaths within the Merseyside area during the war. The North Sea port of Hull, a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, was subjected to 86 raids in the Hull Blitz during the war, with a conservative estimate of 1,200 civilians killed and 95 percent of its housing stock destroyed or damaged. Other ports including Bristol, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Southampton and Swansea were also bombed, as were the industrial cities of Birmingham, Belfast, Coventry, Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield. Birmingham and Coventry were chosen because of the Spitfire and tank factories in Birmingham and the many munitions factories in Coventry. The city centre of Coventry was almost destroyed, as was Coventry Cathedral.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many nights did the Luftwaffe bomb London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">57 consecutive nights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What north sea port was the secondary target for bombers that could not find their primary target?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sea port of Hull</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many homes in London were destroyed in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">More than one million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people were killed in Liverpool?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nearly 4,000 deaths</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city centre was destroyed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Coventry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender or significantly damage the war economy. The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East. In comparison to the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted in relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 inflicted some 42,000 civilian deaths, about the same as the entire Blitz.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Luftwaffe plan to invade Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Operation Sea Lion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people died in the bombing of Hamburg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">42,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date of the bombing of Hamburg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 1943</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of the Luftwaffe? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hitler</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1920s and 1930s, air power theorists Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell espoused the idea that air forces could win wars by themselves, without a need for land and sea fighting. It was thought there was no defence against air attack, particularly at night. Enemy industry, their seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, effectively taking away their means to resist. It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will, which might have led to the collapse of production and civil life. Democracies, where the populace was allowed to show overt disapproval of the ruling government, were thought particularly vulnerable. This thinking was prevalent in both the RAF and what was then known as the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) between the two world wars. RAF Bomber Command's policy in particular would attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 1920's and 30's to theorist thought wars could be won by air forces what were their names?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bombing of civilian's was believed to cause what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">collapse of civilian will</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does USAAC stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States Army Air Corps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of populace was believed to be most vulnerable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Democracies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of bombing raids were most favored?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">night</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Within the Luftwaffe, there was a more muted view of strategic bombing.

Contrary to popular belief, the Luftwaffe did not have a systematic policy of what became known as &quot;terror bombing&quot;.

The failure to implement his vision for the new Luftwaffe was largely attributable to his immediate successors. Ex-Army personnel Albert Kesselring and Hans-JÃ¼rgen Stumpff are usually blamed for the turning away from strategic planning and focusing on close air support. However, it would seem the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. These men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since early in their careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations because of pressure from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel. It was instead a mission that suited the Luftwaffe's existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Wever die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">air crash</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Wever die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1936</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took over for Wever after his death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albert Kesselring and Hans-JÃ¼rgen Stumpff</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two men were the most important in ground support?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What long time careers were Sperrle and Jeschonnek involved in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German air services</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Adolf Hitler failed to pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as he did to protection from enemy bombing, although he had promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood that it was possible to use bombers for major strategic purposes. He told the OKL in 1939 that ruthless employment of the Luftwaffe against the heart of the British will to resist could and would follow when the moment was right; however, he quickly developed a lively scepticism toward strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of the Blitz. He frequently complained of the Luftwaffe's inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying, &quot;The munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raidsÂ ... usually the prescribed targets are not hit&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the beginning of enemy bombing first promoted by Hitler?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1930</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Hitler feel the Luftwaffe was unsuccessful in bombing raids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prescribed targets are not hit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Hitler feel bombing wasn't working?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inability to damage industries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1939 Hitler said bombing of Britain would begin when?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the moment was right</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had skepticism towards strategic bombing? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adolf Hitler</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ultimately, Hitler was trapped within his own vision of bombing as a terror weapon, formed in the 1930s when he threatened smaller nations into accepting German rule rather than submit to air bombardment. This fact had important implications. It showed the extent to which Hitler personally mistook Allied strategy for one of morale breaking instead of one of economic warfare, with the collapse of morale as an additional bonus. Hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing. As the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s, he expected that the threat of German retaliation would persuade the Allies to adopt a policy of moderation and not to begin a policy of unrestricted bombing. His hope was â for reasons of political prestige within Germany itself â that the German population would be protected from the Allied bombings. When this proved impossible, he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime, and he redoubled efforts to mount a similar &quot;terror offensive&quot; against Britain in order to produce a stalemate in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Hitler threaten small nations into accepting German rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">air bombardment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What policy did Hitler hope the bombing of Allies would cause? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">policy of moderation </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of prestige was Hitler hoping for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">political </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Hitler use terror bombing against Britain? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to produce a stalemate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A major problem in the managing of the Luftwaffe was Hermann GÃ¶ring. Hitler believed the Luftwaffe was &quot;the most effective strategic weapon&quot;, and in reply to repeated requests from the Kriegsmarine for control over aircraft insisted, &quot;We should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided Luftwaffe&quot;. Such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in GÃ¶ring a jealous and damaging defence of his &quot;empire&quot; while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the Luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and GÃ¶ring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over. In 1940 and 1941, GÃ¶ring's refusal to cooperate with the Kriegsmarine denied the entire Wehrmacht military forces of the Reich the chance to strangle British sea communications, which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the British Empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Hitler have a conflict over running the air force?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hermann GÃ¶ring</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What strategy could have worked against the British Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strangle British sea communications</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Kriegsmarine try to gain control over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> aircraft </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Goring refuse to work with in 1940 and 1941?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Kriegsmarine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The deliberate separation of the Luftwaffe from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major &quot;communications gap&quot; between Hitler and the Luftwaffe, which other factors helped to exacerbate. For one thing, GÃ¶ring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When GÃ¶ring decided against continuing Wever's original heavy bomber programme in 1937, the Reichsmarschall's own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July 1939, GÃ¶ring arranged a display of the Luftwaffe's most advanced equipment at Rechlin, to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the major cause of the separation between the Luftwaffe and the other military structure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">communications gap</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Goring do because of his fear of Hitler?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">misrepresent what information</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Goring display the Luftwaffe's advanced equipment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1939</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's bombing program did Goring abandon in 1939? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wever</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city did Goring display the advance equipment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rechlin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Within hours of the UK and France declaring war on Germany on 3 September 1939, the RAF bombed German warships along the German coast at Wilhelmshaven.

British fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing Germany's by 2 to 1. The British produced 10,000 aircraft in 1940, in comparison to Germany's 8,000. The replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult. Both the RAF and Luftwaffe struggled to replace manpower losses, though the Germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew. The circumstances affected the Germans more than the British. Operating over home territory, British flyers could fly again if they survived being shot down. German crews, even if they survived, faced capture. Moreover, bombers had four to five crewmen on board, representing a greater loss of manpower. On 7 September, the Germans shifted away from the destruction of the RAF's supporting structures. German intelligence suggested Fighter Command was weakening, and an attack on London would force it into a final battle of annihilation while compelling the British Government to surrender.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Luftwaffe fail to locate their targets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> poor intelligence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did German crew members face if they were shot down over Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Britain's  fabrication  of fighter planes out paced Germany by what margin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2 to 1</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How big was the crew of a bomber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four to five crewmen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many aircraft did Britain produce in 1940?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10,000 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The decision to change strategy is sometimes claimed as a major mistake by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL).

It has also been argued that it was doubtful the Luftwaffe could have won air superiority before the &quot;weather window&quot; began to deteriorate in October. It was also possible, if RAF losses became severe, that they could pull out to the north, wait for the German invasion, then redeploy southward again. Other historians argue that the outcome of the air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical superiority of British naval forces and the inherent weakness of the Kriegsmarine would have made the projected German invasion, Unternehmen SeelÃ¶we (Operation Sea Lion), a disaster with or without German air superiority.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does OKL stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oberkommando der Luftwaffe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What month would the weather window begin to decline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If serious loss had happened to the RAF where might they have pulled out of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the north</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the German name of Operation Sea Lion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Unternehmen SeelÃ¶we</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had exponential larger naval forces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British naval forces </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Regardless of the ability of the Luftwaffe to win air superiority, Adolf Hitler was frustrated that it was not happening quickly enough.

The main focus of the bombing operations was against the city of London. The first major raid in this regard took place on 7 September. On 15 September, on a date known as the Battle of Britain Day, a large-scale raid was launched in daylight, but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain. Although there were a few large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October, the Luftwaffe switched its main effort to night attacks in order to reduce losses. This became official policy on 7 October. The air campaign soon got underway against London and other British cities. However, the Luftwaffe faced limitations. Its aircraftâDornier Do 17, Junkers Ju 88, and Heinkel He 111sâwere capable of carrying out strategic missions, but were incapable of doing greater damage because of bomb-load limitations. The Luftwaffe's decision in the interwar period to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons: Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939; the OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a heavy bomber force; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which British city did the Luftwaffe focus its bombing on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the large air raid that took place in daylight hours in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Britain Day</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main reason the Luftwaffe was not able to cause extensive damage with their missions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bomb-load limitations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of bombers was Germany not able to build?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four-engined bombers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the problem for the Luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence.

Moreover, OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population. The Luftwaffe's strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940â1941. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy.

However, the use of delayed-action bombs, while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to detonate.[c] Moreover, the British had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

This philosophy was impractical as Bomber Command lacked the technology and equipment and needed several years to develop it. This strategy retarded the development of fighter defences in the 1930s.

The first cross-beam acted as a warning for the bomb-aimer to start the bombing-clock which he would activate only when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the equipment's clock, with the second hand continuing.

The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. R. V. Jones, who started an in-depth investigation which discovered that the Luftwaffe's Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones therefore began a search for the German beams. Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30Â MHz receiver to detect them. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines. A subtle form of distortion was introduced. Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that widened its path, negating its ability to accurately locate targets.

The counter operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison, No. 80 Wing RAF.

The British were still one-third below the establishment of heavy anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the Boulton Paul Defiant; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type. AA defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who reorganised London's defences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Pile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The British were how far below the establishment of heavy anti-aircraft artillery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one-third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who relied on night fighters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dowding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boulton Paul Defiant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were AA defenses improved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by better use of radar and searchlights</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Airborne Interception radar (AI) was unreliable.

Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%.

Other sources say 449 bombers and a total of 530 short tons (480Â t) of bombs were dropped. The raid against Coventry was particularly devastating, and led to widespread use of the phrase &quot;to conventrate&quot;. Over 10,000 incendiaries were dropped. Around 21 factories were seriously damaged in Coventry, and loss of public utilities stopped work at nine others, disrupting industrial output for several months. Only one bomber was lost, to anti-aircraft fire, despite the RAF flying 125 night sorties. No follow up raids were made, as OKL underestimated the British power of recovery (as Bomber Command would do over Germany from 1943â1945). The Germans were surprised by the success of the attack. The concentration had been achieved by accident.

Instead, he wasted aircraft of FliegerfÃ¼hrer Atlantik (Flying Command Atlantic) on bombing mainland Britain instead of attacks against convoys. For GÃ¶ring, his prestige had been damaged by the defeat in the Battle of Britain, and he wanted to regain it by subduing Britain by air power alone. He was always reluctant to cooperate with Raeder.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the concession Goring made with the strategic bombing against Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Directive 23</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Goring believe the Kriegsmarine would gain with further support?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">control of more Luftwaffe units</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Raeder's successor? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karl DÃ¶nitz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was detrimental to the success of a strategic effect against Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GÃ¶ring's lack of cooperation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Goring expect to regain prestige?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by subduing Britain by air power alone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Even so, the decision by OKL to support the strategy in Directive 23 was instigated by two considerations, both of which had little to do with wanting to destroy Britain's sea communications in conjunction with the Kriegsmarine. First, the difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production was becoming apparent, and second, the conclusion British morale was unlikely to break led OKL to adopt the naval option. The indifference displayed by OKL to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect. They emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining pressure, or diverting strength, onto industries building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and explosives.

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials. The considerable rail network distributed to the rest of the country. Operations against Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz were successful. Air attacks sank 39,126 long tons (39,754Â t) of shipping, with another 111,601 long tons (113,392Â t) damaged. Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by civilians. Other sources point to half of the port's 144 berths rendered unusable, while cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75%. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour. On 8 May 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, sunk or damaged amounting to 80,000 long tons (81,000Â t). Around 66,000 houses were destroyed, 77,000 people made homeless, and 1,900 people killed and 1,450 seriously hurt on one night. Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale. The populace of the port of Hull became 'trekkers', people who underwent a mass exodus from cities before, during, and after attacks. However, the attacks failed to knock out or damage railways, or port facilities for long, even in the Port of London, a target of many attacks. The Port of London in particular was an important target, bringing in one-third of overseas trade.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the British fear most?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">intensification of submarine and air attack</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was an important destination for supply convoys from North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liverpool </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Liverpool Blitz sank how much shipping?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">39,126 long tons (39,754Â t) of shipping</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many ships were destroyed on May 8, 1941?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">57 ships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the overseas trade did the Port of London take on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one-third of overseas trade</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 13 March, the upper Clyde port of Clydebank near Glasgow was bombed.

Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily damaged, the electrical supply was knocked out, and five oil tanks and two magazines exploded. Nine days later, two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped heavy bombs, including 160 tons of high explosive and 32,000 incendiaries. Much of the city centre was destroyed. Damage was inflicted on the port installations, but many bombs fell on the city itself. On 17 April 346 tons of explosives and 46,000 incendiaries were dropped from 250 bombers led by KG 26. The damage was considerable, and the Germans also used aerial mines. Over 2,000 AAA shells were fired, destroying two Ju 88s.

The Luftwaffe dropped around 45,000 short tons (41,000Â t) of bombs during the Blitz disrupting production and transport, reducing food supplies and shaking the British morale. It also helped to support the U-Boat blockade by sinking some 58,000 long tons (59,000Â t) of shipping destroyed and 450,000 long tons (460,000Â t) damaged. Yet, overall the British production rose steadily throughout this period although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers of Easter Holidays according to the British official history. The British official history on war production noted the great impact was upon the supply of components rather than complete equipment. In aircraft production, the British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month, arguably the greatest achievement of the bombing, as it forced the dispersal of industry. In April 1941, when the targets were British ports, rifle production fell by 25%, filled-shell production by 4.6%, and in smallarms production 4.5% overall. The strategic impact on industrial cities was varied; most took from 10â15 days to recover from heavy raids, although Belfast and Liverpool took longer. The attacks against Birmingham took war industries some three months to recover fully from. The exhausted population took three weeks to overcome the effects of an attack.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Luftwaffe used how many short tons of bombs during the Blitz?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">45,000 short tons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Luftwaffe helped the U-boats by sinking how much shipping?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">58,000 long tons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the British production fare as a result of all the bombing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">overall the British production rose steadily throughout this period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the greatest achievement of the bombings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was the recovery of industrial cities from raids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most took from 10â15 days</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The air offensive against the RAF and British industry failed to have the desired effect. More might have been achieved had the OKL exploited their enemy's weak spot, the vulnerability of British sea communications. The Allies did so later when Bomber Command attacked rail communications and the United States Army Air Forces targeted oil, but that would have required an economic-industrial analysis of which the Luftwaffe was incapable. The OKL instead sought clusters of targets that suited the latest policy (which changed frequently), and disputes within the leadership were about tactics rather than strategy. Though militarily ineffective, the Blitz caused enormous damage to Britain's infrastructure and housing stock. It cost around 41,000 lives, and may have injured another 139,000.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How could have more been achieved in the air offensive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">had the OKL exploited their enemy's weak spot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the disputes in the OKL tend to be about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about tactics rather than strategy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Luftwaffe incapable of doing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an economic-industrial analysis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many casualties did the Blitz ultimately cause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cost around 41,000 lives, and may have injured another 139,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The relieved British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941, and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command's offensives.

They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport.

Throughout 1933â39 none of the 16 Western Air Plans drafted mentioned morale as a target. The first three directives in 1940 did not mention civilian populations or morale in any way. Morale was not mentioned until the ninth wartime directive on 21 September 1940. The 10th directive in October 1940 mentioned morale by name.

However, he did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command's offensives was to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare), and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the Battle of Berlin, he declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve &quot;a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable.&quot; A summary of Harris' strategic intentions was clear:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Without what could morale collapse occur according to Arthur Harris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">without the destruction of the German economy.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the primary strategy for Bomber Command offensives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare), and in doing so reduce morale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Arthur Harris announced that Bomber Command would enable economic warfare to achieve what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A converse popular image arose of British people in the Second World War: a collection of people locked in national solidarity. This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of Angus Calder's book The Myth of the Blitz (1991). It was evoked by both the right and left political factions in Britain during the Falklands War when it was embedded in a nostalgic narrative in which the Second World War represented aggressive British patriotism successfully defending democracy. This imagery of people in the Blitz was and is powerfully portrayed in film, radio, newspapers and magazines. At the time it was a useful propaganda tool for home and foreign consumption. Historians' critical response to this construction focused on what were seen as over-emphasised claims of righteous nationalism and national unity. In the Myth of the Blitz, Calder exposed some of the counter-evidence of anti-social and divisive behaviours. What he saw as the mythâserene national unityâbecame &quot;historical truth&quot;. In particular, class division was most evident.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What view became popular of the British people in WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">people locked in national solidarity.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did this popular view come to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of Angus Calder's book The Myth of the Blitz (1991).</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Political factions in Britain supported what view of Britains in WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aggressive British patriotism successfully defending democracy.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Historians' critical response to this view?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over-emphasised claims of righteous nationalism and national unity.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Calder try to expose in his book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">some of the counter-evidence of anti-social and divisive behaviours</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the wake of the Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, in particular, took to using the Underground railway system, without authority, for shelter and sleeping through the night there until the following morning. So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the Police were sent in to seize their production facilities. The Government, up until November 1940, was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter. Home Secretary Sir John Anderson was replaced by Morrison soon afterwards, in the wake of a Cabinet reshuffle as the dying Neville Chamberlain resigned. Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made. He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their condition and expand them by tunnelling. Still, many British citizens, who had been members of the Labour Party, itself inert over the issue, turned to the Communist Party. The Communists attempted to blame the damage and casualties of the Coventry raid on the rich factory owners, big business and landowning interests and called for a negotiated peace. Though they failed to make a large gain in influence, the membership of the Party had doubled by June 1941. The &quot;Communist threat&quot; was deemed important enough for Herbert Morrison to order, with the support of the Cabinet, the stoppage of the Daily Worker and The Week; the Communist newspaper and journal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the communist party agitated over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the need for bomb-proof shelters.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Londoners use for bomb-shelters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Underground railway system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Morrison warn he couldn't do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Communists blame for the damage in the Conventry raids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the rich factory owners, big business and landowning interests</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Morrison forced to do in response to the Communist Party?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the stoppage of the Daily Worker and The Week; the Communist newspaper and journal.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The brief success of the Communists also fed into the hands of the British Union of Fascists (BUF).

Over a quarter of London's population had left the city by November 1940. Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population south Wales and Gloucester intimated where these displaced people went. Other reasons, including industry dispersal may have been a factor. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order. The total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. Far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, 88% of evacuated mothers, 86% of small children, and 43% of school children had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the Phoney War contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was another reason for populations moving?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">industry dispersal may have been a factor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of London's population left?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Over a quarter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What locations saw an increase in populations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">outh Wales and Gloucester</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the population returned in four months?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">88% of evacuated mothers, 86% of small children, and 43% of school children</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many evacuees were there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.4 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In recent years a large number of wartime recordings relating to the Blitz have been made available on audiobooks such as The Blitz, The Home Front and British War Broadcasting.
