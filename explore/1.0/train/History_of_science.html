(The history of the arts and humanities is termed as the history of scholarship.)

Previously, people investigating nature called themselves natural philosophers. While empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity (for example, by Thales, Aristotle, and others), and scientific methods have been employed since the Middle Ages (for example, by Ibn al-Haytham, and Roger Bacon), the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe. Scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific. Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who coined the word &quot;scientist&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Whewell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the word &quot;scientist&quot; created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are people who study nature called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural philosophers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ibn al-Haytham and Roger Bacon were scientists in which time period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Middle Ages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the beginning of modern science considered to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the scientific revolution</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented in a progressive narrative in which true theories replaced false beliefs.

Combined with the development of agriculture, which allowed for a surplus of food, it became possible for early civilizations to develop, because more time and effort could be devoted to tasks (other than food production) than hunter-gatherers or early subsistence farmers had available. This surplus allowed a community to support individuals who did things other than work towards bare survival.

Their development of geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the Nile river. The 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of thumb were used to build rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt was also a center of alchemy research for much of the Mediterranean.The Edwin Smith papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience. However, while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective. Nevertheless, it applies the following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, which display strong parallels to the basic empirical method of science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The Ebers papyrus (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional empiricism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which civilization advanced in astronomy, mathematics, and medicine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ancient Egypt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Egyptians use to better organize their farmland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">geometry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What theory did the Egyptians use to build rectilinear structures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The 3-4-5 right triangle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What research was Egypt known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alchemy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the earliest medical document?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Edwin Smith papyrus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From their beginnings in Sumer (now Iraq) around 3500 BC, the Mesopotamian people began to attempt to record some observations of the world with numerical data.

Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu, a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was &quot;the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena.&quot; According to the historian A.

Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry. Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC, whose motto was &quot;Let none unversed in geometry enter here&quot;, and turned out many notable philosophers. Plato's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method. Aristotle also produced many biological writings that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, classified more than 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. Aristotle's writings profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic and European scholarship, though they were eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Plato and Aristotle are known for systematically discussing what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural philosophy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What discussion technique are Plato and Aristotle responsible for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deductive reasoning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Platonic Academy founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">387 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aristotle introduced what theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">empiricism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many species of animals were classified by Aristotle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">540</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in anatomy, zoology, botany, mineralogy, geography, mathematics and astronomy; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research. In the Hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations. Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Muslim philosophers and scientists, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the secular sciences of the modern day. Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks, but the Socratic method did, along with the idea of Forms, great advances in geometry, logic, and the natural sciences.

Pliny the Elder produced what is one of the largest encyclopedias of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus. For example, he accurately describes the octahedral shape of the diamond, and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by engravers to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of crystal shape is a precursor to modern crystallography, while mention of numerous other minerals presages mineralogy. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the crystal habit with the work of lapidaries. He was also the first to recognise that amber was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What classification guide did Theophrastus create?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the first taxonomy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Pliny the Elder publish the largest encyclopedia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 77 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Pliny the Elder observe about diamonds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the octahedral shape</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who do engravers use diamond dust for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to cut and polish other gems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What characteristic was Pliny the Elder the first to recognize about amber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">was a fossilized resin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mathematics: The earliest traces of mathematical knowledge in the Indian subcontinent appear with the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 4th millennium BC ~ c. 3rd millennium BC).

The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily, and during the Reconquista and the Crusades, allowed Europeans access to scientific Greek and Arabic texts, including the works of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Jābir ibn Hayyān, al-Khwarizmi, Alhazen, Avicenna, and Averroes. European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo, who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin. Later translators like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum, with the result that the &quot;medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were medieval universities created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 12th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sponsored the Toledo School of Translators?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Raymond of Toledo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the Toledo School of Translators, what language was Arabic text translated into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which translator learned Arabic to be able to study the Arabic texts directly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Michael Scotus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy contained in these texts began to be extended by notable scholastics such as Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus and Duns Scotus. Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his Opus Majus. Pierre Duhem's provocative thesis of the Catholic Church's Condemnation of 1277 led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, &quot;but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277&quot;.

Scholars such as Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of inertia.

Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas.

The Northern Renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation; the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus; the Fall of Constantinople; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned religious doctrine. The works of Ptolemy (astronomy) and Galen (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by Vesalius on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The focus on learning in the 12th century is referred to as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scholasticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What began at the same time Scholasticism ended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Black Death</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which era came after Scholasticism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italian Renaissance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the focus of the Northern Renaissance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chemistry and the biological sciences</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scientist was known for working on human cadavers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vesalius</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the Scientific Revolution.

By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry, the precursor to biochemistry. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What scientific act is Friedrich Wohler known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The synthesis of urea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What scientific field did Wohler discover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">organic chemistry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Late 19th century is marked by what event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mixing organic chemistry with living organisms created what early form of biochemistry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">physiological chemistry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote The Nature of the Chemical Bond?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Linus Pauling</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Geology existed as a cloud of isolated, disconnected ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science.

Benoît de Maillet and the Comte de Buffon saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars. Jean-Étienne Guettard and Nicolas Desmarest hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps. Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such as Scotland's John Walker, Sweden's Torbern Bergman, and Germany's Abraham Werner created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals—a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century. These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led James Hutton, Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart, following in the steps of Steno, to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the 19th century, geologists such as Charles Lyell, Adam Sedgwick, and Roderick Murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old did biblical scholars think the Earth was?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6,000 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jean-Etienne Guettard and NIcolas Desmarest went to France and recorded what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the first geological maps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 18th century, what changed geology drastically?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are used to create geological maps?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">index fossils</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What geological theory was applied to the Paris Basin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Midway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand how the surface of the Earth had changed.

Louis Agassiz and others established the reality of continent-covering ice ages, and &quot;fluvialists&quot; like Andrew Crombie Ramsay argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them. After the discovery of radioactivity, radiometric dating methods were developed, starting in the 20th century. Alfred Wegener's theory of &quot;continental drift&quot; was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of plate tectonics, which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate tectonics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena.

Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of &quot;man's place in the universe&quot;. In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics, which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms. In the late 20th century, the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome (the Human Genome Project).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scientist championed the idea of evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Darwin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the book that Darwin wrote about evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">On the Origin of Species</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the reception of Darwin's ideas about evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both opposition and support from different parts of society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who rediscovered the laws of inheritance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Moravian monk Gregor Mendel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the major break through for the study of genetics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the basic structure of DNA</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The discipline of ecology typically traces its origin to the synthesis of Darwinian evolution and Humboldtian biogeography, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The word ecology was coined by Ernst Haeckel, whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930s, Arthur Tansley and others began developing the field of ecosystem ecology, which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of field biology.

Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique générale created the development of descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages.

Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The Austrian school responded to Marxian economics by viewing entrepreneurship as driving force of economic development.

New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as PET scans and CAT scans, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as artificial intelligence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the group that human psychology belongs to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cognitive science</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is investigated in cognitive science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mind</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What inventions advanced the study of cognitive science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PET scans and CAT scans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new technology could be created as a result of studying cognitive science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">artificial intelligence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ibn Khaldun can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist. The modern sociology, emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., Émile Durkheim), the aim of sociology was in structuralism, understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an &quot;antidote&quot; to social disintegration. Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization, which he believed would trap individuals in an &quot;iron cage&quot; of rational thought. Some sociologists, including Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois, utilized more microsociological, qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of George Herbert Mead and his student Herbert Blumer resulting in the creation of the symbolic interactionism approach to sociology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Ibn Khaldun's profession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scientific systematic sociologist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did modern sociology surface?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> early 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main goal of sociology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">understanding the cohesion of social groups</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Max Weber view rationalization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he believed would trap individuals in an &quot;iron cage&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by Talcott Parsons, who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore &quot;functional&quot;. This structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, conflict theory was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of Karl Marx. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. Erving Goffman saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing &quot;backstage&quot; and attempting to control their audience through impression management. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including feminist theory, post-structuralism, rational choice theory, and postmodernism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the major proponent of American sociology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Talcott Parsons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Parsons believe made a functional society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">structural integration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the problem with the views of Parsons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inequalities present in the status quo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What idea from Karl Marx was used to combat the problems with structural integration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conflict theory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main belief of conflict theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">different groups compete for control over resources</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Computer science, built upon a foundation of theoretical linguistics, discrete mathematics, and electrical engineering, studies the nature and limits of computation.

A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton's publications, Introduction to the History of Science (1927) and the Isis journal (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians. With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard, the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What text is the foundation of the study of the history of science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">History of the Inductive Sciences</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote a more professional version of History of the Inductive Sciences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Sarton'</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the history of science during the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the history of great men and great ideas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How could Sarton's ideas be described?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Whiggish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who studied the history of science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">interested scientists and physicians</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science is, how it functions, and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.

Since the 1960s, a common trend in science studies (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the &quot;human component&quot; of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free.

As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. &quot;Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the social aspect of science originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What idea did social science add to science as a whole?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Kuhn view the history of science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">competing paradigms or conceptual systems</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge.

They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while scientism, a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies. However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that &quot;dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.
