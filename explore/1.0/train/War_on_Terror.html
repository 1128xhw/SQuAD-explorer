In March 2009, the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term, instead using &quot;Overseas Contingency Operation&quot;. Basic objectives of the Bush administration &quot;war on terror&quot;, such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances, remain in place. In December 2012, Jeh Johnson, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University, predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective, and has been &quot;effectively destroyed&quot;, and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law. In May 2013, Obama stated that the goal is &quot;to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America&quot;; which coincided with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget having changed the wording from &quot;Overseas Contingency Operations&quot; to &quot;Countering Violent Extremism&quot; in 2010.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Obama say the US is at war with, in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a far-reaching network of violence and hatred</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the &quot;Global War on Terror&quot; officially renamed to in March 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Overseas Contingency Operation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term did Obama want the government to stop using?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">war on terror</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said in 2012 that the fight would change from military to law enforcement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jeh Johnson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the  &quot;Overseas Contingency Operations&quot; renamed to in 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Countering Violent Extremism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because the actions involved in the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; are diffuse, and the criteria for inclusion are unclear, political theorist Richard Jackson has argued that &quot;the 'war on terrorism' therefore, is simultaneously a set of actual practices—wars, covert operations, agencies, and institutions—and an accompanying series of assumptions, beliefs, justifications, and narratives—it is an entire language or discourse.&quot; Jackson cites among many examples a statement by John Ashcroft that &quot;the attacks of September 11 drew a bright line of demarcation between the civil and the savage&quot;. Administration officials also described &quot;terrorists&quot; as hateful, treacherous, barbarous, mad, twisted, perverted, without faith, parasitical, inhuman, and, most commonly, evil.

The United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China supported the Islamist Afghan mujahadeen guerillas against the military forces of the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. A small number of &quot;Afghan Arab&quot; volunteers joined the fight against the Soviets, including Osama bin Laden, but there is no evidence they received any external assistance. In May 1996 the group World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders (WIFJAJC), sponsored by bin Laden (and later re-formed as al-Qaeda), started forming a large base of operations in Afghanistan, where the Islamist extremist regime of the Taliban had seized power earlier in the year. In February 1998, Osama bin Laden signed a fatwā, as head of al-Qaeda, declaring war on the West and Israel, later in May of that same year al-Qaeda released a video declaring war on the U.S. and the West.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which war gave birth to al-Qaeda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Soviet war in Afghanistan </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Soviets leave Afghanistan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> February 1989</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries supported Afghan islamists against the Soviets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Osama bin Laden volunteer to help fight in the 80s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group later became al-Qaeda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 7 August 1998, al-Qaeda struck the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans.

The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell – intentionally crashed two airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just outside Washington D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington D.C., to target the White House, or the U.S. Capitol.

In February 2010, Coalition forces launched Operation Moshtarak in southern Afghanistan along with other military offensives in the hopes that they would destroy the Taliban insurgency once and for all. Peace talks are also underway between Taliban affiliated fighters and Coalition forces.

However, an insurgency arose against the U.S.-led coalition and the newly developing Iraqi military and post-Saddam government. The insurgency, which included al-Qaeda affiliated groups, led to far more coalition casualties than the invasion. Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein's Ba'ath regime, which included Iraqi nationalists and pan-Arabists. Many insurgency leaders are Islamists and claim to be fighting a religious war to reestablish the Islamic Caliphate of centuries past. Iraq's former president, Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in December 2003.

While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that Al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence. An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence. A team of Special Air Service and Delta Force was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir in 2002 to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. U.S. officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Fazlur Rehman Khalil, the leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, signed al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of holy war, which called on Muslims to attack all Americans and their allies. Indian sources claimed that In 2006, Al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this worried the Indian government. India also claimed that Al-Qaeda has strong ties with the Kashmir militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan. While on a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, U.S. Defense secretary Robert Gates stated that Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'Letter to American People' in 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Osama bin Laden </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the US Secretary of Defense in 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Donald Rumsfeld </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group did Rumsfeld think was active in Kashmir?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Al-Qaeda</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What teams hunted for Bin Laden in Kashmir in 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Special Air Service and Delta Force </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fazlur Rehman Khalil</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In September 2009, a U.S. Drone strike reportedly killed Ilyas Kashmiri, who was the chief of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, a Kashmiri militant group associated with Al-Qaeda.

The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new Terrorist Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by The New York Times). Global telecommunication usage, including those with no links to terrorism, is being collected and monitored through the NSA electronic surveillance program.
