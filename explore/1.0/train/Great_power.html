Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a nation which can exert its influence on a global scale called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A great power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two dominant traits do great powers usually possess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military and economic strength</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States serve as what body's five permanent members?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Nations Security Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two lesser traits do great powers usually possess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diplomatic and soft power influence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States are part of what international forum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the G7</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do great powers usually have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the permanent members of UN Security Council?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the countries in the G7?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 3 factors have international relations theorists considered factors for great power status?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The term &quot;great power&quot; was first used to represent the most important powers in Europe during the post-Napoleonic era. The &quot;Great Powers&quot; constituted the &quot;Concert of Europe&quot; and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties. The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Since then, the international balance of power has shifted numerous times, most dramatically during World War I and World War II. While some nations are widely considered to be great powers, there is no definitive list of them. In literature, alternative terms for great power are often world power or major power, but these terms can also be interchangeable with superpower.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The term &quot;great power&quot; was first used on which continent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which treaty made the distinction of small powers and great powers a formal affair?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treaty of Chaumont</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was this treaty signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1814</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which two wars has the balance of power shifted the most dramatically?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War I and World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another more modern term used in place of &quot;great power&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">superpower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the formalization of the division of small powers and great powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treaty of Chaumont</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the post Napoleonic era where were the first Great Powers concentrated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for Great Power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">superpower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what 2 wars was the balance of power shift most dramatic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War I and World War II</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Early writings on the subject tended to judge states by the realist criterion, as expressed by the historian A. J. P. Taylor when he noted that &quot;The test of a great power is the test of strength for war.&quot; Later writers have expanded this test, attempting to define power in terms of overall military, economic, and political capacity. Kenneth Waltz, the founder of the neorealist theory of international relations, uses a set of five criteria to determine great power: population and territory; resource endowment; economic capability; political stability and competence; and military strength. These expanded criteria can be divided into three heads: power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What one criteria was used in early times to judge a great power's status?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strength for war</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides military, what two other capacities were used to describe great powers in later times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">economic, and political</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the founder of the neorealist theory of international relations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kenneth Waltz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many criteria are used to judge a great power in the neorealist theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote, &quot;The test of a great power is the test of strength for war.&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A.

Others, such as Russia and Austria-Hungary, stagnated. At the same time, other states were emerging and expanding in power, largely through the process of industrialization. These countries seeking to attain great power status were: Italy after the Risorgimento, Japan after the Meiji Restoration, and the United States after its civil war. By the dawn of the 20th century, the balance of world power had changed substantially since the Congress of Vienna.

France and the United Kingdom maintained technologically advanced armed forces with power projection capabilities and maintain large defence budgets to this day. Yet, as the Cold War continued, authorities began to question if France and the United Kingdom could retain their long-held statuses as great powers. China, with the world's largest population, has slowly risen to great power status, with large growth in economic and military power in the post-war period. After 1949, the Republic of China began to lose its recognition as the sole legitimate government of China by the other great powers, in favour of the People's Republic of China. Subsequently, in 1971, it lost its permanent seat at the UN Security Council to the People's Republic of China.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the cold war, what European powers rebuilt their ecomonies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Kingdom, France, and West Germany </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year was China beginning to lose its hold as sole legitimate government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did China lose its permanent seat at UN security council?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Joshua Baron – a &quot;researcher, lecturer, and consultant on international conflict&quot; – since the early 1960s direct military conflicts and major confrontations have &quot;receded into the background&quot; with regards to relations among the great powers. Baron argues several reasons why this is the case, citing the unprecedented rise of the United States and its predominant position as the key reason. Baron highlights that since World War Two no other great power has been able to achieve parity or near parity with the United States, with the exception of the Soviet Union for a brief time. This position is unique among the great powers since the start of the modern era (the 16th century), where there has traditionally always been &quot;tremendous parity among the great powers&quot;. This unique period of American primacy has been an important factor in maintaining a condition of peace between the great powers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Since what time has military conflicts receded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country has risen above other superpowers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Since what century has there always been parity in powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> modern era (the 16th century)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's primacy has factored into maintaining peace among powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another important factor is the apparent consensus among Western great powers that military force is no longer an effective tool of resolving disputes among their peers.
