In February 1984, according to the film director Sir Richard Attenborough, Madonna auditioned at the Royale Theatre on Broadway for a dance role in his movie version of A Chorus Line using her birth-name of Ciccone, but he rejected her.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Madonna was criticized for her performance of which song in the VMA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Madonna wearing during the performance of &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; at the VMA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a wedding dress </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Her video of &quot;Material Girl&quot; was an imitation of which singer's song, &quot;Diamonds are a girl's best friend?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marilyn Monroe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Madonna married Sean Penn?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on her birthday in 1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Madonna audition for a dance role in the show &quot;A Chorus Line?&quot; </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 1984</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Madonna entered mainstream films in February 1985, beginning with a brief appearance as a club singer in Vision Quest, a romantic drama film. Its soundtrack contained two new singles, her U.S. number-one single, &quot;Crazy for You&quot; and &quot;Gambler&quot;. She also appeared in the comedy Desperately Seeking Susan in March 1985, a film which introduced the song &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, her first number one single in the United Kingdom. Although Madonna was not the lead actress for the film, her profile was such that the movie widely became considered (and marketed) as a Madonna vehicle. The New York Times film critic Vincent Canby named it one of the ten best films of 1985.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Madonna enter mainstream films?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the romantic drama film that Madonna starred in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Vision Quest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Madonna appear in the comedy Desperately Seeking Susan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Madonna's two new singles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Crazy for You&quot; and &quot;Gambler&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song did the comedy Desperately Seeking Susan promote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Into the Groove&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beginning in April 1985, Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America, The Virgin Tour, with the Beastie Boys as her opening act.

In July, Penthouse and Playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna, taken in New York in 1978. She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time, and was paid as little as $25 a session. The publication of the photos caused a media uproar, but Madonna remained &quot;unapologetic and defiant&quot;. The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $100,000. She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert, saying that she would not take her jacket off because &quot;[the media] might hold it against me ten years from now.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Madonna's first concert tour in North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beginning in April 1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the opening act for Madonna's concert The Virgin tour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Beastie Boys </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Madonna have nude photos taken of her in New York?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1978</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was Madonna's nude photos were finally sold for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up to $100,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Live Aid Charity Concert held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1985</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In June 1986, Madonna released her third studio album, True Blue, which was inspired by and dedicated to Sean Penn.

The album topped the charts in over 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time, and became her best-selling studio album of her career to this date with sales of 25 million.

In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted her song &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;. The corresponding music video featured many Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning, and a dream of making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products. Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract. The song was included on Madonna's fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, which was co-written and co-produced by Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray. Madonna received positive feedback for the album, with Rolling Stone writing that it was &quot;as close to art as pop music gets&quot;. Like a Prayer peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 15 million copies worldwide, with 4 million copies sold in the U.S. alone. Six singles were released from the album, including &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, which reached number one, and &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and &quot;Cherish&quot;, both peaking at number two.

It also featured the US number-one hit &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, which earned songwriter Stephen Sondheim an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1991. While shooting the film, Madonna began a relationship with Beatty, which dissolved by the end of 1990. In April 1990, Madonna began her Blond Ambition World Tour, which was held until August. Rolling Stone called it an &quot;elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza&quot; and proclaimed it &quot;the best tour of 1990&quot;. The tour generated strong negative reaction from religious groups for her performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation. In response, Madonna said, &quot;The tour in no way hurts anybody's sentiments. It's for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others&quot;. The Laserdisc release of the tour won Madonna a Grammy Award in 1992 for Best Long Form Music Video.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the film Dick Tracy, who did Madonna starred as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Breathless Mahoney</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Madonna's role in Dick Tracy led to which award nomination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saturn Award</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who earned an Academy Award for the song &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Sooner or Later?&quot; </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stephen Sondheim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Madonna and Beatty's relationship end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">end of 1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Madonna have a relationship with while shooting the film?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beatty</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Immaculate Collection, Madonna's first greatest-hits compilation album, was released in November 1990.

Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network.

She recorded the film's theme song, &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot;, which became a Hot 100 number one hit. The same year, she founded her own entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60 million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. The first release from the venture was Madonna's book, titled Sex. It consisted of sexually provocative and explicit images, photographed by Steven Meisel. The book received strong negative reaction from the media and the general public, but sold 1.5 million copies at $50 each in a matter of days. At the same time she released her fifth studio album, Erotica, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. Its title track peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Erotica also produced five singles: &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;. Madonna had provocative imagery featured in the erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics. She also starred in the film Dangerous Game, which was released straight to video in North America.

With her sixth studio album, Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and produced four singles, including &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks, the longest period of any Madonna single.

Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, Madonna gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: &quot;Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public.&quot; Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997; she declared that they were &quot;better off as best friends.&quot; After Lourdes' birth, Madonna became involved in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah.

She released her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: &quot;I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that &quot;Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light.&quot; The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number one &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, and &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;. The music video of &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the film that Madonna starred in 2000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Next Best Thing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the film's soundtrack called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Time Stood Still</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Madonna's eighth album called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was &quot;Music&quot; released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many albums did &quot;Music&quot; sell in the first 10 days?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four million </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>She met director Guy Ritchie, who would become her second husband, in November 1998 and gave birth to their son Rocco John Ritchie on August 11, 2000 in Los Angeles.

She commented, &quot;[American Life] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me.&quot; Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that &quot;American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent&quot; while condemning it as &quot;a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously.&quot; The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq.

Ultimately, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008. She decided to adopt from Malawi. The country's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo &quot;Mercy&quot; James; however, the application was rejected because Madonna was not a resident of the country. Madonna appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James. She also released Celebration, her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner. It contained the new songs &quot;Celebration&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; along with 34 hits spanning her career. Celebration reached number one in the UK, tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo act with most number one albums in the British chart history.

Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of &quot;Find a winning formula and stick to it.&quot; Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that &quot;having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing.&quot; Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that &quot;Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries.

I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'.&quot; Mark Kamins, her first producer, believed that Madonna is &quot;a much underrated musician and lyricist.&quot; Rolling Stone has named her &quot;an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.&quot; According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing &quot;incredible&quot; hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single &quot;Into the Groove&quot; and its line &quot;Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine.&quot; Madonna's songwriting are often autobiographical over the years, dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment. Her songs also speak about taboo and unconventional issues of their period, such as sexuality and AIDS on Erotica (1992). Many of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which lead to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame twice, for 2014 and 2016 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the &quot;100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who writes and creates most of her own music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Madonna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Madonna's first producer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mark Kamins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose music speak about taboo and unconventional subjects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Madonna was nominated to be inducted twice which year to the Songwriter Hall of Fame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2014 and 2016</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which magazine stated that Madonna was the greatest songwriter of all time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Rolling Stone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before emerging as a pop star, Madonna has spent her early years in rock music alongside her bands, Breakfast Club and Emmy. While performing with Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period. Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album Pre-Madonna. Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the '80's, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished arrangements and Madonna's own vocal style. Her second album, Like a Virgin (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works (pizzicato synthesizer line that opens &quot;Angel&quot;); potential negative reaction from social groups (&quot;Dress You Up&quot; was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center); and retro styles (&quot;Shoo-Bee-Doo&quot;, Madonna's homage to Motown).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which genre did Madonna started out in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rock music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When performing with Emmy, how many songs did Madonna produce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12-14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who popularize dance music as mainstream music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Madonna's second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Like a Virgin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Her mature artistic statement was visible in True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer (1989). In True Blue, she incorporated classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music. Like a Prayer introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, funk, R&amp;B and gospel music. Her versatility was further shown on I'm Breathless, which consists predominantly of the 1940s Broadway showtune-flavoured jazz, swing and big band tracks. Madonna continued to compose ballads and uptempo dance songs for Erotica (1992) and Bedtime Stories (1994). Both albums explored element of new jack swing, with Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly saying that &quot;she could actually be viewed as new jack swing's godmother.&quot; She tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and hip hop into her music. With Ray of Light, Madonna brought electronic music from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which 2 album show Madonna's artistic statement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer (1989)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">True Blue has what type of music Incorporated in it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which 2 albums explored the New Lack Swing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Erotica (1992) and Bedtime Stories (1994)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Madonna brought which type of music to mainstream with Ray of Light?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> electronic music </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Madonna experimented with more folk and acoustic music in Music (2000) and American Life (2003). A change was noted in the content of the songs in Music, with most of them being simple love songs, but with an underlying tone of melancholy. According to Q magazine, American Life was characterized by &quot;a thumping techno rhythm, liquid keyboard lines, an acoustic chorus and a bizarre Madonna rap.&quot; The &quot;conventional rock songs&quot; of the album were suffused with dramatic lyrics about patriotism and composition, including the appearance of a gospel choir in the song &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;. Madonna returned to pure dance songs with Confessions on a Dance Floor, infusing club beats and retro music with the lyrics about paradoxical metaphors and reference to her earlier works. Madonna moved to urban direction with Hard Candy (2008), mixing R&amp;B and hip hop music with dance tunes.

Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her &quot;the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs&quot;, despite not being a &quot;heavyweight talent.&quot; According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, &quot;Madonna's vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs &quot;straight,&quot; but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.&quot; Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as &quot;Minnie Mouse on helium&quot;. During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, &quot;I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using.

She learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy in the late 1970s before joining the Breakfast Club line-up as the drummer. This helped her to form the band Emmy, where she performed as the guitarist and lead vocalist. Madonna later played guitar on her demo recordings. On the liner notes of Pre-Madonna, Stephen Bray wrote: &quot;I've always thought she passed up a brilliant career as a rhythm guitarist.&quot; After her career breakthrough, Madonna focused mainly in singing but was also credited for playing cowbell on Madonna (1983) and synthesizer on Like a Prayer (1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart, before eventually leaving the project. After two decades, Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music (2000). She took further lessons from guitarist Monte Pittman to improve her guitar skill. Since then Madonna has played guitar on every tour, as well as her studio albums. At the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards, she received nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award, which honors the most promising up-and-coming guitarist.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which instruments can Madonna play?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drum and guitar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who taught Madonna how to play the drum and guitar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dan Gilroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instrument does Madonna play on her demo recordings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">guitar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Madonna spent learning to play the violin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the guitarist that Madonna learnt from to improve on her skills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Monte Pittman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Taraborrelli, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother. Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that &quot;some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them.&quot; Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important even than the death of her mother: &quot;It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to who was the defining moment of Madonna's childhood with her mother's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Taraborrelli,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which psychiatrist said that when a parent dies when the child is young, it leaves a lasting impact?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Keith Ablow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believes that the rape Madonna experienced is the driving force in life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lucy O'Brien</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As they grew older Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: &quot;We were all wounded in one way or another by [her death], and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself.&quot; Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. &quot;Her death had taught [Madonna] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who felt deep sadness as the death of their mother fades away?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna and her sisters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does Madonna's mum resemble?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poet Anne Sexton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Madonna's favorite poet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sylvia Plath</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who felt that her mother death was the driving force behind her success?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin'&quot; by Nancy Sinatra; she said it summed up her own &quot;take-charge attitude&quot;.

She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film Who's That Girl.

Author Douglas Kellner noted, &quot;such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences.&quot; Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What influence did Madonna music video reflects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American and Hispanic mixed street style</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">She transmit her avant garde style to which audience?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American audience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which look of Madonna became a fashion trend?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spanish look</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of Spanish clothings were worn for the video La Ista Bonita?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">boleros and layered skirts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.

He added, &quot;Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing.&quot; Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by &quot;stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe ...

Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the &quot;Madonna mic&quot;. Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes. Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. Thus her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized. Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are deemed as &quot;extravagant show piece, a walking art show.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Madonna use in her concerts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the microphone coined as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Madonna mic&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is first to have reenactment of her music videos in concerts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose concerts are extravagant live shows?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna's</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Various music journalists, critical theorists, and authors have deemed Madonna the most influential female recording artist of all time.

As Roger Chapman documents in Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices, Volume 1 (2010), she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations, social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit, sexual imagery and lyrics, religious symbolism, and otherwise &quot;irreverent&quot; behavior in her live performances. The Times wrote that she had &quot;started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.&quot; Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one's social relations. In Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture (2009), the authors noted that Madonna, as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, Madonna represents woman's occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women.
