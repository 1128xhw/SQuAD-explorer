It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: Antiquity, Medieval period, and Modern period. The Medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, the High, and the Late Middle Ages.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Middle Ages begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century saw the end of the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event marked the beginning of the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the collapse of the Western Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Renaissance, what era occurred at the end of the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Age of Discovery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the first period of the three that Western history is traditionally divided into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antiquity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Depopulation, deurbanisation, invasion, and movement of peoples, which had begun in Late Antiquity, continued in the Early Middle Ages. The barbarian invaders, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East—once part of the Eastern Roman Empire—came under the rule of the Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with Antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire survived in the east and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Code of Justinian, was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th century. It covered much of Western Europe, but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions—Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the movement of peoples, invasion and depopulation, what event started in Late Antiquity and continued into the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deurbanisation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what state did barbarian invaders establish kingdoms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Western Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What empire was North Africa previously a part of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Eastern Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Caliphate conquer North Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Italians discover the Code of Justinian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1070 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from the Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the architecture of Gothic cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period, and into the Late Middle Ages.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year marked the beginning of the High Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event led to larger crop yields in the High Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Medieval Warm Period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the economic system that organized peasants into villages owing labor and rent to nobles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manorialism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the political system that gave rents to knights in return for military service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">feudalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Crusades begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1095</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans.

When referring to their own times, they spoke of them as being &quot;modern&quot;. In the 1330s, the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (or &quot;ancient&quot;) and to the Christian period as nova (or &quot;new&quot;). Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch's time, and therefore added a third period to Petrarch's two. The &quot;Middle Ages&quot; first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or &quot;middle season&quot;. In early usage, there were many variants, including medium aevum, or &quot;middle age&quot;, first recorded in 1604, and media saecula, or &quot;middle ages&quot;, first recorded in 1625. The alternative term &quot;medieval&quot; (or occasionally &quot;mediaeval&quot;) derives from medium aevum. Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th century historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Six Ages, what other scheme did writers in the Middle Ages use to divide history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Four Empires</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What writer referred to the Christian period as new?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Petrarch </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the History of the Florentine People?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leonardo Bruni</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the History of the Florentine People published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1442</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first divided history into the ancient, medieval and modern periods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christoph Cellarius</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is 476, first used by Bruni.[A] For Europe as a whole, 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages, but there is no universally agreed upon end date. Depending on the context, events such as Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the Americas in 1492, the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used. English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period. For Spain, dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516, the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504, or the conquest of Granada in 1492. Historians from Romance-speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: an earlier &quot;High&quot; and later &quot;Low&quot; period. English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts, generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals: &quot;Early&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, and &quot;Late&quot;. In the 19th century, the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;,[B] but with the adoption of these subdivisions, use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages, at least among historians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date is usually given as the beginning of the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">476</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first writer to date the Middle Ages from 476?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bruni</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is the Middle Ages generally considered to have ended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1500 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Turks conquer Constantinople?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1453</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Ferdinand II die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1516</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Roman Empire achieve its greatest extent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 2nd century AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the revival of Persia occur under the Sassanids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3rd century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the size of the Roman army increase in the 3rd century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">doubled </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the need for increased revenue to pay for the Roman army lead to an increase in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">taxes </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for the Roman landowning class?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">curial</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other.[C] In 330, after a period of civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns. Another change was the Christianisation, or conversion of the empire to Christianity, a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Diocletian begin his reign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">284</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Roman Empire split into western and eastern administrative divisions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">286</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the city previously located on the site of Constantinople?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantium </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what century was the Roman conversion to Christianity considered complete?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the rule of Constantine end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">337</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 376, the Ostrogoths, fleeing from the Huns, received permission from Emperor Valens (r. 364–378) to settle in the Roman province of Thracia in the Balkans. The settlement did not go smoothly, and when Roman officials mishandled the situation, the Ostrogoths began to raid and plunder.[D] Valens, attempting to put down the disorder, was killed fighting the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378. As well as the threat from such tribal confederacies from the north, internal divisions within the empire, especially within the Christian Church, caused problems. In 400, the Visigoths invaded the Western Roman Empire and, although briefly forced back from Italy, in 410 sacked the city of Rome. In 406 the Alans, Vandals, and Suevi crossed into Gaul; over the next three years they spread across Gaul and in 409 crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into modern-day Spain. The Migration Period began, where various people, initially largely Germanic peoples, moved across Europe. The Franks, Alemanni, and the Burgundians all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes settled in Britain. In the 430s the Huns began invading the empire; their king Attila (r. 434–453) led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447, Gaul in 451, and Italy in 452. The Hunnic threat remained until Attila's death in 453, when the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart. These invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the Western Roman Empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Ostrogoths settle in the Roman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">376</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invited the Ostrogoths to settle in the Roman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Valens </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what province did the Ostrogoths settle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thracia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what battle was the Emperor Valens killed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Adrianople</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Battle of Adrianople occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9 August 378</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the end of the 5th century the western section of the empire was divided into smaller political units, ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century. The deposition of the last emperor of the west, Romulus Augustus, in 476 has traditionally marked the end of the Western Roman Empire.[E] The Eastern Roman Empire, often referred to as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart, had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories. The Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory, but none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west, Byzantine control of most of the Western Empire could not be sustained; the reconquest of the Italian peninsula and Mediterranean periphery by Justinian (r. 527–565) was the sole, and temporary, exception.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the last Western Roman Emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romulus Augustus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the reign of the last Western Roman Emperor end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">476 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for the Eastern Roman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantine Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Eastern Roman Emperor reconquered Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Justinian </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Justinian's reign end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">565</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as &quot;invasions&quot;, they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed. Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms.

The Ostrogoths settled in Italy in the late 5th century under Theoderic (d. 526) and set up a kingdom marked by its co-operation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths, at least until the last years of Theodoric's reign. The Burgundians settled in Gaul, and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the Huns in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s. Between today's Geneva and Lyon, it grew to become the realm of Burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In northern Gaul, the Franks and Britons set up small polities. The Frankish Kingdom was centred in north-eastern Gaul, and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric (d. 481).[G] Under Childeric's son Clovis (r. 509–511), the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity. Britons, related to the natives of Britannia — modern-day Great Britain — settled in what is now Brittany.[H] Other monarchies were established by the Visigoths in Iberia, the Suevi in north-western Iberia, and the Vandals in North Africa. In the 6th century, the Lombards settled in northern Italy, replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all. By the late 6th century this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Ostrogoths arrive in Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Ostrogothic leader led his people into Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Theoderic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who destroyed the Burgundian kingdom in 436?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Huns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what part of Europe did the Burgundians settle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gaul</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first notable king of the Franks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Childeric </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The invasions brought new ethnic groups to Europe, although some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others.

The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on, but distinct from, Latin, collectively known as Romance languages. These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries.

There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests. At the emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of most of Italy, North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the economic revival in the Eastern Roman Empire end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century was there peace with one of Rome's traditional enemies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did most of the invasion in the Eastern Roman Empire take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Balkans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year saw the completion of the Theodosian Code?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">438</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Emperor when the Corpus Juris Civilis was compiled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Justinian </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Eastern Empire the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs added a further difficulty for Justinian's successors. It began gradually, but by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in Thrace and Illyrium, and had defeated an imperial army near Adrianople in 551. In the 560s the Avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the Danube; by the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the eastern emperors to pay tribute. They remained a strong power until 796. An additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute. This led to a period of peace, but when Maurice was overthrown, the Persians invaded and during the reign of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) controlled large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, until Heraclius' successful counterattack. In 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who defeated the Eastern Roman Empire near Adrianople in 551?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Slavic tribes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What tribe received tribute from the Eastern Roman emperors in the 6th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Avars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Near what river were the Avars originally based?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Danube</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the reign of what Emperor did the Persians occupy Egypt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heraclius </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the reign of Maurice end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">602</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Western Europe, some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with Church than secular affairs. Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What author would Jerome rather read than the Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cicero </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Jerome die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">420</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did Gregory of Tours live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with art, how was religious instruction commonly received in the late 6th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">music </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the death of Sidonius Apollinaris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">489</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Changes also took place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces.[I] Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the focus of aristocratic culture during this period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">great feasts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with gold, what luxury was present on the clothes of the elite?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jewels </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with loyalty and honor, what virtue did the elite value?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">courage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what society did women have status as abbesses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anglo-Saxon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country did Gregory of Tours live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Merovingian Gaul</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people might live in a large peasant settlement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">700 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a way in which a free peasant might become an aristocrat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military service</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did written records of peasant life begin to appear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with aristocratic writers, where do contemporary written descriptions of peasants come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">law codes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What field produces most of the finding about peasants from this era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">archaeology</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages.

Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use. In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals. Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity.

All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. 632). After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later 7th century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711.

Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the Aghlabids controlled North Africa, and the Tulunids became rulers of Egypt.

The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope Gregory the Great (pope 590–604) survived, and of those more than 850 letters, the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent. Under such monks as Columba (d. 597) and Columbanus (d. 615), they founded monasteries, taught in Latin and Greek, and authored secular and religious works.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Gregory the Great become pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">590</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many of Gregory's letters were concerned with Constantinople or Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">850 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what region of Western Europe did the pope have influence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Gregorian mission travel to Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">597 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Columbanus die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">615</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of monasticism in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called cenobitism, which was pioneered by Pachomius (d. 348) in the 4th century. Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the Life of Anthony. Benedict of Nursia (d. 547) wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century, detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot. Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages, in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families, centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions, and bases for missions and proselytisation. They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages. Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, written by authors such as Bede (d. 735), a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religious lifestyle arose in the Early Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monasticism </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the pioneer of cenobitism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pachomius </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who composed the Benedictine Rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benedict of Nursia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what part of England did Bede come?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">northern </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of the leader of a monastery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abbot</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries, all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, who were descended from Clovis. The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria. Such warfare was exploited by Pippin (d. 640), the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne. Later members of his family inherited the office, acting as advisers and regents. One of his descendants, Charles Martel (d. 741), won the Battle of Poitiers in 732, halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees.[K] Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, and East Anglia, which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders. Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts. Ireland was divided into even smaller political units, usually known as tribal kingdoms, under the control of kings. There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland, of varying importance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Austrasia and Neustria, what kingdom was originally part of the Frankish kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burgundy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty ruled Neustria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Merovingian </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From whom did the rulers of the Merovingian dynasty trace their ancestry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Clovis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of Pippin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mayor of the Palace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What leader was victorious at the Battle of Poitiers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Martel</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Carolingian dynasty, as the successors to Charles Martel are known, officially took control of the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria in a coup of 753 led by Pippin III (r. 752–768). A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought, and gained, authority for this coup from Pope Stephen II (pope 752–757). Pippin's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers, exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel, and circulated stories of the family's great piety. At the time of his death in 768, Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons, Charles (r. 768–814) and Carloman (r. 768–771). When Carloman died of natural causes, Charles blocked the succession of Carloman's young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria. Charles, more often known as Charles the Great or Charlemagne, embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe, eventually controlling modern-day France, northern Italy, and Saxony. In the wars that lasted beyond 800, he rewarded allies with war booty and command over parcels of land. In 774, Charlemagne conquered the Lombards, which freed the papacy from the fear of Lombard conquest and marked the beginnings of the Papal States.[L]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty consisted of descendants of Charles Martel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carolingian </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Carolingians take over Neustria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">753 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the coup that gained control over Austrasia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pippin III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Stephen II become pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">752</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Charles, who was the son of Pippin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carloman </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Charlemagne assume the imperial title?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christmas Day 800</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what class were most inhabitants of the Carolingian Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peasants </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many counts existed in the Carolingian Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">300 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what settlements did most inhabitants of the Carolingian Empire live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small farms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the British Isles, with what land did the Carolingians trade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scandinavia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Charlemagne's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the &quot;Carolingian Renaissance&quot;.

The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery—or writing office—made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Charlemagne's court based?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aachen </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the cultural revival associated with Charlemagne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carolingian Renaissance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what ethnicity was Alcuin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Alcuin die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">804</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Latin of Charlemagne's era later known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Medieval Latin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813.

Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia.

By the middle of the 10th century, Alfred's successors had conquered Northumbria, and restored English control over most of the southern part of Great Britain. In northern Britain, Kenneth MacAlpin (d. c. 860) united the Picts and the Scots into the Kingdom of Alba. In the early 10th century, the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany, and was engaged in driving back the Magyars. Its efforts culminated in the coronation in 962 of Otto I (r. 936–973) as Holy Roman Emperor.

By the late 10th century Italy had been drawn into the Ottonian sphere after a period of instability; Otto III (r. 996–1002) spent much of his later reign in the kingdom.

Commerce revived and the emperors oversaw the extension of a uniform administration to all the provinces. The military was reorganised, which allowed the emperors John I (r. 969–976) and Basil II (r. 976–1025) to expand the frontiers of the empire on all fronts. The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical learning, a process known as the Macedonian Renaissance. Writers such as John Geometres (fl. early 10th century) composed new hymns, poems, and other works. Missionary efforts by both eastern and western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians, Bulgars, Bohemians, Poles, Magyars, and Slavic inhabitants of the Kievan Rus'. These conversions contributed to the founding of political states in the lands of those peoples—the states of Moravia, Bulgaria, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kievan Rus'. Bulgaria, which was founded around 680, at its height reached from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River in modern Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea. By 1018, the last Bulgarian nobles had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what dynasty was Leo VI a member?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Macedonian </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what period did Constantine VII reign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">913–959</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Basil I's rule begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">867</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what century did John Geometres flourish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In approximately what year was Bulgaria founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">680</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Few large stone buildings were constructed between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the 8th century, although many smaller ones were built during the 6th and 7th centuries.

The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the primary military arm of Anglo-Saxon armies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infantry </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What military arm did the Visigoths have a large amount of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cavalry </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Scythian weapon was used during this era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">composite bow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What weapon replaced the Scythian composite bow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hunnic composite bow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with lamellar armor, what armor replaced scale armor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mail</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court, and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine territory. There are survivals from the large brooches in fibula or penannular form that were a key piece of personal adornment for elites, including the Irish Tara Brooch. Highly decorated books were mostly Gospel Books and these have survived in larger numbers, including the Insular Book of Kells, the Book of Lindisfarne, and the imperial Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which is one of the few to retain its &quot;treasure binding&quot; of gold encrusted with jewels. Charlemagne's court seems to have been responsible for the acceptance of figurative monumental sculpture in Christian art, and by the end of the period near life-sized figures such as the Gero Cross were common in important churches.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with carved ivories, what religious works of the Early Middle Ages were common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> illuminated manuscripts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a notable cross made during this era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Cross of Lothair</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was a notable hoard found near the former lands of the Byzantine Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nagyszentmiklós </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a notable decorated book with a binding of jewel-encrusted gold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was a hoard from Visigothic Spain found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guarrazar </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry.

One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies, known as the fyrd, which were led by the local elites. In military technology, one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow, which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during the last part of the Early Middle Ages.

The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of assarting, or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the approximate population of Europe in 1347?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many millions of people lived in Europe in the year 1000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the High Middle Ages, what percentage of the European population consisted of rural peasants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with manors, where did peasants in the High Middle Ages often live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">villages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the term for the practice of giving incentives to peasants to cultivate new lands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">assarting</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Other sections of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled nobility and simple knights, exploited the manors and the peasants, although they did not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to be considered hereditary, and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son.[R] The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions.[S] Castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords. Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles. Beneath them, lesser nobles had authority over smaller areas of land and fewer people. Knights were the lowest level of nobility; they controlled but did not own land, and had to serve other nobles.[T]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what centuries did fiefs become hereditary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11th and 12th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In this period, who usually inherited fiefs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the eldest son</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were castles originally built out of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wood </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group constituted the lowest nobility?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Knights </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century were castles first built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9th </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The clergy was divided into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks.

Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded.

Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs.

In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sea were the Hanseatic cities located on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baltic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Venice and Pisa, what was a notable Italian maritime republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genoa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote The Travels of Marco Polo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marco Polo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What accounting method was utilized in this period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">double-entry bookkeeping</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what region was gold coinage first reintroduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italy </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The High Middle Ages was the formative period in the history of the modern Western state.

This led to dissension among the English nobility, while John's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215 to Magna Carta, a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in England. Under Henry III (r. 1216–72), John's son, further concessions were made to the nobility, and royal power was diminished. The French monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries, bringing more territories within the kingdom under their personal rule and centralising the royal administration. Under Louis IX (r. 1226–70), royal prestige rose to new heights as Louis served as a mediator for most of Europe.[Y]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Duke of Normandy in 1066?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William the Conqueror</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what period did William reign over England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1066–87</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Robert Guiscard die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1085</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kingdom grew out of the duchy founded by Robert Guiscard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kingdom of Sicily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what dynasty did Henry II belong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Angevin </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Iberia, the Christian states, which had been confined to the north-western part of the peninsula, began to push back against the Islamic states in the south, a period known as the Reconquista.

Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states, initially under the Caliphate of Córdoba, which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas, who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate re-established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s.

The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor, which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland. Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat, they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive. The Turks also had difficulties, losing control of Jerusalem to the Fatimids of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars.

Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction.

Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of Aristotle and his emphasis on empiricism and rationalism. Scholars such as Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and Peter Lombard (d. 1164) introduced Aristotelian logic into theology. In the late 11th and early 12th centuries cathedral schools spread throughout Western Europe, signalling the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns. Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by the universities established in major European cities. Philosophy and theology fused in scholasticism, an attempt by 12th- and 13th-century scholars to reconcile authoritative texts, most notably Aristotle and the Bible. This movement tried to employ a systemic approach to truth and reason and culminated in the thought of Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), who wrote the Summa Theologica, or Summary of Theology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group opposed the nominalists on the subject of universals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">realists </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ancient philosopher was rediscovered, leading to a revival of philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aristotle </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Peter Lombard die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1164</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the school of thought that combined theology and philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scholasticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who authored the Summa Theologica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Aquinas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chivalry and the ethos of courtly love developed in royal and noble courts.

Where available, Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials. From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque, the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form. Just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe. Romanesque buildings have massive stone walls, openings topped by semi-circular arches, small windows, and, particularly in France, arched stone vaults. The large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of façades, especially in France, and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals. According to art historian C. R. Dodwell, &quot;virtually all the churches in the West were decorated with wall-paintings&quot;, of which few survive. Simultaneous with the development in church architecture, the distinctive European form of the castle was developed, and became crucial to politics and warfare.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century was Romanesque architecture first used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What feature of Romanesque architecture was especially prevalent in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arched stone vaults</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who noted the prevalence of wall-paintings in Western churches of this era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">C.

This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities.

These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an Apostolic life.

Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions.[AD] Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Black Death start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1347 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many million people died from the Black Death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What popular uprising occurred in France during this period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the jacquerie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What English popular revolt took place during this period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Peasants' Revolt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Italian city experienced a popular revolt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Florence </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Society throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death. Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period. Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death.

They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327–77) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Hundred Years' War begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1337 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nickname of Edward III's son Edward?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Black Prince</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the reign of Edward III begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1327</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Poitiers, what was the site of a notable victory by Edward III's England over the French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Crécy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade saw the victories of Joan of Arc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1420s </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In modern-day Germany, the Holy Roman Empire continued to rule, but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form.

After losing the Hundred Years' War, England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor (r. 1485–1509 as Henry VII) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III (r. 1483–85) at Bosworth in 1485. In Scandinavia, Margaret I of Denmark (r. in Denmark 1387–1412) consolidated Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar, which continued until 1523. The major power around the Baltic Sea was the Hanseatic League, a commercial confederation of city states that traded from Western Europe to Russia. Scotland emerged from English domination under Robert the Bruce (r. 1306–29), who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Poland and Hungary, what Eastern European state grew in power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bohemia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what century did Portugal devote itself to overseas expansion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nation lost the Hundred Years' War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the regnal name of Henry Tudor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry VII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Denmark and Sweden, what country was part of the Union of Kalmar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Norway</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although the Palaeologi emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261, they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Emperors from what dynasty recaptured Constantinople in 1261?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palaeologi </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Second Bulgarian Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, what polity controlled the former Byzantine Balkan lands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Venice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What tribe of Turks emerged in 13th century Anatolia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ottomans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Bulgaria become a vassal of the Ottomans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1366 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was defeated at the Battle of Kosovo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Serbia </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the tumultuous 14th century, disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the Avignon Papacy of 1305–78, also called the &quot;Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy&quot; (a reference to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews), and then to the Great Schism, lasting from 1378 to 1418, when there were two and later three rival popes, each supported by several states.

Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what nationality was John Wycliffe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Wycliffe declared a heretic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1415 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Wycliffe believe should read the Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the laity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Bohemian movement was influenced by Wycliffe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hussitism </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Jan Hus die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">burned at the stake</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The papacy further refined the practice in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist.

Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the Late Middle Ages, who was allowed to drink wine at Mass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the clergy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Thomas à Kempis die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1471</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Church condemn witches?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1484 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Malleus Maleficarum published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1486 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Malleus Maleficarum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">handbook for witch-hunters</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Later Middle Ages, theologians such as John Duns Scotus (d. 1308)[AH] and William of Ockham (d. c. 1348), led a reaction against scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith.

Much literature remained religious in character, and although a great deal of it continued to be written in Latin, a new demand developed for saints' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages. This was fed by the growth of the Devotio Moderna movement, most prominently in the formation of the Brethren of the Common Life, but also in the works of German mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler (d. 1361).

These objects also included the Hispano-Moresque ware produced by mostly Mudéjar potters in Spain. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for the Royal Gold Cup.

Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small woodcuts, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century.

Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world; Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith, and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Renaissance, during what period were the Middle Ages disparaged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Enlightenment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What era did Renaissance scholars negatively compare the Middle Ages to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Classical world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did scholars of the Enlightenment see the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as a time of ignorance and superstition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Enlightenment scholars consider to be inferior to reason?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">faith</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages. Science historian Edward Grant writes, &quot;If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century], they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities&quot;. Also, contrary to common belief, David Lindberg writes, &quot;the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Edward Grant a historian of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Science </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who argued that scholars in the Middle Ages were rarely coerced by the Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Lindberg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Grant, the medieval use of reason was the forerunner the revolutionary rationalism of what century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century and still very common, is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat. This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere. Lindberg and Ronald Numbers, another scholar of the period, state that there &quot;was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference&quot;. Other misconceptions such as &quot;the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages&quot;, &quot;the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science&quot;, or &quot;the medieval Christian church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy&quot;, are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by current historical research.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what century was it first proposed that people in the Middle Ages thought the Earth was flat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with autopsies, what is it erroneously believed that the medieval Church forbade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dissections </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to a misconception, what did the rise of Christianity destroy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ancient science</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to another misconception, what field of study was the medieval Church opposed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural philosophy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Lindberg, who is a notable scholar of the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ronald Numbers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
