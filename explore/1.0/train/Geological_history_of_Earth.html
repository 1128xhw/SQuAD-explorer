The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years. The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it.

The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity.

In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere.

Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (&quot;continental climate&quot;) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns.

The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup. Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in Western Europe, where the Triassic was first studied. In North America, for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ocean name is translated to mean &quot;all the sea?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Panthalassa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process obscures information aboutt he ocean during the Triassic period from inspection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subduction of oceanic plates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was occurring to Pangaea in the late Triassic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pangaea was rifting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which sediements in the US are an indication of the break up of Pangaea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Newark Supergroup</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of terrestrial animals are found from the Triassic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">terrestrial vertebrates</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what years was the Jurassic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which supercontinent came apart in the Jurassic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pangaea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Gulf of Mexico formed in the rift between North America and what other land mass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what point did the South Atlantic ocean begin to open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cretaceous Period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which late Jurassic cultural sites are famous in Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Cretaceous, the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time.

The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation.

Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres (115 ft) in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres (591 ft) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont, Quebec, Ontario and Michigan. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea, including much of Finland. The region continues to rise, still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe.
