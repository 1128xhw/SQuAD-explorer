The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New York</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many acres of land did Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen purchase in 1836?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6,642</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the reason the Allen brothers purchased land in 1836?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> founding a city</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Allen brothers name the city they founded after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sam Houston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Sam Houston elected President of Texas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1836</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought land along Buffalo Bayou to build a city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Allen brothers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much land did the Allen brothers buy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 6,642 acres </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After which famous general was the city named?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sam Houston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1860 what percentage of the city's population was slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">forty-nine percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the slave population of Houston increase from 1850 to 1860?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tripled</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of non-discrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event cause shipping activities to be suspended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were built due to the demand for what items during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> petroleum and synthetic rubber products</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Ellington Field built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> during World War I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Brown Shipbuilding Company founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1942</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the policy created by President Roosevelt due to the boom in defense jobs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-discrimination for defense contractors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of refineries were built along the Houston ship channel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Petrochemical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To fill what type of demand were refineries built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">petroleum and synthetic rubber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What world event caused this increased need for petrochemicals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did thousands of new workers flock to Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">defense jobs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which president created a policy of non-discrimination for defense contractors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President Roosevelt </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid-1980s, as oil prices fell precipitously.

In the late 1980s, the city's economy suffered from the nationwide recession. After the early 1990s recession, Houston made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care/biotechnology, and reduced its dependence on the petroleum industry.

The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What materials are underpinning the land surface of Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Houston's geology was formed from river deposits from the erosion of what mountains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rocky Mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The sand and clay deposited onto decaying marine matter transformed into what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oil and natural gas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is halite?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a rock salt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of farming is Houston's surface soil good for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rice farming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides sands, what are the foundations of Houston's land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">clays</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How deep are the clay and sands foundations of Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several miles </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What geological event caused the foundations of the land beneath Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">erosion of the Rocky Mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What agricultural crop was farmed in the rich soils on the outlying areas of Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the decaying organics under the clay and sand deposits later form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oil and natural gas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1960s, Downtown Houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office structures.

Hines—culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, 1,002-foot (305 m)-tall JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, 15th tallest building in the United States, and the 85th tallest skyscraper in the world, based on highest architectural feature. In 1983, the 71-floor, 992-foot (302 m)-tall Wells Fargo Plaza (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, becoming the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest architectural feature, it is the 17th tallest in the United States and the 95th tallest in the world.

Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves.

The only other major publication to serve the city is the Houston Press—a free alternative weekly with a weekly readership of more than 300,000.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Houston's major newspaper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Houston Chronicle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who owns the Houston Chronicle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Hearst Corporation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chronicle rival newspaper, the Houston Post, cease operations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1995</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose family owned the Houston Post?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Bill Hobby</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the other newspaper that serves Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Houston Press</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Houston's highway system has a hub-and-spoke freeway structure serviced by multiple loops. The innermost loop is Interstate 610, which encircles downtown, the medical center, and many core neighborhoods with around a 8-mile (13 km) diameter. Beltway 8 and its freeway core, the Sam Houston Tollway, form the middle loop at a diameter of roughly 23 miles (37 km). A proposed highway project, State Highway 99 (Grand Parkway), will form a third loop outside of Houston, totaling 180 miles in length and making an almost-complete circumference, with the exception of crossing the ship channel. As of June 2014, two of eleven segments of State Highway 99 have been completed to the west of Houston, and three northern segments, totaling 38 miles, are actively under construction and scheduled to open to traffic late in 2015. In addition to the Sam Houston Tollway loop mentioned above, the Harris County Toll Road Authority currently operates four spoke tollways: The Katy Managed Lanes of Interstate 10, the Hardy Toll Road, the Westpark Tollway, and the Fort Bend Parkway Extension. Other spoke roads either planned or under construction include Crosby Freeway, and the future Alvin Freeway.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the type of freeway system that serves Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hub-and-spoke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What encircles the downtown area of Houston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Interstate 610</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the diameter of the downtown area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 8-mile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the freeway system is Beltway 8?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">middle loop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the diameter of the center of Beltway 8?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23 miles </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The primary city airport is George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), the tenth-busiest in the United States for total passengers, and twenty eighth-busiest worldwide.
