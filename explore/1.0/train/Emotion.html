According to some theories, they are a state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior. The physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system with various states and strengths of arousal relating, apparently, to particular emotions. Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. Extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions. Emotion is often the driving force behind motivation, positive or negative. Definition has been described as is a &quot;positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity.&quot; According to other theories, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include motivation, feeling, behavior, and physiological changes, but no one of these components is the emotion. Nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What system of the body is related to emotion's physiology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nervous </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sorts of people are more likely to be emotionally expressive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Extroverted </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of people hide their emotions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">introverted </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is emotion frequently responsible for driving?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">motivation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with physical changes, what sort of changes do emotions sometimes cause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">psychological </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the &quot;wheel of emotions&quot;, suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt.

Darwin argued that emotions actually served a purpose for humans, in communication and also in aiding their survival. Darwin, therefore, argued that emotions evolved via natural selection and therefore have universal cross-cultural counterparts. Darwin also detailed the virtues of experiencing emotions and the parallel experiences that occur in animals. This led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the book that Darwin wrote on emotions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with survival, what did Darwin see as the role of emotions in humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">communication </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Through what process did Darwin believe emotions developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural selection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did Darwin write?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear).

This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. The novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. Rather the bodily changes themselves perceive the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. A sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book Gut Reactions, and psychologist James Laird's book Feelings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book by Prinz defended the perceptual theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gut Reactions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book on the perceptual theory was written by James Laird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Feelings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Laird's job title?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">psychologist </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Jesse Prinz's profession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philosopher </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What theory argues that conceptual cognition is not required for emotional meaning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the perceptual theory</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Social sciences often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. In sociology, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In anthropology, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of communication sciences, critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to Arlie Russell Hochschild's concept of emotional labor. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet, an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. The list was established in January 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What discipline examines the role emotions play in culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sociology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What discipline makes use of ethnography?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anthropology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What field of study studies the organizational role of emotions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">communication sciences</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the concept of emotional labor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arlie Russell Hochschild</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Roughly how many people are part of EmoNet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">700 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with anger, pride and happiness, what is an example of an emotional label?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fear</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aside from increased perspiration, what is a physiological change related to emotions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">changes in pulse rate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with smiling and frowning, what is an example of a facial or body movement caused by emotion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">baring teeth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed a comprehensive theory related to human emotional arousal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jonathan Turner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many emotional categories did Turner recognize as being founded on human neurology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were William James (1842–1910) and Carl Lange (1834–1900). James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the James–Lange theory, a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with William James, who was an influential 19th century theorist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carl Lange</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was William James' nationality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nationality of Carl Lange?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Danish </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the theory that Lange and James developed independently?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the James–Lange theory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Lange die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1900</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades with many fields contributing including psychology, neuroscience, endocrinology, medicine, history, sociology, and even computer science.

This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion. In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world.

In literature and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In communication studies, scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in ethology, a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, aggression) in a number of unrelated animals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the philosophies of music and art, what field of philosophy studies emotions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ethics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with drama and melodrama, in what filmmaking genre does emotion play an important role?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">romance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what discipline is ethology a branch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">zoology </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with laboratory work, what does an ethologist engage in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">field science</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with evolution, what area of study is ethology tied to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ecology </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sociological attention to emotion has varied over time.

This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock &amp; Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who researched the role of emotional phenotype temperaments on social connectedness?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kurt Kortschal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where do zygotes derive their genetic information?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> their parental germ cells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of difference is there between the genetic material of humans and the genetic material of chimpanzees?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.2%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many million years ago did the evolution of chimpanzees and humans diverge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how long ago did modern human beings first come into existence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200,000 years</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Emotion, in everyday speech, is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure.

Those acting primarily on emotion may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events. For example, the realization of danger and subsequent arousal of the nervous system (e.g. rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of fear.

Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules.

Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose work did the theory of Stanley Schachter build on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gregorio Marañón</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Gregorio Marañón inject his patients with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">epinephrine </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nationality of Gregorio Marañón?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spanish </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a notable student of  Stanley Schachter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jerome Singer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the book Gut Reactions by Jesse Prinz published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2004</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992), pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the &quot;looking glass&quot; that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. Retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley's work, Scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade did sociologists focus on the social relevance of emotion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What emotions did Cooley regard as of paramount social importance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pride and shame</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who studied rage and shame cycles in married couples?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Retzinger </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the social bond theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scheff </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Cooley, from whose work did Scheff derive social bond theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Goffman </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience.

In computer science, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper on affective computing. Detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what discipline is affective computing a branch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">computer science</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the foundational document of affective computing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In affective computing, what devices are used to collect data about the physical state of a user?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">passive sensors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does emotional speech processing determine a user's emotional state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">analyzing speech patterns</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Emotions involve different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior.

More recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components. The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. A similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology.
