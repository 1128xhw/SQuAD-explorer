The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Christians. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a &quot;greater confusion of purpose&quot;, yet led to a war noted for its &quot;notoriously incompetent international butchery.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Crimean War begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1853</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Crimean War end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1856</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who controlled the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ottoman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who promoted the rights of the Catholic people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who promoted the rights of the Eastern Orthodox Christians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russia </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the churches eventually worked out their differences and came to an initial agreement, both Nicholas I of Russia and Napoleon III refused to back down.

Fearing an Ottoman collapse, France and the UK rushed forces to Gallipoli. They then moved north to Varna in June, arriving just in time for the Russians to abandon Silistra. Aside from a minor skirmish at Constanța there was little for the allies to do.

The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed, but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces. A second counterattack, ordered personally by Nicholas, was defeated by Omar Pasha. The front settled into a siege and led to horrible conditions for troops on both sides.

The disbandment of the centuries-old Janissary corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 (Auspicious Incident) was a good deed for the country in the longer term, but it has deprived the country from its army forces for the nearest future. In 1827 the allied Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all the Ottoman naval forces during the Battle of Navarino. In 1830 Greece becomes an independent state after 10 years of independence war and the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829.

The allied fleet left the Gulf of Taganrog on the 2nd September 1855, with minor military operations along the Azov Sea coast continuing until late autumn 1855.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the HMS Jasper to get stuck in shallow water?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a fisherman who moved buoys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who blew up the HMS Jasper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Cossacks </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what days did the allied squadron third siege attempt take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19–31 August</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The allied fleet departed the Gulf of Taganrog on what date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2nd September</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the third siege attempt fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the city was already fortified</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>1853: There were four main events. 1. In the north the Turks captured the border fort of Saint Nicholas in a surprise night attack (27/28 October). They then pushed about 20000 troops across the Cholok River border. Being outnumbered the Russians abandoned Poti and Redut Kale and drew back to Marani. Both sides remained immobile for the next seven months. 2. In the center the Turks moved north from Ardahan to within cannon-shot of Akhaltsike and awaited reinforcements (13 November). The Russians routed them. The claimed losses were 4000 Turks and 400 Russians. 3. In the south about 30000 Turks slowly moved east to the main Russian concentration at Gyumri or Alexandropol (November). They crossed the border and set up artillery south of town. Prince Orbeliani tried to drive them off and found himself trapped. The Turks failed to press their advantage, the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks retired west. Orbeliani lost about 1000 men out of 5000. The Russians now decided to advance, the Turks took up a strong position on the Kars road and attacked. They were defeated in the battle of Başgedikler, losing 6000 men, half their artillery and all their supply train. The Russians lost 1300, including Prince Orbeliani. This was Prince Ellico Orbeliani whose wife was later kidnaped by Shamyl at Tsinandali. 4. At sea the Turks sent a fleet east which was destroyed by Admiral Nakhimov at Sinope.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who captured the border front of Saint Nicholas during a night attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Turks </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did the Turks have when crossing the Cholok River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20000 troops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After giving up their position at Poti and Redut Kale, where did the Russians retreat to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marani</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did the Turks send to Gyumri?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the Turks waiting for when positioned near Akhaltsike?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reinforcements</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the north Eristov pushed southwest, fought two battles, forced the Turks back to Batum, retired behind the Cholok River and suspended action for the rest of the year (June).

On 4 August Russian scouts saw a movement which they thought was the start of a withdrawal, the Russians advanced and the Turks attacked first. They were defeated, losing 8000 men to the Russian 3000. 10000 irregulars deserted to their villages. Both sides withdrew to their former positions.

He therefore decided to control the surrounding area with cavalry and starve them out. He started in May and by June was south and west of the town. A relieving force fell back and there was a possibility of taking Erzerum, but Muravyev chose not to. In late September he learned of the fall of Sevastopol and a Turkish landing at Batum.

Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which was close to Saint Petersburg, the Russian capital. In April 1854 an Anglo-French fleet entered the Baltic to attack the Russian naval base of Kronstadt and the Russian fleet stationed there. In August 1854 the combined British and French fleet returned to Kronstadt for another attempt. The outnumbered Russian Baltic Fleet confined its movements to the areas around its fortifications. At the same time, the British and French commanders Sir Charles Napier and Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes—although they led the largest fleet assembled since the Napoleonic Wars—considered the Sveaborg fortress too well-defended to engage. Thus, shelling of the Russian batteries was limited to two attempts in the summers of 1854 and 1855, and initially, the attacking fleets limited their actions to blockading Russian trade in the Gulf of Finland. Naval attacks on other ports, such as the ones in the island of Hogland in the Gulf of Finland, proved more successful. Additionally, allies conducted raids on less fortified sections of the Finnish coast. These battles are known in Finland as the Åland war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Russian capital?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint Petersburg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which theater was next to Saint Petersburg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Baltic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which fleet joined the Baltic attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anglo-French fleet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Anglo-French fleet join the Baltic attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 1854</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two fleets returned to Kronstadt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British and French fleet</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In August 1855 a Franco-British naval force captured and destroyed the Russian Bomarsund fortress on Åland Islands.

Greece, an Orthodox nation, had considerable support in Russia, but the Russian government decided it was too dangerous to help Greece expand its holdings.:32–40 When the Russians invaded the Principalities, the Ottoman forces were tied down so Greece invaded Thessaly and Epirus. To block further Greek moves, the British and French occupied the main Greek port at Piraeus from April 1854 to February 1857, and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Greeks, gambling on a Russian victory, incited the large-scale Epirus Revolt of 1854 as well as uprisings in Crete. The insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the Ottoman army. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war.:139 The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire who glimpsed an opportunity to advance North and South?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Otto of Greece</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When the Ottoman forces were busy, who did Greece invade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thessaly and Epirus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From April 1854 to February 1857, what port did the British and French lock down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek port at Piraeus </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Epirus Revolt take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1854</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who stirred up the Epirus Revolt of 1854?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greeks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in the UK and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos, especially the humiliating defeat of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava.

While Prussia and several other German states united to form a powerful German Empire, the Emperor of the French, Napoleon III, was deposed to permit the formation of a Third French Republic. During his reign, Napoleon III, eager for the support of the United Kingdom, had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question. Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire, however, did not in any significant manner threaten the interests of France. Thus, France abandoned its opposition to Russia after the establishment of a republic. Encouraged by the decision of the French, and supported by the German minister Otto von Bismarck, Russia renounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As the United Kingdom alone could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a fleet in the Black Sea.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Treaty of Paris fall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1871</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what war was France defeated by Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Franco-Prussian War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between what years did the  Franco-Prussian War take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870–1871</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Napoleon III was removed to form what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Third French Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who renounced the Black Sea clause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russia </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although it was Russia that was punished by the Paris Treaty, in the long run it was Austria that lost the most from the Crimean War despite having barely taken part in it.:433 Having abandoned its alliance with Russia, Austria was diplomatically isolated following the war,:433 which contributed to its disastrous defeats in the 1859 Franco-Austrian War that resulted in the cession of Lombardy to the Kingdom of Sardinia, and later in the loss of the Habsburg rule of Tuscany and Modena, which meant the end of Austrian influence in Italy. Furthermore, Russia did not do anything to assist its former ally, Austria, in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War:433 with its loss of Venetia and more important than that, its influence in most German-speaking lands. The status of Austria as a great power, with the unifications of Germany and Italy was now severely questioned. It had to compromise with Hungary, the two countries shared the Danubian Empire and Austria slowly became a little more than a German satellite. With France now hostile to Germany, allied with Russia, and Russia competing with the newly renamed Austro-Hungarian Empire for an increased role in the Balkans at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, the foundations were in place for creating the diplomatic alliances that would lead to World War I.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who lost the most due to the Crimean War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Russia failed to help Austria during what war that took place in 1866?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austro-Prussian War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became diplomatically isolated after the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kingdom of Sardinia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Crimean War marked the ascendancy of France to the position of pre-eminent power on the Continent,:411 the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire, and the beginning of a decline for Tsarist Russia.

However, the reform campaign was not well organized, and the traditional aristocratic leadership of the Army pulled itself together, and blocked all serious reforms. No one was punished. The outbreak of the Indian Revolution in 1857 shifted attention to the heroic defense of British interest by the army, and further talk of reform went nowhere.
