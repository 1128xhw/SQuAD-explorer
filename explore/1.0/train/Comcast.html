Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service area; there is limited competition among cable providers. Given Comcast's negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. Its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and content distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns.

In 2002, Comcast acquired all assets of AT&amp;T Broadband, thus making Comcast the largest cable television company in the United States with over 22 million subscribers. This also spurred the start of Comcast Advertising Sales (using AT&amp;T's groundwork) which would later be renamed Comcast Spotlight. As part of this acquisition, Comcast also acquired the National Digital Television Center in Centennial, Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary, which is today known as the Comcast Media Center.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Comcast acquire the cable assets of AT&amp;T Broadband?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Comcast pay for this subsidiary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$44.5 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original name of AT&amp;T Broadband and Comcast going to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AT&amp;T Comcast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Comcast purchased AT&amp;T Broadband, how many customers did they service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Comcast's advertising and commercial production branch was called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Comcast Spotlight</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On February 11, 2004, Comcast announced a $54 billion bid for The Walt Disney Company, as well as taking on $12 billion of Disney's debt.

Brown's wife, Lisa, believed a Comcast employee changed the name in response to the Browns' request to cancel their cable service, an incident in which she was refused a cancellation unless she paid a $60 fee and instead was routed to a retention specialist. Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing it to the attention of numerous customer service outlets for the company by explaining that Ricardo is the legal name of the customer, so the Browns turned to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott. Elliott posted the facts of the incident, along with a copy of the bill, on his blog. Shortly thereafter, Elliott contacted Comcast and Comcast offered the Browns an apology, a $60 refund, and a promise to track down and fire the responsible employee. The Browns instead requested a full refund for their negative experience and Comcast agreed to refund the family the last two years of service and provide the next two years of service at no charge. Comcast released a statement explaining: &quot;We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change. We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.&quot; </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name was listed on Comcast customer Ricardo Brown's invoice in January, 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Asshole Brown&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What consumer advocate took over the Brown's case?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christopher Elliott</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the amount of disputed money that Comcast eventually returned to the Browns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$60</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Comcast eventually refunded how much service time to the Browns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Comcast also told the Browns they would do what to correct the situation with the name change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">promise to track down and fire the responsible employee</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
