It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages (and therefore used to be also called phonemics, or phonematics), but it may also cover any linguistic analysis either at a level beneath the word (including syllable, onset and rime, articulatory gestures, articulatory features, mora, etc.) or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning.

While phonetics concerns the physical production, acoustic transmission and perception of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning. For many linguists, phonetics belongs to descriptive linguistics, and phonology to theoretical linguistics, although establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence. Note that this distinction was not always made, particularly before the development of the modern concept of the phoneme in the mid 20th century. Some subfields of modern phonology have a crossover with phonetics in descriptive disciplines such as psycholinguistics and speech perception, resulting in specific areas like articulatory phonology or laboratory phonology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of linguistics is phonology distinguished from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phonetics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of linguistics is phonetics considered to be a part of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">descriptive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Phonology is generally considered a part of the theoretical side of what discipline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">linguistics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the phonome's modern concept developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> mid 20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subfield of modern phonology other than phsycholinguistics crosses over with phonetics? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">speech perception</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The word phonology comes from the Greek φωνή, phōnḗ, &quot;voice, sound,&quot; and the suffix -logy (which is from Greek λόγος, lógos, &quot;word, speech, subject of discussion&quot;). Definitions of the term vary. Nikolai Trubetzkoy in Grundzüge der Phonologie (1939) defines phonology as &quot;the study of sound pertaining to the system of language,&quot; as opposed to phonetics, which is &quot;the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech&quot; (the distinction between language and speech being basically Saussure's distinction between langue and parole). More recently, Lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, &quot;phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items.&quot; According to Clark et al. (2007), it means the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken human language, or the field of linguistics studying this use.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language does phonology as a word come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Greek word is -logy derived from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lógos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who in 1939 defined phonology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Nikolai Trubetzkoy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A distinction was drawn between language and what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">speech</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Lass write about phonology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1998</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The history of phonology may be traced back to the Ashtadhyayi, the Sanskrit grammar composed by Pāṇini in the 4th century BC.

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was The Sound Pattern of English published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1968</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than Chomsky who else published The Sound Pattern of English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Morris Halle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides the syllable what was downplayed as a result of SPE's influence on phonological theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emphasis on segments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other discipline was combined with phonology by the generativists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">morphophonology</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Natural phonology is a theory based on the publications of its proponent David Stampe in 1969 and (more explicitly) in 1979. In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan.

Dressler, who founded natural morphology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose publications started the theory of Natural phonology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Stampe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Stampe what is phonology based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a set of universal phonological processes </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aside from being active what other condition can the universal phonological processes exist in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">suppressed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the number two natural phonologist?  </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Patricia Donegan </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the founder of natural morphology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wolfgang U.

However, English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations (allophones) of the same phonological category, that is of the phoneme /p/. (Traditionally, it would be argued that if an aspirated [pʰ] were interchanged with the unaspirated [p] in spot, native speakers of English would still hear the same words; that is, the two sounds are perceived as &quot;the same&quot; /p/.) In some other languages, however, these two sounds are perceived as different, and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes. For example, in Thai, Hindi, and Quechua, there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature (two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the units called that traditional phonology studies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phonemes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another word for variations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allophones</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the opposite of aspirated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unaspirated</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Part of the phonological study of a language therefore involves looking at data (phonetic transcriptions of the speech of native speakers) and trying to deduce what the underlying phonemes are and what the sound inventory of the language is.
