The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Football League Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship, together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs, are promoted in their place.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does the Premier League have its playing season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">During the course of a season (from August to May)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many games does each club play each season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many points does each club receive for each win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teams receive three points for a win</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which criteria is used to rank the clubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is a tie for the championship handled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many clubs are currently in the Premier League?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which month marks the start of a Premier League season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which month marks the start of a Premier League season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times does each club play every other club?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many total games does each club in the Premier League play per season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">38</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The team placed fifth in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, and the sixth and seventh-placed teams can also qualify, depending on the winners of the two domestic cup competitions i.e. the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup (League Cup).

UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League.

The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was the amount of first five seasons of the Sky television rights?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much many did the Premier League make from selling its internation rights during 2004-07?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Sky's agreement in 2006.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did this happen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the average income from media from 2007-2010 for the Premier League?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many seasons did the first television rights contract award to Sky?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was the first television rights contract awarded to Sky worth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£304 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was the second television rights contract awarded to Sky worth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£670 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was the third television rights contract awarded to Sky worth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£1.024 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By being awarded television rights, which other network broke Sky's monopoly on Premier League coverage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Setanta Sports</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases have arisen as a result.

Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment.

The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Premier League Championship trophy based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where on the trophy can two of the lions be seen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can the third lion be seen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the third is symbolised by the captain of the title winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the ribbons on the trophy mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Golden Boot is made of sterling silver, silver gilt and which semi-precious stone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">malachite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what type of metal band are the title-winning clubs listed on the Golden Boot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silver </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the green colour of Malachite on the Golden Boot represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the green field of play</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many lions are found on the Golden Boot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Two </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who symbolizes the third lion not found on the Golden Boot trophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the captain of the title winning team</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
