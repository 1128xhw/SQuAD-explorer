Geographically, the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia. The country's population of 53,158 people (at the 2011 Census) is spread out over 29 coral atolls, comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets. The islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west, Wake Island to the north,[note 2] Kiribati to the south-east, and Nauru to the south. About 27,797 of the islanders (at the 2011 Census) live on Majuro, which contains the capital.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the Marshall Islands in its native language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aolepān Aorōkin M̧ajeļ</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Near what major line of latitutde are the Marshall Islands located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the equator </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of 2011, how many people live in the Marshall Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">53,158 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country borders the Marshall Islands on the western side?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Federated States of Micronesia </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which island is home to the capital of the Marshall Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Majuro</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the official name of the Marshall Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Republic of the Marshall Islands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what ocean are the Marshall Islands located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pacific Ocean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people lived in the Marshall Islands in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">53,158</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many coral atolls comprise the Marshall Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">29 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what island is the capital of the Marshall Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Majuro</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands during the 2nd millennium BC, with inter-island navigation made possible using traditional stick charts.

However, Spain sold the islands to the German Empire in 1884, and they became part of German New Guinea in 1885. In World War I the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands, which in 1919 the League of Nations combined with other former German territories to form the South Pacific Mandate. In World War II, the United States conquered the islands in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. Along with other Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands were then consolidated into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands governed by the US. Self-government was achieved in 1979, and full sovereignty in 1986, under a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Marshall Islands has been a United Nations member state since 1991.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Marshall Islands gain official recognition by the major European nations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1874</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1884, which country purchased the Marshall Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the German Empire </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group was the Marshall Islands a part of following World War I?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the South Pacific Mandate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took over the Marshall Islands in the second world war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the United States </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Marshall Islands achieve total sovereignty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1986</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What European nation owned the Marshall Islands in 1874?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spain </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought the Marshall Islands from the Spanish in 1884?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the German Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who occupied the Marshall Islands during the First World War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the South Pacific Mandate created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Marshall Islands become a sovereign nation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1986</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Politically, the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with the United States, with the US providing defense, subsidies, and access to U.S. based agencies such as the FCC and the USPS.

The designation was repeated later on British maps.[citation needed] In 1824 the crew of the American whaler Globe mutinied and some of the crew put ashore on Mulgrave Island.

Coconut trees abound in the Pacific's tropical islands. Copra, the meat of the coconut, yields coconut oil (1 liter for every 6 to 10 coconuts). In 2009, a 57 kW solar power plant was installed, the largest in the Pacific at the time, including New Zealand. It is estimated that 330 kW of solar and 450 kW of wind power would be required to make the College of the Marshall Islands energy self-sufficient. Marshalls Energy Company (MEC), a government entity, provides the islands with electricity. In 2008, 420 solar home systems of 200 Wp each were installed on Ailinglaplap Atoll, sufficient for limited electricity use.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Witon Barry work for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Tobolar Copra processing plant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Tobolar Copra plant located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Majuro</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is copra?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the meat of the coconut</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many coconuts are required to produce 1 liter of coconut oil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 6 to 10</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many kilowatts of power are produced by the solar plant built in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">57 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historical population figures are unknown.
