Founded in 1701 in Saybrook Colony as the Collegiate School, the University is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States. The school was renamed Yale College in 1718 in recognition of a gift from Elihu Yale, who was governor of the British East India Company. Established to train Congregationalist ministers in theology and sacred languages, by 1777 the school's curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences. In the 19th century the school incorporated graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Collegiate School of Saybrook Colony founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1701</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Collegiate School renamed to Yale College?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1718</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the school named Yale College?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">recognition of a gift from Elihu Yale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Yale first incorporate humanities and sciences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by 1777</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Yale issue the first Ph.D in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1861</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and twelve professional schools.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon thereafter, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers: Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather, Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell in Branford, Connecticut, to pool their books to form the school's library.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the &quot;new divinity.&quot; In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and struggled to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy; but he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Elihu Yale grow up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wales</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Elihu Yale born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Elihu Yale's father's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> David</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who suggested the new name of Yale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cotton Mather</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many books were in the 1714 shipment to Yale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">500</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. Fanning later was granted an honorary degree LL.D., at 1803, for his efforts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Ezra Stiles president of Yale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1778 to 1795</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What course did Ezra Stiles require freshmen to take?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hebrew</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the British threaten to take over the college?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 1779</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who saved Yale from the British raid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edmund Fanning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What degree was Edmund Fanning given for his services?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an honorary degree LL.D</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without. William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. He bested President Noah Porter, who disliked social science and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did William Graham Sumner teach?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1872 to 1909</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did William Graham Sumner teach?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">economics and sociology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was The Yale Report established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the classics would not be abandoned</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the group of Yale professors and ministers attempting to achieve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What changes were the professors and ministers responding to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Victorian culture</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the prototype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who &quot;regretted&quot; that he &quot;had but one life to lose&quot; for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Nathan Hale famous for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Revolutionary War soldier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What profession did Frederic Remington hold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">artist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the protagonist of &quot;Stover at Yale&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Stover</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What turned into the goal of the student body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">winning the big game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the subjects of Frederic Remington's paintings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the first debate between Harvard, Yale, and Princeton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1909</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first debate between Harvard and Yale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1892</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were debates shown to the college students?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">front pages of college newspapers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did members of the debate team get for their service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do debates not have a distinct winner?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scoring is subjective</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06 to solve the problem of serious injuries.

During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture.

The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President James R. Angell and psychobiologist Robert M.

Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not.

Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Yale own 500 acres of athletic facilities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">western New Haven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What campus did Yale buy in 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> former Bayer Pharmaceutical campus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the former Bayer Pharmaceutical campus used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> laboratory and research space</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many forests does Yale own?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How big is the largest forest in Yale's possession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7,840-acre</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus as well as for several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art &amp; Architecture Building.

Harkness Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who financed a large chunk of the architecture from 1917 to 1931</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward S.

Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called &quot;Yale School&quot;. These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century.

Calhoun, a slave-owner and strong slavery supporter in the nineteenth century. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change. They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an &quot;extraordinary American statesman&quot;—he was &quot;one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy&quot; in the history of the United States. In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed. He described Calhoun as a &quot;a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina.&quot; He acknowledged that Calhoun also &quot;believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude.

Christakis and his wife Erika regarding freedom of speech. In April 2016 Salovey announced that &quot;despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,&quot; Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's &quot;shadow&quot; so they will be &quot;better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future.&quot; He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would &quot;obscure&quot; his &quot;legacy of slavery rather than addressing it.&quot; &quot;Yale is part of that history&quot; and &quot;We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.&quot; One change that will be issued is the title of “master” for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to “head of college” due to its connotation of slavery.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Calhoun college named for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John C.

In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014, but its future remains uncertain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do seniors crush to celebrate graduation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">clay pipes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do they destroy now instead of clay pipes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bubble pipes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What statue is it rumored to be good luck to rub?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey is it said to be good luck to rub?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the toe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What game was created, to later be banned by administration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Bladderball</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural &quot;bowl&quot; stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.
