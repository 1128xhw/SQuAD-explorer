Hidalgo built a large support among intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people. Hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population. He started on a march to the capital, Mexico City, but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal government from Guadalajara, Jalisco but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city. Hidalgo attempted to reach the United States and gain American support for Mexican independence. HIdalgo reached Saltillo, Coahuila where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by Viceroy Francisco Venegas in return for Hidalgo's surrender. A short time later, he and his supporters were captured by royalist Ignacio Elizondo at the Wells of Baján (Norias de Baján) on March 21, 1811 and taken to the city of Chihuahua. Hidalgo forced the Bishop of Valladolid, Manuel Abad y Queipo, to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on September 24, 1810. Later, the Inquisition issued an excommunication edict on October 13, 1810 condemning Miguel Hidalgo as a seditionary, apostate, and heretic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the town in which Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla declared independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dolores</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Proclamation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grito de Dolores</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Hidalgo's occupation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">priest </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the royalist who captured Hidalgo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ignacio Elizondo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country had Hidalgo attempted to reach to gain support?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At a convention of citizens called to select a new provisional ruler, Gutierrez obtained the vote, with P.

Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.–Mexican border of the Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, Ángel Trías sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with Ángel Trías, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican–American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the treaty that ended the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year was the treaty signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1848</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Control over which current U.S. state was given to the U.S. under this treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Texas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the U.S. continue to maintain control over the state capital after the treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which American general misunderstood the Mexican message sent to Sacramento Pass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Price</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In consequence to the Reform War, the federal government was bankrupt and could not pay its foreign debts to Spain, England, and France.

Lerdeo de Tejada won the election, but lost popularity after he announced his intent to run for re-election. On March 21, 1876, Don Porfirio Díaz rebelled against President Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. The Plan of Tuxtepec defended the &quot;No Re-election&quot; principle. On June 2, 1876 the garrisons in the state of Chihuahua surrendered to the authority of General Porfirio Díaz; Governor Antonio Ochoa was arrested until all the Lerdista forces were suppressed throughout the state. Porfirio Díaz then helped Tíras regain the governorship of the state of Chihuahua allowing for the Plan of Tuxtepec to be implemented. The victory of the Plan of Tuxtepec, gave the interim presidency to Jose Maria Iglesias and later, as the only candidate, the General Porfirio Díaz assumed the presidency on May 5, 1877. During the first years of the Porfiriato (Porfirio Díaz Era), the Díaz administration had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache. A new rebellion led by the Lerdista party was orchestrated from exile in the United States. The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of El Paso del Norte until mid-1877.

An archeological site in northern Chihuahua known as Cerro Juanaqueña revealed squash cultivation, irrigation techniques, and ceramic artifacts dating to around 2000 BC.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which areas were the earliest human inhabitants discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Samalayuca and Rancho Colorado</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What range of years are the oldest ruins from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12,000 BC to 7000 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which vegetable were they found to have been farming?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">corn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around what year were the ceramic artifacts found to have been from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the period from 2000–2005 it is estimated that 49,722 people left the state for the United States.

Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be &quot;precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.&quot; Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country. Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo's image in half a dozen murals. José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work. David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo's birth. The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year on the night of 15–16 September, the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace. This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico. The remains of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City.

The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jesús González Ortega and José María Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders José María Patoni of Durango and J.E. Muñoz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree. The state elected General Luis Terrazas, a liberal leader, as governor; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year was the new constitution ratified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1855</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The state was able to survive through which war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Reform War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The conservative movement occurred during which year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1858 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">1000 men occupied which cities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chihuahua and Parral</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who established himself as governor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cajen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After running imperial military affairs in the states of Coahuila and Durango, General Agustín Enrique Brincourt made preparations to invade the state of Chihuahua. On July 8, 1865 Brincourt crossed the Nazas River in northern Durango, heading toward Chihuahua. On July 22 Brincourt crossed the banks of Río Florido into Ciudad Jiménez; one day later he arrived at Valle de Allende where he sent Colonel Pyot with a garrison to take control of Hidalgo del Parral. Brincourt continued through Santa Rosalia de Camargo and Santa Cruz de Rosales. President Juárez remained in the state capital until August 5, 1865 when he left for El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Juárez) due to evidence that the French were to attack the city. On the same day, the President named General Manuel Ojinaga the new governor and placed him in charge of all the republican forces. Meanwhile, General Villagran surprised the imperial forces in control of Hidalgo de Parral; after a short two-hour battle, Colonel Pyot was defeated and forced to retreat. At the Battle of Parral, the French lost 55 men to the Republican forces. On August 13, 1865, the French forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of Chihuahua City, and on August 15, 1865, General Brincourt defeated the republican forces, taking control of the state capital. Brincourt designated Tomás Zuloaga as Prefect of Chihuahua. Fearing the French would continue their campaign to El Paso del Norte, President Juárez relocated to El Carrizal, a secluded place in the mountains near El Paso del Norte, in August 1865, . It would have been easy for the French forces to continue in pursuit of President Juárez across the border, but they feared altercations with American forces. General François Achille Bazaine ordered the French troops to retreat back to the state of Durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of Chihuahua City. General Brincourt asked for 1,000 men to be left behind to help maintain control over the state, but his request was denied. After the death of General Ojinaga, the Republican government declared General Villagran in charge of the fight against the Imperial forces. The French left the state on October 29, 1865. President Juárez returned to Chihuahua City on November 20, 1865 and remained in the city until December 9, 1865 when he returned to El Paso del Norte. Shortly after the president left Chihuahua City, Terrazas was restored as governor of the state on December 11, 1865.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Brincourt made preparations to invade which state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chihuahua</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which states had Brincourt run military affairs previously?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Coahuila and Durango</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who remained in the capital until August 5, 1865?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President Juárez </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who surprised the imperial forces in control of Hidalgo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Villagran</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Republican government declared who in charge of the fight against the imperialists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Villagran</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>General Aguirre moved to the deserts of the southeastern portion of the state and defeated the French forces in Parral, led by Colonel Cottret.

On June 17, 1866, President Juárez arrived in Chihuahua City and remained in the capital until December 10, 1866. During his two years in the state of Chihuahua, President Juárez passed ordinances regarding the rights of adjudication of property and nationalized the property of the clergy. The distance of the French forces and their allies allowed the Ministry of War, led by General Negrete, to reorganize the state's national guard into the Patriotic Battalion of Chihuahua, which was deployed to fight in the battle of Matamoros, Tamaulipas against the French. After a series of major defeats and an escalating threat from Prussia, France began pulling troops out of Mexico in late 1866. Disillusioned with the liberal political views of Maximilian, the Mexican conservatives abandoned him, and in 1867 the last of the Emperor's forces were defeated. Maximilian was sentenced to death by a military court; despite national and international pleas for amnesty, Juárez refused to commute the sentence. Maximilian was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Aguirre defeat the French forces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parral</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had been leading the French forces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colonel Cottret</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which year was Chihuahua declared free of enemy control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1866</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who passed laws regarding rights of adjudication of property?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President Juárez</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maximilian </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The United States Congress declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846 after only having a few hours to debate.

After the American invasion of New Mexico, Chihuahua sent 12,000 men led by Colonel Vidal to the border to stop the American military advance into the state. The Mexican forces being impatient to confront the American forces passed beyond El Paso del Norte about 20 miles (32 km) north along the Rio Grande. The first battle that Chihuahua fought was the battle of El Bracito; the Mexican forces consisting of 500 cavalry and 70 infantry confronted a force of 1,100–1,200 Americans on December 25, 1846. The battle ended badly by the Mexican forces that were then forced to retreat back into the state of Chihuahua. By December 27, 1846, the American forces occupied El Paso Del Norte.

General Canto turned himself over to Donato Guerra. Canto was sentenced to death, but later his sentence changed to 10 years imprisonment. The sense of injustice gave rise to a new rebellion in 1869 that threatened the federal government. In response, the Juárez administration took drastic measures by temporarily suspending constitutional rights, but the governor of Chihuahua did not support this action. Hostilities continued to increase especially after the election of 1871 which was perceived to be fraudulent. A new popular leader arose among the rebels, Porfirio Díaz. The federal government was successful in quelling rebellions in Durango an Chihuahua. On July 18, 1872, President Juárez died from a heart attack; soon after, many of his supporters ceased the fighting.

The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining. The Díaz administration helped Governor Luis Terrazas by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad Júarez. By 1881, the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez. In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state, allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cites of Julimes, Meoqui, and Hidalgo del Parral; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers. The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration, mostly from China. Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening restaurants, small grocery stores, and hotels. By the end of the Terrazas term, the state experienced an increase in commerce, mining, and banking.

Being completely caught off guard, the French imperial forces sought refuge by bunkering themselves in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Our Lady of Regla, and St Fancis of Assisi and made it almost impossible to penetrate their defenses.

The first cannon fired hit a bell in the tower of the church, instantly breaking it in half; soon after, 200 men of the imperial army forces surrendered. The republican forces had recovered control over the state capital. The bell in the church was declared a historical monument and can be seen today in the Cathedral.

Casavantes took the state capital and occupied it briefly; he was also successful in forcing Governor Trías to exile. Shortly afterwards, the federal government sent an entourage led by Treviño; Casavantes was immediately ordered to resign his position. Casavantes declared political victory as he was able to publicly accuse and depose Governor Trías. At the same time the states of Durango and Coahuila had a military confrontation over territorial claims and water rights; this altercation between the state required additional federal troops to stabilize the area. Later a dispute ensued again among the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua over the mountain range area known as Sierra Mojada, when large deposits of gold ore was discovered. The state of Chihuahua officially submitted a declaration of protest in May 1880 that shortly after was amicably settled.
