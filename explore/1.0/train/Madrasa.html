The word is variously transliterated madrasah, madarasaa, medresa, madrassa, madraza, medrese, etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. Not all students in madaris are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the origins of the word madrasa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arabic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of educational institution does the term madrasa refer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">any type</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Western culture, the term madrasa widely refers to the practices of what religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many students enrolled in madaris are Muslim?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Not all</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س D-R-S 'to learn, study', through the wazn (form/stem) مفعل(ة)‎; mafʻal(ah), meaning &quot;a place where something is done&quot;. Therefore, madrasah literally means &quot;a place where learning and studying take place&quot;. The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian / Croatian. In the Arabic language, the word مدرسة madrasah simply means the same as school does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word school in British English, the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as danişmends. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is جامعة (jāmiʻah). The Hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the root origins of the word madrasah?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">triconsonantal Semitic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the literal translation of madrasah?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a place where learning and studying take place</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Arabic, what does madarasah mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">same as school does in the English language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Ottoman Empire, what types of schools were typical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lower schools and specialised</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the students in madaris called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">danişmends</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, in English, the term madrasah usually refers to the specifically Islamic institutions. A typical Islamic school usually offers two courses of study: a ḥifẓ course teaching memorization of the Qur'an (the person who commits the entire Qurʼan to memory is called a ḥāfiẓ); and an ʻālim course leading the candidate to become an accepted scholar in the community. A regular curriculum includes courses in Arabic, tafsir (Qur'anic interpretation), sharīʻah (Islamic law), hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Muhammad), mantiq (logic), and Muslim history. In the Ottoman Empire, during the Early Modern Period, the study of hadiths was introduced by Süleyman I. Depending on the educational demands, some madaris also offer additional advanced courses in Arabic literature, English and other foreign languages, as well as science and world history. Ottoman madaris along with religious teachings also taught &quot;styles of writing, grammary, syntax, poetry, composition, natural sciences, political sciences, and etiquette.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the English connotative understanding of the word madrash? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamic institutions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is taught through a hifz class or set of classes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">memorization of the Qur'an</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is shariah?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamic law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the discipline taught in mantiq courses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">logic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What set of courses does someone need to take for preparation to be considered as a scholar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ālim</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>People of all ages attend, and many often move on to becoming imams.[citation needed] The certificate of an ʻālim, for example, requires approximately twelve years of study.[citation needed] A good number of the ḥuffāẓ (plural of ḥāfiẓ) are the product of the madaris.

Especially during the Mamlūk period, when only former slaves could assume power, the sons of the ruling Mamlūk elite were unable to inherit.

Within several centuries, the development of Muslim educational institutions such as the madrasah and masjid eventually introduced such activities to provincial towns and dispersed them across the Islamic legal schools and Sufi orders. In addition to religious subjects, they also taught the &quot;rational sciences,&quot; as varied as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, geography, alchemy, philosophy, magic, and occultism, depending on the curriculum of the specific institution in question. The madaris, however, were not centres of advanced scientific study; scientific advances in Islam were usually carried out by scholars working under the patronage of royal courts. During this time,[when?] the Caliphate experienced a growth in literacy, having the highest literacy rate of the Middle Ages, comparable to classical Athens' literacy in antiquity but on a much larger scale. The emergence of the maktab and madrasa institutions played a fundamental role in the relatively high literacy rates of the medieval Islamic world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who traditionally paid for scholars to study natural sciences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">royal courts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of people had the highest literacy rates during the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Caliphate </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What schools had the biggest impact on the rising literacy rates in the Caliphate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">maktab and madrasa institutions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did it take for madaris to spread to smaller cities and towns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several centuries</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a maktab, which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madaris (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to an endowed mosque. In the 11th century, the famous Persian Islamic philosopher and teacher Ibn Sīnā (known as Avicenna in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter about the maktab entitled &quot;The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children,&quot; as a guide to teachers working at maktab schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils, as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn Sīnā described the curriculum of a maktab school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a maktab school.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the first recorded Islamic elementary schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term refers to Islamic elementary schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">maktab</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote a training guide for Islamic maktab teachers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ibn Sīnā</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ibn Sina prefer over private tutors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many component of education did Ibn Sina describe in their teachings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ibn Sīnā refers to the secondary education stage of maktab schooling as a period of specialisation when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status.

Some madaris further extended their curriculum to history, politics, ethics, music, metaphysics, medicine, astronomy and chemistry. The curriculum of a madrasah was usually set by its founder, but most generally taught both the religious sciences and the physical sciences. Madaris were established throughout the Islamic world, examples being the 9th century University of al-Qarawiyyin, the 10th century al-Azhar University (the most famous), the 11th century Niẓāmīyah, as well as 75 madaris in Cairo, 51 in Damascus and up to 44 in Aleppo between 1155 and 1260.

George Makdisi considers the ijāzah to be the origin of the European doctorate. However, in an earlier article, he considered the ijāzah to be of &quot;fundamental difference&quot; to the medieval doctorate, since the former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar not obliged to follow any formal criteria, whereas the latter was conferred on the student by the collective authority of the faculty. To obtain an ijāzah, a student &quot;had to study in a guild school of law, usually four years for the basic undergraduate course&quot; and ten or more years for a post-graduate course. The &quot;doctorate was obtained after an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate's theses&quot;, and to test the student's &quot;ability to defend them against all objections, in disputations set up for the purpose.&quot; These were scholarly exercises practised throughout the student's &quot;career as a graduate student of law.&quot; After students completed their post-graduate education, they were awarded ijazas giving them the status of faqīh 'scholar of jurisprudence', muftī 'scholar competent in issuing fatwās', and mudarris 'teacher'.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term refers to Islamic law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fiqh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Islamic law school begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did a student have to study law, in early Islamic law graduate schools, in order to graduate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> ten or more years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What traditional schooling has been considered modeled after the traditional Islamic graduate schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European doctorate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Arabic term ijāzat al-tadrīs was awarded to Islamic scholars who were qualified to teach.

The mufti (professor of legal opinions) took this question, studied it, researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures, in order to find a solution to it. This process of scholarly research was called ijtihād, literally, the exertion of one's efforts to the utmost limit.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What determination of the study of law was held to much debate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">whether certain opinions of law were orthodox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of matters are covered through Islamic law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">civil as well as religious</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Islamic term for issuing a legal opinion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fatwa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is ijtihad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">process of scholarly research</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is disagreement whether madaris ever became universities.

Other academic subjects, including the natural sciences, philosophy and literary studies, were only treated &quot;ancillary&quot; to the study of the Sharia. For example, a natural science like astronomy was only studied (if at all) to supply religious needs, like the time for prayer. This is why Ptolemaic astronomy was considered adequate, and is still taught in some modern day madaris. The Islamic law undergraduate degree from al-Azhar, the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally granted without final examinations, but on the basis of the students' attentive attendance to courses.

Despite the many similarities, medieval specialists have coined the term &quot;Islamic college&quot; for madrasa and jāmiʻah to differentiate them from the legally autonomous corporations that the medieval European universities were.

In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendent), resulted in a &quot;spurt&quot; of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the Maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular. Unlike the corporate designation of Western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula. The madrasa of al-Qarawīyīn, one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the &quot;first universities&quot; by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as 1947. The other, al-Azhar, did acquire this status in name and essence only in the course of numerous reforms during the 19th and 20th century, notably the one of 1961 which introduced non-religious subjects to its curriculum, such as economics, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. It should also be noted that many medieval universities were run for centuries as Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools prior to their formal establishment as universitas scholarium; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the university dates back to the 6th century AD, thus well preceding the earliest madaris. George Makdisi, who has published most extensively on the topic concludes in his comparison between the two institutions:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did more madaris begin to form more rapidly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11th and 12th centuries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are madaris considered less desirable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western Islamic lands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the al-Qarawiyin officially become a university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1947</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When the madaris are considered as a charity, who controls the school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the donor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What disciplines were introduced at al-Azhar in 1961?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">economics, engineering, medicine, and agriculture</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nevertheless, Makdisi has asserted that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including &quot;the fact that we still talk of professors holding the 'Chair' of their subject&quot; being based on the &quot;traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him&quot;, the term 'academic circles' being derived from the way in which Islamic students &quot;sat in a circle around their professor&quot;, and terms such as &quot;having 'fellows', 'reading' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back&quot; to the Islamic concepts of aṣḥāb ('companions, as of Muhammad'), qirāʼah ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and ijāzah ('licence [to teach]') respectively. Makdisi has listed eighteen such parallels in terminology which can be traced back to their roots in Islamic education. Some of the practices now common in modern universities which Makdisi and Goddard trace back to an Islamic root include &quot;practices such as delivering inaugural lectures, wearing academic robes, obtaining doctorates by defending a thesis, and even the idea of academic freedom are also modelled on Islamic custom.&quot; The Islamic scholarly system of fatwá and ijmāʻ, meaning opinion and consensus respectively, formed the basis of the &quot;scholarly system the West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages down to the present day.&quot; According to Makdisi and Goddard, &quot;the idea of academic freedom&quot; in universities was also &quot;modelled on Islamic custom&quot; as practised in the medieval Madrasa system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was &quot;certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university&quot; in Europe, the University of Naples Federico II founded by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1224.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What institutions have been considered to take some its ideas from madaris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European university</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many corollaries dd Makdisi make between Islamic language and European educational practices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eighteen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Eurpoean university practices are considered to be adapted from madaris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">degree and doctorate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What freedom specifically did Makdisi believe European schools learned from Islamic traditions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">academic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What clothing practice did Makdisi believe European schools learned from madaris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wearing academic robes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by standard scholarship to be independent medieval European developments with no tracable Islamic influence. Generally, some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on &quot;the accumulation of close parallels&quot;, but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities. In fact, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation, something they would have certainly found noteworthy. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having &quot;common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy&quot;; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other religion was considered to share parallels in teaching styles with the Muslim faith?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Makdisi accused of doing when evaluating the parallels between European and Islamic schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">overstating his case</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the European version of fiqh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">civil law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do scholars believe is the reason for similarities between Islamic and European schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parallel occurrence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prior to the 12th century, women accounted for less than one percent of the world’s Islamic scholars.

This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: &quot;Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity.&quot; İnalcık also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. Hence, this reveals that similar to today's modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and that the world was more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of &quot;schooling&quot; was also similar to today's modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by Mehmed the Conqueror. He built eight madaris that were built &quot;on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these.&quot; The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who traveled abroad to get an education at madaris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ottomans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many madaris were started by Mehmed the Conqueror?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How would a student matriculate to the next level of schooling in the Ottoman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">complete the classes in the lower one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were Ottoman madaris built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">near mosques</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first Ottoman madrasa built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1331</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. &quot;The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.&quot; Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As İnalcık mentions: &quot;Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.&quot; However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. &quot;The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths&quot; – key word being &quot;divine&quot;. İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.&quot; Hence, madaris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe &quot;Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.&quot; Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach &quot;proper religious values.&quot; This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the essential mission of Islamic schools in the Ottoman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spiritual learning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was philosophy taught in Ottoman madaris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">confirm the doctrines of Islam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of social structure did the Ottoman Empire have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pluralistic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion was at the center of education in the Ottoman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ottoman madaris have that was similar to modern American schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wide range of studies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As with any other country during the Early Modern Period, such as Italy and Spain in Europe, the Ottoman social life was interconnected with the medrese. Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes, such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens, were held under the infrastructure of a mosque, which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period. &quot;The mosques to which medreses were attached, dominated the social life in Ottoman cities.&quot; Social life was not dominated by religion only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period. As Goffman says: &quot;Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans, churches and synagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well.&quot; Hence, social life and the medrese were closely linked, since medreses taught many curricula, such as religion, which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy. &quot;They tried moving their developing state toward Islamic orthodoxy.&quot; Overall, the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy. Hence, medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of social service was provided through the madaris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aid to the poor through soup kitchens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had a hold over social life in the Ottoman Empire as well as other cultures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did students learn about religious and social norms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medreses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What practice was desired through connecting religion and schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamic orthodoxy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In India the majority of these schools follow the Hanafi school of thought.

Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE 'O' Levels like their peers.

The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudong for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state.
