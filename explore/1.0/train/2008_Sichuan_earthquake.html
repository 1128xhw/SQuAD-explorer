It was the deadliest earthquake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed at least 240,000 people, and the strongest in the country since the 1950 Chayu earthquake, which registered at 8.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. It is the 21st deadliest earthquake of all time.

Geng, while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community, believed that &quot;the bigger the earthquake, the easier it is to predict.&quot; Geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes; Premier Zhou Enlai reportedly took an interest in Geng's work. Geng's drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972, and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976 Tangshan earthquakes. The same Yazhou Zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes. In response, an official with the Seismological Bureau stated that &quot;earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint.&quot; The official also denied that the Seismological Bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the confidential written report sent to the State Seismological Bureau?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 30, 2008</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Geng's drought-earthquake correlation theory released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1972</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did researcher Geng Qingguo say was sent to the State Seismological Bureau?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">written report</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did this report warn about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">significant earthquake in Ngawa Prefecture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the predicted time of the quake?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">around May 8</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Geng long try to establish as a relationship with earthquakes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">droughts </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did an official with the Seismological Bureau deny receiving?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reports predicting the earthquake</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In a United States Geological Survey (USGS) study, preliminary rupture models of the earthquake indicated displacement of up to 9 meters along a fault approximately 240 km long by 20 km deep.

He pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake. Teruyuki Kato, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo, said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central China.

The Yingxiu liedu-XI zone is about 66 km long and 20 km wide along Wenchuan–Dujiangyan–Pengzhou; the Beichuan liedu-XI zone is about 82 km long and 15 km wide along An County–Beichuan–Pingwu. The area with liedu X (comparable to X on EMS, &quot;destructive&quot; and X on MM, &quot;disastrous&quot;) spans 3,144 km2. The area affected by earthquakes exceeding liedu VI totals 440,442 km2, occupying an oval 936 km long and 596 km wide, spanning three provinces and one autonomous region.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who published the map of the earthquakes intensity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CEA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the intensity scaled at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">XI</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the China Seismic Intensity Scale call the earthquake?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">very destructive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the USGS rate the earthquake?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">very disastrous</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What town was closest to the main epicenter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yingxiu, Wenchuan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Longmen Shan Fault System is situated in the eastern border of the Tibetan Plateau and contains several faults.

Due to the one-child policy, many families lost their only child when schools in the region collapsed during the earthquake. Consequently, Sichuan provincial and local officials have lifted the restriction for families whose only child was either killed or severely injured in the disaster. So-called &quot;illegal children&quot; under 18 years of age may be registered as legal replacements for their dead siblings; if the dead child was illegal, no further outstanding fines would apply.
