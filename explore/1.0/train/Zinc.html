It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the symbol for Zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Zn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the atomic number for Zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is zinc chemically close to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">magnesium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the oxidation state for zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">+2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many stable isotopes does zinc have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the symbol for zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is zinc's atomic number?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other element on the periodic table is zinc similar to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">magnesium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common zinc ore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sphalerite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used to extract zinc during the production process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electricity </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece.

Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys, such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who named the element zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paracelsus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was zinc named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zinke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is credited with discovering zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andreas Sigismund Marggraf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two people discovered the electrochemical properties of zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can you find zinc chloride?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deodorants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is credited as giving zinc its name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paracelsus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the name zinc or zinke mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">(prong, tooth)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered pure metallic zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andreas Sigismund Marggraf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common use for zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">(hot-dip galvanizing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a common use for zinc chloride?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deodorant</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of &quot;exceptional biologic and public health importance&quot;, especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development.

The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C. Above 210 °C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 °C) and boiling points (907 °C).

Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period.

Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does organozinc chemisty describe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">physical properties, synthesis and reactions.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the zinc equivalent of the Grinard reaction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> The Barbier reaction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When will organomagnesium halide formation fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">presence of just about any water</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are dimethylzinc, dietylzinc and diphenylzinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Commercially available diorganozinc compounds</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers, twists and clusters.
