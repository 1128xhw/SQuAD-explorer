Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the sobriquet &quot;the grandmother of Europe&quot;. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered.

Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called &quot;Kensington System&quot;, an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash. Her lessons included French, German, Italian, and Latin, but she spoke only English at home.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was extremely protective over Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What system of rules kept her isolated from other children?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kensington System</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Dutchess' rumored lover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Victoria's dog's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dash</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During her free time, what did she play with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dolls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Victoria share a bedroom with when she was a child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What languages did Victoria take lessons in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French, German, Italian, and Latin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the only language Victoria spoke at home?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Victoria's mothers lover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the formal name given to the system of rules Victoria was raised under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kensington System</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What system did Victorias mother raise her under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kensington System</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Victorias mothers comptroller?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was rumored to be Victorias mothers lover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Duchess's suspected lover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Victoria's childhood dog?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dash</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Kensington System?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Victoria describe her childhood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rather melancholy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What languages did Victoria study?

Victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child, Beatrice, despite opposition from members of the clergy, who considered it against biblical teaching, and members of the medical profession, who thought it dangerous. Victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression after many of her pregnancies. Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control.

Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for &quot;wickedly&quot; estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, the Prince of Wales, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been &quot;killed by that dreadful business&quot;, she said. She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years.

On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday, 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.

The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Queen commission Sir Robert Peel to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to form a new ministry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Melbourne resign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1839</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party was Sir Robert Peel a part of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of crisis where the wives of the Tories were replacing the wives of the Whigs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bedchamber crisis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Melbourne resign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1839</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who voted against the bill to end the constitution of Jamaica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Radicals and Tories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Queen commission to form a new ministry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Robert Peel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who returned to office after Peel resigned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Melbourne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The removal of the Queens bedchamber ladies became known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the bedchamber crisis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who resigned their position in 1839?

She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at château d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances. Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two countries was Victoria trying to improve relations between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France and Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the House of Orleans and the British Royal family related?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by marriage through the Coburgs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Victoria stay with in Normandy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Louis Philippe I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Victoria first visit Ireland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1849</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Louis Philippe visit England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1844</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two countries did Victoria take a large interest in improving relations between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France and Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Victorias first visit to Ireland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1849</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen Victoria set up meetings between The Britian royal family and what house to help improve relations between Britain and France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Orleans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the King of Normandy that Victoria and Albert stayed with in 1843 and 1845?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Louis Philippe I </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first French King to visit Queen Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Louis Philippe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first French king to visit Queen Victoria?

In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. &quot;Everyone likes flattery,&quot; he said, &quot;and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.&quot; With the phrase &quot;we authors, Ma'am&quot;, he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were &quot;a public meeting rather than a woman&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who died in 1865?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palmerston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who resigned in 1868?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Derby</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was Disraeli in office?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">matter of months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Disraeli's rival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Ewart Gladstone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What political view did Gladstone hold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liberal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Palmerston die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1865</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who let the ministry for a very short time after the death of Palmerston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who returned to power after Russels brief rule of the ministry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Derby</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Following Alberts death, what was the first year that Victoria attended the State opening of Parliment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1866</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced Derby after his resignation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benjamin Disraeli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Pamerston die? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1865</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event did Victoria attend in 1866 for the first time following Albert's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">State Opening of Parliament</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Act by Victoria granted the ability to vote to working men, but not women? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Reform Act 1867</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced Derby when he resigned in 1868? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benjamin Disraeli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Liberal replaced Disraeli after only a few short months in office? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Ewart Gladstone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Palmerston die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1865</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was ultimately returned to office after Palmerston's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Derby </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Derby resign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1868</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Derby's replacement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benjamin Disraeli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Disralei last in office?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only lasted a matter of months</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1887, the British Empire celebrated Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to &quot;Munshi&quot;: teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk.

Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, &quot;the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.&quot; Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war. In July, her second son Alfred (&quot;Affie&quot;) died; &quot;Oh, God!

She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired.

Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest. She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1830, what part of England did Victoria travel to with Dutchess of Kent and Conroy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the centre of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What town did Victoria visit in the center of England on her trip with the Dutchess of kent and Conroy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Malvern Hills</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years were journeys similar to the Queen trip to Melvern Hills made?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Willam was concerned that Victoria would was being portrayed as what because of her trips to central England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his rival</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was annoyed that Victoria was welcomed at each of her visits to central England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was annoyed at how well recieved Victoria was on her tours of the countryside of England and Wales? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Victoria become seriously ill during one of her trips? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ramsgate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Victoria dislike so much she banned him from her presence once she became Queen? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What position did Conroy try and fail to get Victoria to appoint him to during her illness and later? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">private secretary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took Victoria on a trip to Malvern Hills in 1830?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Duchess of Kent and Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Victoria convinced to make her secretery when she was very ill?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Conroy </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Victoria feel about all of the trips?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disliked</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What annoyed the King about the way Victoria was received at her stops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enthusiastically welcomed in each</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the King dislike Victoria taking the trips?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his riva</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When she was made Queen, what did Victoria do about Conroy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">banned him from her presence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the time of her accession, the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne, who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen, who relied on him for advice.

Brown died 10 days after her accident, and to the consternation of her private secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown. Ponsonby and Randall Davidson, Dean of Windsor, who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair. The manuscript was destroyed. In early 1884, Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands, a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her &quot;devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown&quot;. On the day after the first anniversary of Brown's death, Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son, Leopold, had died in Cannes. He was &quot;the dearest of my dear sons&quot;, she lamented. The following month, Victoria's youngest child, Beatrice, met and fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg at the wedding of Victoria's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine to Henry's brother Prince Louis of Battenberg. Beatrice and Henry planned to marry, but Victoria opposed the match at first, wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion. After a year, she was won around to the marriage by Henry and Beatrice's promise to remain living with and attending her.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Victoria fall down the stairs at Windsor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1883</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After her fall down the stairs, what health issue was Victoria plaged with thereafter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rheumatism thereafter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who died 10 days after Victorias fall down the stairs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was Victoria notified of her youngest son leopolds death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by telegram</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Victorias private secretary during the years following her accident at Windsor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Henry Ponsonby</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Queen Victoria get injured after taking a fall down some stairs? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 March 1883</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Queen Victoria write a biography about that was never published? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Victoria's youngest son, Leopold die? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cannes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Victoria initially opposed Beatrice's marriage to what man? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Henry of Battenberg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Beatrice meet and fall in love with Prince Henry? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at the wedding of Victoria's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused Victoria's rheumatism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">she fell down some stairs at Windsor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who died 10 days after Victoria's accident?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Victoria begin working on after Brown's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a eulogistic biography</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was opposed to Victoria writing a biography of Brown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Henry Ponsonby</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened in Victoria's life on the day after the one year anniversary of Brown's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her youngest son, Leopold, had died in Cannes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Victoria's youngest son, Leopold, was affected by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers.

The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers.

The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was riding in a carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the man that tried to shoot Queen Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Francis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Francis fail to kill Queen Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the gun did not fire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did John Francis try to shoot Queen Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">29 May 1842</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Queen Victoria when Francis tried to shoot her?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">riding in a carriage along The Mall, London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Francis after his attempt to shoot Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he escaped</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made two unsuccessful attempts on Queen Victoria's life in 1842?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> John Francis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was John Francis's eventual sentence for the attempt on the Queens life? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">transportation for life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who shot at Queen Victoria on July 3, days after John Francis's sentence was commuted? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> John William Bean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who fired a shot at Queen Victoria's carriage in 1849?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Hamilton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What person recieved a seven year transportation sentence for striking Victoria on the head with his cane? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Pate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who escaped Victoria's guards after attempting to fire a shot at her?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Francis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to John Francis after his second attempt to fire on the Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">death sentence was commuted to transportation for life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John William Bean try to fire at Queen Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paper and tobacco</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the consequences of John William Bean's attempt to fire at the Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18 months in jail</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did William Hamilton fire a powder charge at Victoria's carriage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1849</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen.

Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote, &quot;[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful.&quot; Alexander, on the other hand, was &quot;very plain&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Dutchesses brother Leopold was the King of what country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Belgians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Leopold become King of the Belgians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1831</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the nephew of leopold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Alberts father?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Victoria describe the physical appearance of Alexander?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">very plain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who disapproved of the proposed marriage between Victoria and Albert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William IV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the man William IV wanted Victoria to wed instead? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Alexander of the Netherlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prince Alexander was the second son of whom? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince of Orange</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Victoria think of her suiter, the Prince Alexander of Orange? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">very plain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Victoria feel about Albert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wanted to see Victoria and Albert marry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Duchess's brother, Leopold</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who opposed Victoria marrying Albert, or any Coburg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William IV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did William IV feel was a suitable husband for Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Alexander of the Netherlands</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the start of her reign Victoria was popular, but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings, developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy. Victoria believed the rumours. She hated Conroy, and despised &quot;that odious Lady Flora&quot;, because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System. At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually agreed, and was found to be a virgin. Conroy, the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora. When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen. At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as &quot;Mrs. Melbourne&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What health issue did Flora hastings develope that began to ruin Victorias reputation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an abdominal growth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the job of lady Flora Hastings in Victorias household?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Flora hastings abdominal growth rumored to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an out-of-wedlock pregnancy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was rumored to be the father of Flora Hastings &quot;pregnancy&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Victorias reputation begin to suffer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1839 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What lady in waiting was at the heart of a 1839 court scandal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lady Flora Hastings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the cause of Lady Flora's death in July? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large tumour on her liver</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With whom did Lady Flora consipire against Queen Victoria? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Conroy and the Duchess of Kent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Queen Victoria called after Lady Flora's death due?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mrs. Melbourne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who, in Victoria's court, was accused of having a pregnancy outside of mariage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was believed to be the father of Lady Flor's &quot;baby&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Conroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Victoria think of Lady Flora?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">despised </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Victoria hate Sir Conroy and Lady Flora?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Kensington System</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was actually the cause of Lady Flora's &quot;pregnancy&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1870, republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Third French Republic established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the republica rally held that called for Vuictorias removal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Trafalgar Square</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who spoke against Victoria at the rally in Trafalgar Square?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Radical MPs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1871, Victoria became seriously ill with an abscess on what part of her body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who lanced and treated the abscess on Queen Victorias arm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joseph Lister</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the republican sentiment in Britain changed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was a rally calling for Queen Victoria's removal held? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Trafalgar Square</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cutting edge treatment did Joseph Lister use to treat Queen Victoria's illness?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new antiseptic carbolic acid spray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What disease nearly took the Prince of Wales life? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">typhoid fever</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">WHat was a new antiseptic being used to treat abcesses in the 1870's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acid spray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What helped to boost the rebublicians in 1870?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">establishment of the Third French Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Third French Republic come onto the scene?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">WHat was a new antiseptic being used to treat abcesses in the 1870's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">carbolic acid spray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What disease was contracted by the Prince of Wales that nearly ended his life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">typhoid fever</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who spoke against Victoria at Trafalgar Square?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Radical MPs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After what event did the Prince of Wales' health begin to improve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the tenth anniversary of her husband's death</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason and found guilty, but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Queen Victorias first pregnancy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1840</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who attempted to assasinate Victoria while she was riding in a carriage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward Oxford</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Edward Oxford?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was riding in the carriage with Victoria when Oxford attempted to assasinate her?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Albert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did Oxford fire the gun at Victoria and miss?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to assassinate Queen Victoria while she was pregnant with her first child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward Oxford</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had how many more children after Victoria's birth? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Queen Victoria's first daughter born? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21 November 1840</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Albert Edward, Queen Victoria's first born son born? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1841</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What major life event was Victoria facing when she also had to contend with her first assassination attempt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">first pregnancy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Victoria's first assassination attempt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1840</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the first assassination attempt do for Victoria's reign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">popularity soared</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Edward Oxford charged with after his assassination attempt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high treason</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Edward Oxford to after he was found guilty of high treason?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acquitted on the grounds of insanity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Between April 1877 and February 1878, she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo-Turkish War, but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin.

A painting by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer depicting the Queen with Brown was exhibited at the Royal Academy, and Victoria published a book, Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands, which featured Brown prominently and in which the Queen praised him highly.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the manservent that Victoria had in the 1860's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was John brown, Victorias manservant, from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scotland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of a connection was rumored to exist between Victoria and John Brown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a romantic connection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nickname given to Queen Victoria when rumors of a relationship with John Brown arose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mrs. Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the 1997 movie depicting the relationship between Victoria and John brown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mrs. Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country was Queen Victoria's manservant with whom she was rumored to have a romantic interest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scotland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the movie that told the story of Queen Victoria's romance with John Brown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mrs. Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artist painted the Queen and Brown which hung in the Royal Academy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Edwin Henry Landseer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what memior written by Queen Victoria was John Brown praised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which manservent was Victoria's most trusted ally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which movie was made about the scandalous affair that Victoria was believed to have had with John Brown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mrs. Brown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which book did Victoria publish that did nothing to take away from the rumors about her and John Brown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Queen feature in her book that drew so much criticism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Brown</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood, Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

As Victoria's monarchy became more symbolic than political, it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values, in contrast to the sexual, financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy.

After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them.
