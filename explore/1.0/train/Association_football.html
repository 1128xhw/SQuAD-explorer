An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup. Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football. As with pre-codified &quot;mob football&quot;, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking. Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan, chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Museum has a vase with an image of an episkyros player?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Archaeological Museum of Athens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What game did Athenaeus reference in 228 AD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">harpastum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of a similar, non-competitive game in Japan called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kemari </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country is the game chuck-guk from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Korea </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country is the game wogabaliri from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso to do so instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Football Association arrange The Laws of the Game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1863</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who Organizes the World Cups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> International Federation of Association Football</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many years between World Cups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did the Laws of the Game come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">goalkeepers </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Association football in itself does not have a classical history. Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA have recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century does football in England date back to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> eighth century AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization has said that there is no historical connection to association football with any other game outside of Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FIFA </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the modern rules of association football come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did kids play football in public schools in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which rules were influential to the codes of association football?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cambridge Rules</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which college where the Cambridge Rules written at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Trinity College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did John Charles Thring come up with rules that were influential?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1862</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Sheffield FA form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1867</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year were the Cambridge Rules first drawn up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1848</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only position specified by the Laws of the Game</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">goalkeeper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The focus of strikers and forwards are to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">score goals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> A team players layout is a what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's job is to prevent the opponents from scoring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">defenders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's the most responsible for the teams tactics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">team's manager</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London. The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game. These rules included handling of the ball by &quot;marks&quot; and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Football Association form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1863</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what establishment did the Football Association have their first Meeting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Freemasons' Tavern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Rugby Football Union form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1871</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many clubs ended up ratifying the original laws of the game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eleven </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who played by their own rules till the 1870's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Sheffield FA </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C.

R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games.

By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2006, which team helps secure a truce during a civil war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Côte d'Ivoire </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city did a peaceful match between two armies take place in 2007?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bouaké</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Football War happen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> June 1969</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Football made which wars more tense in the 1990's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yugoslav Wars </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions.

Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90 minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many periods are in a standard football match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long are each period in a standard football match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">45 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the periods in a football match called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">halves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gets to decide how long stoppage time can go on for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">referee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did an incident help introduce added time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1891 </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In league competitions, games may end in a draw.
