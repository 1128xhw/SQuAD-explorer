It is the color of living grass and leaves and as a result is the color most associated with springtime, growth and nature. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which old english word does the word &quot;green&quot; originate from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grene</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than &quot;grass&quot;, what other Germanic root word is similar to green?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which season is green most commonly associated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">springtime</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which chemical in plants is the largest contributor to the color green?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chlorophyll</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What an is an example of a green mineral?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emerald</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What, in nature, is most likely to make things green?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chlorophyll</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what do some animals use the color green?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">camouflage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What chemical causes emeralds to be green?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chromium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From which Middle English and Anglo-Saxon word is green derived?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grene</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In surveys made in Europe and the United States, green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope and envy. In Europe and the U.S. green is sometimes associated with death (green has several seemingly contrary associations), sickness, or the devil, but in China its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. It is the most important color in Islam. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries, and represents the lush vegetation of Paradise. It is also often associated with the culture of Gaelic Ireland, and is a color of the flag of Ireland. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is green a symbol of in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fertility and happiness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the Middle Ages, which color was associated with merchants, bankers, and the gentry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">green</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Mona Lisa wearing green symbolize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">she is not from a noble family</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the color green represent in the flags of Islamic countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lush vegetation of Paradise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is green the color of the environmental movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its association with nature</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Thus, the languages mentioned above (Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Greek) have old terms for &quot;green&quot; which are derived from words for fresh, sprouting vegetation.

In more contemporary terms, they are 藍 (lán, in Mandarin) and 綠 (lǜ, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, 緑 (midori, which is derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb midoru &quot;to be in leaf, to flourish&quot; in reference to trees) and グリーン (guriin, which is derived from the English word &quot;green&quot;). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors that other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, &quot;aoi&quot;, because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green shiso (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word &quot;aoi&quot;.

(See distinction of green from blue) These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote &quot;green&quot;, but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms (much like the English adjective orange being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit).

Green laser pointers outputting at 532 nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064 nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532 nm (&quot;green&quot;). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501 nm to 543 nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543 nm), the Argon-ion laser (514 nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521 nm and 531 nm), as well as liquid dye lasers.

The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar.

The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by Pliny. It was used by the Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. Leonardo da Vinci, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is made by placing a plate of blade of copper, brass, or bronze into vat of fermenting wine for several weeks, then scraping off and drying the green powder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Verdigris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who described the process of making verdigris in ancient times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pliny</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city did the Romans use verdigris in murals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pompeii</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would verdigris do to other colors that it came in contact with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ruin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which famous artist warned other artists not to use verdigris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leonardo da Vinci</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is no natural source for green food colorings which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin.

Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do animals typically use the color green?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">camouflage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a chemical that can cause green hue in birds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turacoverdin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a protein that carries copper ions in chelation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ceruloplasmin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the green pigment in bile called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biliverdin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is no green pigment in green eyes; like the color of blue eyes, it is an optical illusion; its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma, given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin, with the blue tone imparted by the Rayleigh scattering of the reflected light. Green eyes are most common in Northern and Central Europe. They can also be found in Southern Europe, West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia.
