Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh &quot;Freddie&quot; Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested &quot;Queen&quot; as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. Their performance at 1985's Live Aid is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications, with a 2005 industry poll ranking it the best. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have occasionally performed together, including with Paul Rodgers (2004–09) and with Adam Lambert (since 2011). In November 2014, Queen released a new album, Queen Forever, featuring vocals from the late Mercury.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Brian May and Roger Taylor's band before Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Smile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the stage name adopted by Farrokh Bulsara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Freddie Mercury</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the album Queen released in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Forever</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Queen's 1977 album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">News of the World</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Freddie Mercury die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While attending Ealing Art College, Tim Staffell became friends with Farrokh Bulsara, a fellow student who had assumed the English name of Freddie. Bulsara felt that he and the band had the same tastes and soon became a keen fan of Smile. In late 1970, after Staffell left to join the band Humpy Bong, the remaining Smile members, encouraged by Bulsara, changed their name to &quot;Queen&quot; and continued working together. When asked about the name, Bulsara explained, &quot;I thought up the name Queen. It's just a name, but it's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tim Staffell left the band Smile in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What band did Tim Staffell join after leaving Smile?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Humpy Bong</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the college Tim Staffell attended when he met Farrokh Bulsara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Ealing Art College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Smile change their name to Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the English first name Farrokh Bulsara adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Freddie</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The band had a number of bass players during this period who did not fit with the band's chemistry. It was not until February 1971 that they settled on John Deacon and began to rehearse for their first album. They recorded four of their own songs, &quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot;, for a demo tape; no record companies were interested. It was also around this time Freddie changed his surname to &quot;Mercury&quot;, inspired by the line &quot;Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me&quot; in the song &quot;My Fairy King&quot;. On 2 July 1971, Queen played their first show in the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John Deacon played what instrument?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did John Deacon join Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Freddie from Queen change his last name to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mercury</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song inspired Freddie from Queen's surname?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">My Fairy King</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Queen play their first show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2 July 1971</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Having attended art college, Mercury also designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the first album cover, was a simple line drawing but more intricate colour versions were used on later sleeves.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed Queen's logo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mercury</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Freddie Mercury's zodiac sign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Virgo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which zodiac sign did Deacon and Taylor share?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Leo </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Brian May's zodiac sign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cancer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The early Queen logo resembled the coat of arms of what country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1972, Queen entered discussions with Trident Studios after being spotted at De La Lane Studios by John Anthony and after discussions were offered a management deal by Norman Sheffield under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident to manage the band and enable them to use the facilities at Trident to record new material whilst the management search for a record label to sign Queen. This suited both parties at the time as Trident were expanding into management and Queen under the deal were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities shared by bands at the time such as the Beatles and Elton John to produce new material. However, Trident found it difficult to find a label for a band bearing a name with such connotation during the early 1970s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who offered Queen a management deal in 1972?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Norman Sheffield </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which singer used Trident studios in addition to Queen and the Beatles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elton John</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Trident's subsidiary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neptune Productions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Queen spotted before entering discussions with Trident?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> De La Lane Studios</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Queen enter discussions with Trident studios?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1972</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In July 1973, Queen finally under a Trident/EMI deal released their eponymous debut album, an effort influenced by the heavy metal and progressive rock of the day. The album was received well by critics; Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone said &quot;their debut album is superb&quot;, and Chicago's Daily Herald called it an &quot;above average debut&quot;. It drew little mainstream attention, and the lead single &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, a Brian May composition, sold poorly. Retrospectively, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; is cited as the highlight of the album, and in 2008 Rolling Stone ranked it 31st in the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song&quot;.

This image would be used as the basis for the 1975 &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; music video production. The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK. The Freddie Mercury-written lead single &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; reached number ten in the UK, giving the band their first hit. The album is the first real testament to the band's distinctive layered sound, and features long complex instrumental passages, fantasy-themed lyrics, and musical virtuosity. Aside from its only single, the album also included the song &quot;The March of the Black Queen&quot;, a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus. The Daily Vault described the number as &quot;menacing&quot;. Critical reaction was mixed; the Winnipeg Free Press, while praising the band's debut album, described Queen II as a &quot;over-produced monstrosity&quot;. Allmusic has described the album as a favourite among the band's hardcore fans, and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Queen's second LP?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Queen's second album released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1974</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the cover of Queen's second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mick Rock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the song Seven Seas of Rhye?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Freddie Mercury</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is the song The March of the Black Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> six-minute</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the band's six-night stand at New York's Uris Theatre in May 1974, Brian May collapsed and was diagnosed as having hepatitis. While recuperating, May was initially absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process. Released in 1974, Sheer Heart Attack reached number two in the United Kingdom, sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the United States. It gave the band their first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including British music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and Caribbean. At this point, Queen started to move away from the progressive tendencies of their first two releases into a more radio-friendly, song-orientated style. Sheer Heart Attack introduced new sound and melody patterns that would be refined on their next album, A Night at the Opera.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Brian May diagnosed with after collapsing in 1974?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hepatitis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Queen's third album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sheer Heart Attack</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Queen album was released after Sheer Heart Attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Night at the Opera</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen's Sheer Heart Attack reached what number on the United Kingdom charts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the venue where Brian May collapsed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New York's Uris Theatre</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The single &quot;Killer Queen&quot; from Sheer Heart Attack reached number two on the British charts, and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The album's second single, &quot;Now I'm Here&quot;, a more traditional hard rock composition, was a number eleven hit in Britain, while the high speed rocker &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; featuring May's uptempo riffs is a precursor to speed metal. In recent years, the album has received acclaim from music publications: In 2006, Classic Rock ranked it number 28 in &quot;The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever&quot;, and in 2007, Mojo ranked it No.88 in &quot;The 100 Records That Changed the World&quot;.

At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In &quot;The Prophet's Song&quot;, an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time. A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists reflecting the opinions of critics. Among other accolades, it was ranked number 16 in Q Magazine's &quot;The 50 Best British Albums Ever&quot; in 2004, and number 11 in Rolling Stone's &quot;The 100 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; as featured in their Mexican edition in 2004. It was also placed at No. 230 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003.

Mercury's close friend and advisor, Capital London radio DJ Kenny Everett, played a pivotal role in giving the single exposure. It is the third-best-selling single of all time in the UK, surpassed only by Band Aid's &quot;Do They Know It's Christmas?&quot; and Elton John's &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;, and is the best-selling commercial single in the UK. It also reached number nine in the United States (a 1992 re-release reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks). It is the only single ever to sell a million copies on two separate occasions, and became the Christmas number one twice in the UK, the only single ever to do so. &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; has been voted numerous times the greatest song of all time. The band decided to make a video to help go with the single and hired Trilion, a subsidiary of the former management company Trident Studios, using new technology to create the video; the result is generally considered to have been the first &quot;true&quot; music video ever produced, and popularised the medium. The album's first track &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot; is said to be written by Mercury about Norman Sheffield and the former management at Trident who helped make the video so popular. Although other bands, including the Beatles, had made short promotional films or videos of songs prior to this, generally, those were specifically made to be aired on specific television shows. On the impact of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, Rolling Stone states: &quot;Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.&quot; The second single from the album, &quot;You're My Best Friend&quot;, the second song composed by John Deacon, and his first single, peaked at number sixteen in the United States and went on to become a worldwide Top Ten hit. The band's A Night at the Opera Tour began in November 1975, and covered Europe, the United States, Japan, and Australia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Queen song was number one on the UK charts for nine weeks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bohemian Rhapsody</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the third best selling single of all time in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bohemian Rhapsody</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Queen single sold a million copies on two separate occasions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bohemian Rhapsody</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Queen's A Night at the Opera Tour begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1975</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen's 1975 tour included Europe and what three countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> United States, Japan, and Australia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording A Day at the Races, which is often regarded as a sequel album to A Night at the Opera. It again borrowed the name of a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of A Night at the Opera, a variation on the same Queen Crest. The most recognisable of the Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home in March 1977; there the band thanked him in person, and performed &quot;'39&quot; a cappella. Musically, A Day at the Races was by both fans' and critics' standards a strong effort, reaching number one in the UK and Japan, and number five in the US. The major hit on the album was &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, a gospel-inspired song in which Mercury, May, and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to create a 100-voice gospel choir. The song went to number two in the UK, and number thirteen in the US. The album also featured one of the band's heaviest songs, May's &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, which became a staple of their live shows.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Queen album was released in 1976?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> A Day at the Races</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the major hit from Queen's 1976 album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Somebody to Love</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which heavy Queen song is a favorite at live shows?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tie Your Mother Down</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which comedian invited Queen to visit him in 1977? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Groucho Marx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Queen members layered their voices on Somebody to Love?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mercury, May, and Taylor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During 1976, Queen played one of their most famous gigs, a free concert in Hyde Park, London.

The song made the top 10 in many countries, topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks, and was the band's first number one single in the United States where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he ever played guitar in concert.

The album topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive &quot;No Synthesisers!&quot; sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-&quot;hard&quot;-rock stance by the band, but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time. In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon. At the 1981 American Music Awards in January, &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single, and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen performed several sold out shows at what US venue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madison Square Garden</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen recorded the soundtrack to what show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Flash Gordon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Queen song won the award for best Pop/Rock single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Another One Bites the Dust</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which musical artist suggested Queen release Another One Bites the Dust as a single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Michael Jackson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Queen album kicked off the 1980s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Game</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In February 1981, Queen travelled to South America as part of The Game Tour, and became the first major rock band to play in Latin American stadiums.

May was also scathing of Prenter, who was Mercury's manager from the early 1980s to 1984, for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations, such as the US networks, and their vital connection between the artist and the community, and for denying them access to Mercury. The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth season premiere of Saturday Night Live.

The band also played behind the Iron Curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 at the Népstadion in Budapest, in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe. More than one million people saw Queen on the tour—400,000 in the United Kingdom alone, a record at the time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen's final tour with Freddie Mercury was in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1986</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Queen's final tour with Freddie Mercury?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Kind of Magic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many fans saw Queen in Knebworth park?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 120,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many fans saw Queen at the Nepstadion in Budapest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many fans saw Queen at Slane castle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">95,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After working on various solo projects during 1988 (including Mercury's collaboration with Montserrat Caballé, Barcelona), the band released The Miracle in 1989. The album continued the direction of A Kind of Magic, using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers. It spawned the European hits &quot;I Want It All&quot;, &quot;Breakthru&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;Scandal&quot;, and &quot;The Miracle&quot;. The Miracle also began a change in direction of Queen's songwriting philosophy. Since the band's beginning, nearly all songs had been written by and credited to a single member, with other members adding minimally. With The Miracle, the band's songwriting became more collaborative, and they vowed to credit the final product only to Queen as a group.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Freddie Mercury collaborate with in 1988?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Montserrat Caballé, Barcelona</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Queen release The Miracle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1989</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Queen album had more shared writing credits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Miracle</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, rumours began to spread that Mercury was suffering from AIDS. Mercury flatly denied this, insisting he was merely &quot;exhausted&quot; and too busy to provide interviews. The band decided to continue making albums, starting with The Miracle in 1989 and continuing with Innuendo in 1991. Despite his deteriorating health, the lead singer continued to contribute. For the last two albums made while Mercury was still alive, the band credited all songs to Queen, rather than specific members of the group, freeing them of internal conflict and differences. In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with Disney's Hollywood Records, which has since remained the group's music catalogue owner in the United States and Canada. That same year, Mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Queen end their contract with Capitol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After leaving Capitol, who did Queen sign with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Disney's Hollywood Records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Freddie Mercury's final public appearance with Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Queen album was released in 1991?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Innuendo </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Innuendo was released in early 1991 with an eponymous number 1 UK hit and other charting singles including, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.

Because of this, May had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury's successful performance May states; &quot;he went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal&quot;. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come in to the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May says of Mercury: “He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.’ He had no fear, really.” The band's second greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits II, followed in October 1991, which is the eighth best-selling album of all time in the UK and has sold 16 million copies worldwide.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one single from Queen's Innuendo that charted in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Show Must Go On</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Queen's second greatest hits compilation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Greatest Hits II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Queen album is the eighth best-selling album in the UK of all time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greatest Hits II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which band member of Queen was seriously ill in 1991?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mercury </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen's Greatest Hits II has sold how many copies worldwide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 16 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 23 November 1991, in a prepared statement made on his deathbed, Mercury confirmed that he had AIDS.

His funeral service on 27 November in Kensal Green, West London was private, and held in accordance with the Zoroastrian religious faith of his family. &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was re-released as a single shortly after Mercury's death, with &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; as the double A-side. The music video for &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; contains Mercury's final scenes in front of the camera. The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks – the only recording to top the Christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years (1975, 1976, 1991, and 1992).

The album also featured the song &quot;Mother Love&quot;, the last vocal recording Mercury made prior to his death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he &quot;wasn't feeling that great&quot; and stated, &quot;I will finish it when I come back, next time&quot;; however, he never made it back into the studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland.

The album contains 20 of Queen's biggest hits spanning their entire career and was released in four different formats: single disc, double disc (with commentary), double disc with feature book, and a vinyl record. Prior to its release, a competition was run by Queen online to guess the track listing as a promotion for the album.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On 20 May 2009 which Queen members performed We are the Champions on American Idol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May and Taylor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Greatest Hits compilation Queen released after the split from Paul Rodgers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Absolute Greatest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two American idol contestants performed a duet with Queen on American Idol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What day in 2009 was Queen's Absolute Greatest released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16 November</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 30 October 2009, May wrote a fanclub letter on his website stating that Queen had no intentions to tour in 2010 but that there was a possibility of a performance. He was quoted as saying, &quot;The greatest debate, though, is always about when we will next play together as Queen. At the moment, in spite of the many rumours that are out there, we do not have plans to tour in 2010. The good news, though, is that Roger and I have a much closer mutual understanding these days—privately and professionally ... and all ideas are carefully considered. Music is never far away from us. As I write, there is an important one-off performance on offer, in the USA, and it remains to be decided whether we will take up this particular challenge. Every day, doors seem to open, and every day, we interact, perhaps more than ever before, with the world outside. It is a time of exciting transition in Rock music and in 'The Business'. It's good that the pulse still beats&quot;.

Several Queen songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;.

Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer Roy Thomas Baker, and their engineer Mike Stone. Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

A Night at the Opera was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album's original release (CD+DVD-Video set). In 2007, a Blu-ray edition of Queen's previously released concerts, Queen Rock Montreal &amp; Live Aid, was released, marking their first project in 1080p HD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen's Live at Wembley Stadium DVD covered what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1986 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Queen on Fire included this 1982 concert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Milton Keynes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Queen's A Night at the Opera re-released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first Queen Bluray released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which band members were involved in the restoration of Queen's prior projects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May and Taylor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Queen have been featured multiple times in the Guitar Hero franchise: a cover of &quot;Killer Queen&quot; in the original Guitar Hero, &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, and the Paul Rodgers collaboration &quot;C-lebrity&quot; in a track pack for Guitar Hero World Tour, &quot;Under Pressure&quot; with David Bowie in Guitar Hero 5, &quot;I Want It All&quot; in Guitar Hero: Van Halen, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; in Guitar Hero: Metallica, and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock.

Time commented with approval on his singing ability and visual similarity to Mercury. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen dropped out of the role due to &quot;creative differences&quot; between him and the surviving band members. In December 2013, it was announced that Ben Whishaw, best known for playing Q in the James Bond film Skyfall, had been chosen to replace Cohen in the role of Mercury. The motion picture is being written by Peter Morgan, who had been nominated for Oscars for his screenplays The Queen and Frost/Nixon. The film, which is being co-produced by Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions, will focus on Queen's formative years and the period leading up to the celebrated performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was originally chosen to play Freddie Mercury in the movie bearing his name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sacha Baron Cohen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the replacement to play Freddie Mercury in the film of the same name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ben Whishaw</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is writing the Freddie Mercury film?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peter Morgan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which actor is producing the Freddie Mercury film?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert De Niro</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Queen perform at Live Aid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1985</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
