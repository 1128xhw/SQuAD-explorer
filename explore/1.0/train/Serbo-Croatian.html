The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, Shtokavian became the most widespread in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian (which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest). Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as &quot;Slavic&quot;, &quot;Illyrian&quot;, or according to region, &quot;Bosnian&quot;, &quot;Serbian&quot; and &quot;Croatian&quot;, the latter often in combination with &quot;Slavonian&quot; or &quot;Dalmatian&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the main causes of the turbulent history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">expansion of the Ottoman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main cause of the spread of Shtokavian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">population migrations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which geographical region did Shtokavian become wide spread?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">western Balkans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the major differences between the Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is &quot;Illyrian?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were some of the names given to language during period of foreign control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Slavic&quot;, &quot;Illyrian&quot;, or according to region, &quot;Bosnian&quot;, &quot;Serbian&quot; and &quot;Croatian&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What specific historical event caused a group of religious and verbal differences in South Slavic dialect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> expansion of the Ottoman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Shtokavian the most widespread culture in the western Balkans? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">population migrations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Serbo-Croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established. From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called &quot;Serbo-Croato-Slovenian&quot;), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the ethnic names Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and sometimes Montenegrin and Bunjevac.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which time period was Serbo-Croatian standardized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-19th-century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the document that standardized Serbo-Croatian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vienna Literary Agreement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were both Serbian and Croatian standards based off of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eastern Herzegovinian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Serbo-Croatian the official language for in the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which additional language was added as an official language after the breakup of Yugoslavia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bosnian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were both Serbian and Croation standards based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which language officially served the Kingdom of Yugoslavia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Serbo-Croatian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ethnic names does Serbo-Croatian associate with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and sometimes Montenegrin and Bunjevac</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Like other South Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian has a simple phonology, with the common five-vowel system and twenty-five consonants.

Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called &quot;Illyric&quot;, &quot;Slavic&quot;, &quot;Slavonian&quot;, &quot;Bosnian&quot;, &quot;Dalmatian&quot;, &quot;Serbian&quot; or &quot;Croatian&quot;. As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language &quot;Serbian&quot; or &quot;Croatian&quot;, respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, &quot;Bosnian&quot;, &quot;Croatian&quot;, and &quot;Serbian&quot; were considered to be three names of a single official language. Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988, claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European, Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language, but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits (‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’). Today, use of the term &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match. It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative, though alternative names have been used, such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS), which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the term Serbo-Croatian first used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1824</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who popularized the term Serbo-Croatian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jernej Kopitar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aside from the Ottoman Empire, which other empire did the Serb and Croat lands in the mid 19th century belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austrian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which region of land was the Serbo-Croat language referred to as &quot;Bosnian&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bosnia and Herzegovina</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a political text where the term Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian was used to describe the language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hague War Crimes tribunal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did South Slav languages develop coherently or independently?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">independently</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the names given to the various dialects predating the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> &quot;Illyric&quot;, &quot;Slavic&quot;, &quot;Slavonian&quot;, &quot;Bosnian&quot;, &quot;Dalmatian&quot;, &quot;Serbian&quot; or &quot;Croatian&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first used the term Serbo-Croatian in 1824?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jacob Grimm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what reason is the term &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; controversial today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prejudice that nation and language must match</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the mid-19th century, Serbian (led by self-taught writer and folklorist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić) and most Croatian writers and linguists (represented by the Illyrian movement and led by Ljudevit Gaj and Đuro Daničić), proposed the use of the most widespread dialect, Shtokavian, as the base for their common standard language. Karadžić standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, and Gaj and Daničić standardized the Croatian Latin alphabet, on the basis of vernacular speech phonemes and the principle of phonological spelling. In 1850 Serbian and Croatian writers and linguists signed the Vienna Literary Agreement, declaring their intention to create a unified standard. Thus a complex bi-variant language appeared, which the Serbs officially called &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; or &quot;Serbian or Croatian&quot; and the Croats &quot;Croato-Serbian&quot;, or &quot;Croatian or Serbian&quot;. Yet, in practice, the variants of the conceived common literary language served as different literary variants, chiefly differing in lexical inventory and stylistic devices. The common phrase describing this situation was that Serbo-Croatian or &quot;Croatian or Serbian&quot; was a single language. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the language of all three nations was called &quot;Bosnian&quot; until the death of administrator von Kállay in 1907, at which point the name was changed to &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which dialect did writers and linguists of both Serbian and Croatian backgrounds wish to use as their common standard language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shtokavian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Shtokavian suggested as a common language base?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most widespread dialect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 1850 document formally declared the intent to create a unified standard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vienna Literary Agreement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After whose death in 1907 was the &quot;Bosnian&quot; name changed to &quot;Serbo-Creation&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">administrator von Kállay</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West European scientists judge the Yugoslav language policy as an exemplary one: although three-quarters of the population spoke one language, no single language was official on a federal level. Official languages were declared only at the level of constituent republics and provinces, and very generously: Vojvodina had five (among them Slovak and Romanian, spoken by 0.5 per cent of the population), and Kosovo four (Albanian, Turkish, Romany and Serbo-Croatian). Newspapers, radio and television studios used sixteen languages, fourteen were used as languages of tuition in schools, and nine at universities. Only the Yugoslav Army used Serbo-Croatian as the sole language of command, with all other languages represented in the army’s other activities—however, this is not different from other armies of multilingual states, or in other specific institutions, such as international air traffic control where English is used worldwide. All variants of Serbo-Croatian were used in state administration and republican and federal institutions. Both Serbian and Croatian variants were represented in respectively different grammar books, dictionaries, school textbooks and in books known as pravopis (which detail spelling rules). Serbo-Croatian was a kind of soft standardisation. However, legal equality could not dampen the prestige Serbo-Croatian had: since it was the language of three quarters of the population, it functioned as an unofficial lingua franca. And within Serbo-Croatian, the Serbian variant, with twice as many speakers as the Croatian, enjoyed greater prestige, reinforced by the fact that Slovene and Macedonian speakers preferred it to the Croatian variant because their languages are also Ekavian. This is a common situation in other pluricentric languages, e.g. the variants of German differ according to their prestige, the variants of Portuguese too. Moreover, all languages differ in terms of prestige: &quot;the fact is that languages (in terms of prestige, learnability etc.) are not equal, and the law cannot make them equal&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term used for books that lay out spelling rules?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pravopis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which language was that of 3/4 of the population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Serbo-Croatian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of the two Serbo-Croatian variants, which had twice as many speakers as the other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Serbian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Like most Slavic languages, there are mostly three genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike Russian and, in part, the Čakavian dialect).

In the discussion, she shows that linguistic criteria such as mutual intelligibility, huge overlap in linguistic system, and the same dialectic basis of standard language provide evidence that Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin are four national variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language. Igor Mandić states: &quot;During the last ten years, it has been the longest, the most serious and most acrid discussion (…) in 21st-century Croatian culture&quot;.

Their loyalty was first and foremost to Catholic Christendom, but when they professed an ethnic identity, they referred to themselves as &quot;Slovin&quot; and &quot;Illyrian&quot; (a sort of forerunner of Catholic baroque pan-Slavism) and Croat – these 30-odd writers over the span of c. 350 years always saw themselves as Croats first and never as part of a Serbian nation. It should also be noted that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia. A Croatian follower of Vuk Karadžić, Ivan Broz, noted that for a Dalmatian to identify oneself as a Serb was seen as foreign as identifying oneself as Macedonian or Greek.

The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which agreement was signed in 1954 by writers, linguists, and literary critics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Novi Sad Agreement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what principle did the Novi Sad Agreement focus upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">equal status</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was given the task of creating a dictionary in the Novi Sad Agreement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In addition, like most Slavic languages, the Shtokavian verb also has one of two aspects: perfective or imperfective.

Some Štokavian tenses (namely, aorist and imperfect) favor a particular aspect (but they are rarer or absent in Čakavian and Kajkavian).
