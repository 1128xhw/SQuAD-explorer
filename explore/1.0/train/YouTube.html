Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute. The system, which became known as Content ID, creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2007 youtube launched an automated system to detect what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">videos that infringe copyright</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Google's CEO in 2007?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eric Schmidt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the system that automatically detects copyright violations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Content ID</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the CEO of Google think the new software was necessary? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">resolving lawsuits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Content ID do if an upload is too close a match to a known copyright material?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flags the video</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube, and concluded that while the system was &quot;surprisingly resilient&quot; in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible. The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use. If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision. YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the ultimate view of Content ID's performance after a 2009 test?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">surprisingly resilient</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of 2010 what is the maximum length of a video a user can upload given the proper authority?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unlimited</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does one dispute the ruling of Content ID?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fill in a form</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the sites rules in Dec. 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">were modified</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's terms of service.

The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments. They give creators more power to moderate and block comments, and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better, more relevant discussions appear at the top. The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse. In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question &quot;why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?&quot; on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change. The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 &quot;thumbs down&quot; votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days. Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that &quot;Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos&quot; and &quot;Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system&quot;.

In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service &quot;to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms.&quot; Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that &quot;while we wish that we had [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience.&quot; The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service.
