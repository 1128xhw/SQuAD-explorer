These texts were subsequently developed and applied by later authorities, known as the Gaonim, Rishonim, and Acharonim. Orthodox Judaism generally includes Modern Orthodox Judaism (אורתודוקסיה מודרנית) and Ultra-Orthodox or Haredi Judaism (יהדות חרדית), but complete within is a wide range of philosophies. Although Orthodox Judaism would probably be considered the mainstream expression of Judaism prior to the 19th century, for some Orthodox Judaism is a modern self-identification that distinguishes it from traditional pre-modern Judaism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the approach to Judiasm that subscribes to a tradition of mass revelation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Orthodox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the book that has the laws and ethics for Orthodox Judaism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Torah </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what texts were legislated by the Tanarim and Amoraim?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Talmudic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What besides Modern Orthodox Judaism does Orthodox Judaism consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Haredi Judaism </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Orthodox Judaism is a self-identification that distinguishes it from what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pre-modern Judaism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to the New Jersey Press Association, several media entities refrain from using the term &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;, including the Religion Newswriters Association; JTA, the global Jewish news service; and the Star-Ledger, New Jersey’s largest daily newspaper.

In this view, Orthodox Judaism can &quot;be enriched&quot; by its intersection with modernity; further, &quot;modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the Divine work of transforming the world to benefit humanity&quot;.

As such, Orthodox Jews believe that one must be extremely careful in interpreting Jewish law. Orthodox Judaism holds that, given Jewish law's Divine origin, no underlying principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political, social or economic conditions; in this sense, &quot;creativity&quot; and development in Jewish law is limited.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the written law of the Torah known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pentateuch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who dictated the oral law to Moses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the detailed explanations of how to apply and interpret the laws of the written Torah called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oral Law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the law that is considered the core of religious laws Orthodox Jews know today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Sinaitic law </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the origin of Jewish Law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Divine </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In reaction to the emergence of Reform Judaism, a group of traditionalist German Jews emerged in support of some of the values of the Haskalah, but also wanted to defend the classic, traditional interpretation of Jewish law and tradition.

It is characterised by its focus on community-wide Torah study. Haredi Orthodoxy's differences with Modern Orthodoxy usually lie in interpretation of the nature of traditional halakhic concepts and in acceptable application of these concepts. Thus, engaging in the commercial world is a legitimate means to achieving a livelihood, but individuals should participate in modern society as little as possible. The same outlook is applied with regard to obtaining degrees necessary to enter one's intended profession: where tolerated in the Haredi society, attending secular institutions of higher education is viewed as a necessary but inferior activity. Academic interest is instead to be directed toward the religious education found in the yeshiva. Both boys and girls attend school and may proceed to higher Torah study, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18. A significant proportion of students, especially boys, remain in yeshiva until marriage (which is often arranged through facilitated dating – see shiduch), and many study in a kollel (Torah study institute for married men) for many years after marriage. Most Orthodox men (including many Modern Orthodox), even those not in Kollel, will study Torah daily.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of Judaism advocated segregation from non-Jewish culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Haredi Judaism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What should individuals participate as little as possible in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modern society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Attending secular institution of higher education is viewed as necessary but inferior in what society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Haredi </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do a significant portion of boys remain in until marriage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">yeshiva </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a Torah study institute for married men called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kollel </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Orthodox Judaism holds that on Mount Sinai, the Written Law was transmitted along with an Oral Law.

Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that under scrupulous examination, identical principles may lead to different applications in the context of modern life. To the Orthodox Jew, halakha is a guide, God's Law, governing the structure of daily life from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep. It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances (and many hypothetical ones). There are though a number of halakhic meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific halakha and a meta-principle, the meta-principle often wins out . Examples of Halakhic Meta-Principles are: &quot;Deracheha Darchei Noam&quot; - the ways of Torah are pleasant, &quot;Kavod Habriyot&quot; - basic respect for human beings, &quot;Pikuach Nefesh&quot; - the sanctity of human life.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do haredi Judaism and modern orthodox Judaism disagree about the application of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Halakha </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what law is halakha to the Orthodox Jew?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God's Law,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Basic respect for human beings is known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Kavod Habriyot&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The sanctiy of human life is known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Pikuach Nefesh&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does halakha guide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> structure of daily life</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Orthodox Judaism, Jewish law today is based on the commandments in the Torah, as viewed through the discussions and debates contained in classical rabbinic literature, especially the Mishnah and the Talmud.

It precedes the later and differs in its genesis and emerged focus. The movement originated in Eastern Europe (what is now Belarus and Ukraine) in the 18th century. Founded by Israel ben Eliezer, known as the Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760), it emerged in an age of persecution of the Jewish people, when a schism existed between scholarly and common European Jews. In addition to bridging this class gap, Hasidic teachings sought to reintroduce joy in the performance of the commandments and in prayer through the popularisation of Jewish mysticism (this joy had been suppressed in the intense intellectual study of the Talmud). The Ba'al Shem Tov sought to combine rigorous scholarship with more emotional mitzvah observance. In a practical sense, what distinguishes Hasidic Judaism from other forms of Haredi Judaism is the close-knit organization of Hasidic communities centered on a Rebbe (sometimes translated as &quot;Grand Rabbi&quot;), and various customs and modes of dress particular to each community. In some cases, there are religious ideological distinctions between Hasidic groups, as well. Another phenomenon that sets Hasidic Judaism apart from general Haredi Judaism is the strong emphasis placed on speaking Yiddish; in (many) Hasidic households and communities, Yiddish is spoken exclusively.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What overlaps significantly with Hasidic Judiasm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Haredi Judaism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What overlaps significantly with Haredi Judiasm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chasidic Judaism </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded what is known as the Baal Shem Tov?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Israel ben Eliezer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sought to combine rigourous scholarship with more emotional mitzvah observance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ba'al Shem Tov</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the spoken word known as in Hasidic Judiasm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yiddish </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In contrast to the general American Jewish community, which is dwindling due to low fertility and high intermarriage and assimilation rates, the Orthodox Jewish community of the United States is growing rapidly.
