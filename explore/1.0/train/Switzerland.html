While still named the &quot;Swiss Confederation&quot; for historical reasons, modern Switzerland is a federal directorial republic consisting of 26 cantons, with Bern as the seat of the federal authorities, called Bundesstadt (&quot;federal city&quot;).[note 3] The country is situated in Western and Central Europe,[note 4] and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi). While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8 million people is concentrated mostly on the Plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global and economic centres, Zürich and Geneva.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the official name of Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Swiss Confederation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of government does Switzerland have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a federal directorial republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many cantons are in Switzerland's federal directorial republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">26</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 3 geographical features divide Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the population of Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">approximately 8 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The establishment of the Swiss Confederation is traditionally dated to 1 August 1291, which is celebrated annually as the Swiss National Day.

Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world. In addition to being the birthplace of the Red Cross, Switzerland is home to numerous international organizations, including the second largest UN office. On the European level, it is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association, but notably it is not part of the European Union, nor the European Economic Area.

La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around 450 BC, possibly under some influence from the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the Helvetii. Steadily harassed by the Germans, in 58 BC the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss plateau and migrate to western Gallia, but Julius Caesar's armies pursued and defeated them at the Battle of Bibracte, in today's western France, forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland. In 15 BC, Tiberius, who was destined to be the second Roman emperor and his brother, Drusus, conquered the Alps, integrating them into the Roman Empire. The area occupied by the Helvetii—the namesakes of the later Confoederatio Helvetica—first became part of Rome's Gallia Belgica province and then of its Germania Superior province, while the eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. Sometime around the start of the Common Era, the Romans maintained a large legionary camp called Vindonissa, now a ruin at the confluence of the Aare and Reuss rivers, near the town of Windisch, an outskirt of Brugg.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the two earliest know cultural tribes in Switerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hallstatt and La Tène</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Swiss cultural tribe developed and flourished during the late Iron Age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">La Tène</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Swiss tribal group was defeated by Julius Caesar at the Battle of Bribacti as they tried to escape the Swiss plateau?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Helvetii </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Tiberius conquer the Alps, integrating them into the Roman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the large legionary camp, now a ruin, that the Romans maintained around the start of the Common Era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vindonissa</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In about 260 AD, the fall of the Agri Decumates territory north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire.

The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who conquered Switzerland in 1798?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the revolutionary French government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the French government impose on Switzerland in 1798, centralizing the Swiss government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a new unified constitution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was abolished with the introduction of the unified constitution in Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the cantons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the new regime created when the Cisalpine Republic separated from Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Helvetic Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which unpopular republic destroyed centuries of Swiss traditions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Helvetic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When war broke out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland.

It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the Jura mountains on the west. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area. The majority of the Swiss population live in the Swiss Plateau. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found, totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres (410 sq mi). From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe. The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe, among which are included Lake Geneva (also called le Lac Léman in French), Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes, and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water. Lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory. The largest lake is Lake Geneva, in western Switzerland shared with France. The Rhône is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva. Lake Constance is the second largest Swiss lake and, like the Lake Geneva, an intermediate step by the Rhine at the border to Austria and Germany. While the Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the French Camarque region and the Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, about 1000 km apart, both springs are only about 22 km apart from each other in the Swiss Alps.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which basic topographical area is in the south of Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Swiss Alps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which basic topographical area is in central Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Swiss Plateau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which basic topographical area is in western Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Jura mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of Switzerland's total area do the Alps comprise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the largest lake in Switzerland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lake Geneva</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>48 of Switzerland's mountains are 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea in altitude or higher.
