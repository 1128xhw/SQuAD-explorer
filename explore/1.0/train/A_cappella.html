It contrasts with cantata, which is accompanied singing. The term &quot;a cappella&quot; was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music. The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for alla breve.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does A cappella mean in the Italian language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the manner of the chapel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term occasionally used to refer to A cappella?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alla breve</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what point did Renaissance polyphony become popular again?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is A cappella currently defined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">group or solo singing without instrumental accompaniment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A cappella was originally used to tell the difference between which two styles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially church music as well as anasheed and zemirot. Gregorian chant is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the Renaissance. The madrigal, up until its development in the early Baroque into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form.

The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ &quot;doubling&quot; some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach, most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor. Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece, Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610, and Andrea Gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style. Learning from the preceding two composeres, Heinrich Schütz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the oratorio style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and the Passion. Five of Schutz's Historien were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of Matthew, Luke and John, were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a plainchant.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a known composer of A cappella music in the 15th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Josquin des Prez</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bach was influenced by a popular A cappella composer heavily for what composition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mass in B Minor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of Schutz's Easter pieces were in the A cappella style?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata's well known A cappella composition was written in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1610</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some compositions were found after which composer's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andrea Gabrieli</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, &quot;The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.&quot; This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian musika which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as khorovïye kontsertï (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, Grammatika musikiyskaya (1675), by Nikolai Diletsky. Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as Peter Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Arkhangelsky, and Mykola Leontovych are fine examples of this.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Russian musika show up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">khorovïye kontsertï</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">khorovïye kontsertï were typically done similar to what pieces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Venetian-styled</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bible passage gave rise to certain a cappella attitudes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Psalms 150</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who composed a popular Venetian-styled piece in 1675?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nikolai Diletsky</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Present-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include some Presbyterian churches devoted to the regulative principle of worship, Old Regular Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Plymouth Brethren, Churches of Christ, the Old German Baptist Brethren, Doukhobors the Byzantine Rite and the Amish, Old Order Mennonites and Conservative Mennonites. Certain high church services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic Mass and the Lutheran Divine Service) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many Mennonites also conduct some or all of their services without instruments.

The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented. Toward the end of the 2nd century, Christians began condemning the instruments themselves.

The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as zemirot outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During the Three Weeks musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the counting of the omer between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time. This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as sefirah music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what day is using musical instruments not allowed? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sabbath</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what style do Jewish families typically sing Sabbath songs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a cappella</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a cappella music occasionally called among those of Jewish faith?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sefirah music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many days are counted between Passover and Shavuot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">49</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is part of the time between Passover and Shavuot thought to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> a time of semi-mourning </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher Philo, born 20 BCE.

This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command (2 Chronicles 29:25). The shofar is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue, and it is only used from Rosh Chodesh Elul through the end of Yom Kippur.

The St. Olaf College Choir was established as an outgrowth of the local St. John's Lutheran Church, where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed, at least partially, of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus. The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors, and a rich tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like Concordia College (Moorhead, Minnesota), Augustana College (Rock Island, Illinois), Wartburg College (Waverly, Iowa), Luther College (Decorah, Iowa), Gustavus Adolphus College (St. Peter, Minnesota), Augustana College (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), and Augsburg College (Minneapolis, Minnesota).

The earliest reports of this style of a cappella music involved African Americans. The earliest documented quartets all began in barbershops. In 1938, the first formal men's barbershop organization was formed, known as the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A), and in 2004 rebranded itself and officially changed its public name to the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS). Today the BHS has over 22,000 members in approximately 800 chapters across the United States, and the barbershop style has spread around the world with organizations in many other countries. The Barbershop Harmony Society provides a highly organized competition structure for a cappella quartets and choruses singing in the barbershop style.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of a cappella music is specific to American culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barbershop music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the a cappella organization founded in 1938 change its name to in 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barbershop Harmony Society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people currently have membership to the BHS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 22,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What racial group was primarily involved in babershop a cappella in its earliest days?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African Americans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the initials of the BHS before it changes its name in 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1945, the first formal women's barbershop organization, Sweet Adelines, was formed.

The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956). All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a parody of the men's groups: the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and The Chattertocks of Brown University (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the Tufts University Beelzebubs and the Boston University Dear Abbeys. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including vocal percussion/&quot;beatboxing&quot;. Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as the Georgetown Chimes' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as International Quartet Champions The Boston Common and the contemporary commercial a cappella group Rockapella. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including John Legend, an alumnus of the Counterparts at the University of Pennsylvania, and Sara Bareilles, an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at University of California, Los Angeles. Mira Sorvino is an alumna of the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones of Harvard College where she had the solo on Only You by Yaz.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the previous name of oldest recorded college a cappella group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RPI Glee Club</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What prominent composer was once a member of The Whiffenpoofs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Cole Porter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the a capella group that was a parody of The Whiffenpoofs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the college a capella event that's been held since 1975?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Georgetown Chimes' Cherry Tree Massacre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What well-known musician was once part of the college a capella group The Counterparts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Legend</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups.

One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were The Mills Brothers whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; by 2 Unlimited was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series Tompkins Square. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for The New Addams Family series on Fox Family Channel (now ABC Family). Groups such as Vocal Sampling and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist Bobby McFerrin is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group Naturally Seven recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some a capella groups do other than sing words?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emulate instrumentation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What a capella group is credited for being one of the earliest to adapt instrumental emulation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> The Mills Brothers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of music did the Swingle Singers implement instrumental emulation for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baroque and Classical music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the ABC Family show whose theme is entirely a capella?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The New Addams Family</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Swingle Singers used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments.

Beatboxing, more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the hip-hop community, where rap is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements. Petra Haden used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of The Who Sell Out including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of Journey's &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot;, The Beach Boys' &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot;.
