The area was also characterized as &quot;one of the finest building sites in Florida.&quot; The Great Freeze of 1894–95 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced Henry Flagler, a railroad tycoon, to expand his Florida East Coast Railway to the region, for which she became known as &quot;the mother of Miami.&quot; Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896 with a population of just over 300.

The highest undulations are found along the coastal Miami Rock Ridge, whose substrate underlies most of the eastern Miami metropolitan region. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier islands, the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach.

This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15 m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or ice ages. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (8 m) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau, stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans. Starting about 100,000 years ago the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet (90 to 110 m) below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the mainland of South Florida just above sea level.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Miami limestone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miami oolite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many meters thick is the bedrock under Miami at its maximum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Stage occurred approximately 130,000 years ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sangamonian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many meters did the Sangamonian Stage raise sea levels compared to their present level?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event caused sea levels to decrease approximately 100,000 years ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wisconsin glaciation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah.

As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist.

Its sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the Tropic of Cancer, and proximity to the Gulf Stream shapes its climate. With January averaging 67.2 °F (19.6 °C), winter features mild to warm temperatures; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front, which produces much of the little amount of rainfall during the season. Lows occasionally fall below 50 °F (10 °C), but very rarely below 35 °F (2 °C).

Miami's explosive population growth has been driven by internal migration from other parts of the country, primarily up until the 1980s, as well as by immigration, primarily from the 1960s to the 1990s. Today, immigration to Miami has slowed significantly and Miami's growth today is attributed greatly to its fast urbanization and high-rise construction, which has increased its inner city neighborhood population densities, such as in Downtown, Brickell, and Edgewater, where one area in Downtown alone saw a 2,069% increase in population in the 2010 Census. Miami is regarded as more of a multicultural mosaic, than it is a melting pot, with residents still maintaining much of, or some of their cultural traits.

By 2014, a private project known as All Aboard Florida by a company of the historic Florida East Coast Railway began construction of a higher-speed rail line in South Florida that is planned to eventually terminate at Orlando International Airport.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Orlando, what city would have been connected to Miami via Florida High Speed Rail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tampa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the governor of Florida in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rick Scott</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did All Aboard Florida begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From South Florida, where will All Aboard Florida stretch to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Orlando International Airport</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company is responsible for All Aboard Florida?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Florida East Coast Railway</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Miami's road system is based along the numerical &quot;Miami Grid&quot; where Flagler Street forms the east-west baseline and Miami Avenue forms the north-south meridian. The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown Macy's (formerly the Burdine's headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have &quot;NW&quot; in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, therefore, the &quot;NW&quot; and &quot;SW&quot; quadrants are much larger than the &quot;SE&quot; and &quot;NE&quot; quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company was previously headquartered in the Downtown Macy's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burdine's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Tamiami Trail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">SW 8th St</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what neighborhood of Miami is the corner of Miami Avenue and Flagler Street?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Downtown </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Miami's street plan called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miami Grid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If a street is west of Miami Avenue and north of Flagler Street, what will necessarily be in its address?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">NW</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Miami has six major causeways that span over Biscayne Bay connecting the western mainland, with the eastern barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean.

Every month, the city hosts &quot;Bike Miami&quot;, where major streets in Downtown and Brickell are closed to automobiles, but left open for pedestrians and bicyclists. The event began in November 2008, and has doubled in popularity from 1,500 participants to about 3,000 in the October 2009 Bike Miami. This is the longest-running such event in the US. In October 2009, the city also approved an extensive 20-year plan for bike routes and paths around the city. The city has begun construction of bike routes as of late 2009, and ordinances requiring bike parking in all future construction in the city became mandatory as of October 2009.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cannot travel on Downtown Miami streets during &quot;Bike Miami&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">automobiles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people participated in Bike Miami in October of 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a recent mayor of Miami?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manny Diaz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Downtown, in what neighborhood of Miami does Bike Miami take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brickell </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what month in 2008 did Bike Miami start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
