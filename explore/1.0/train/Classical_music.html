While a similar term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600) eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), and Romantic eras (1804–1910); and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary or postmodern (1975–2015) eras.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Classical period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years are termed the Renaissance period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1400–1600</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years are termed the Baroque period? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1600–1750</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From 1804-1910 was called what era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romantic </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Classical music is rooted in what kind of tradition? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Classical music is rooted the the traditions of what kind of music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the period from 1750 to 1820 called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Classical period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What time period is known at the common practice period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between 1550 and 1900</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Renaissance era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1400–1600</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the modern era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1890–1930</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines and/or chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular music  styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles lend themselves to the song form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can attain a high level of complexity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is European art music distinguished from non-European and popular music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its system of staff notation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What method is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches, tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western staff notation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What popular styles practice improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jazz and blues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Since it is written down, classical music can attain a high level of what? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">complexity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is European art music distinguished from many other musical forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its system of staff notation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long has the system of staff notation been in use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">since about the 16th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jazz and blues use ad libitum and what other ornamentation? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">improvisation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Classic music can a attain a high level of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">complexity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The term &quot;classical music&quot; did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a golden age.

However, there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain, such as the use of a printed score and the performance of very complex instrumental works (e.g., the fugue). As well, although the symphony did not exist through the entire classical music period, from the mid-1700s to the 2000s the symphony ensemble—and the works written for it—have become a defining feature of classical music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sang Medieval plainchant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Avant-garde atonal compositions were written for what instrument?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">solo piano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two characteristics of classical music can not be attributed to other genres?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">use of a printed score and the performance of very complex instrumental works</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Through what period did the symphony not exist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the entire classical music period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has become a defining feature of classical music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the symphony ensemble</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did not exist through the entire classical music period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the symphony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The use of a printed score and the performance of very complex instrumental works are characteristics of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classical music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sang medieval plainchant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The key characteristic of classical music that distinguishes it from popular music and folk music is that the repertoire tends to be written down in musical notation, creating a musical part or score. This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: J.S. Bach's fugues, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic that would be impossible in the heat of live improvisation. The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music (the melodies, lyrics, forms, and rhythms) being reproduced.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">J.S.

The performer and/or the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during fermatas (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The score does not provide complete and exact instruction on how to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">perform a historical work</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what era were many works designed for basso continuo accompaniment? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Baroque era</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Vibrato and glissando are possible on stringed, brass, woodwind and what other style instrument?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the human voice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are fermatas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">held notes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for musical improvisation, from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era.

J.S. Bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations. During the Classical era, the composer-performer Mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.

The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music and includes members of the string, woodwind, brass, and percussion families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and amount of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a double bass. The vocal practices changed a great deal over the classical period, from the single line monophonic Gregorian chant done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, polyphonic choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instrument currently used in most classical music where invented before what period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mid-19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most widely known medium for classical music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The symphony orchestra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A symphony orchestra includes members of the string, woodwind, percussion and what other family of instruments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">brass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a symphony orchestra have that is missing from a concert band?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a string section</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What practice has changed a great deal over the classical period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vocal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms.

The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute. The composer's instrumentation usually included paired flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular timbral &quot;palette&quot; in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of &quot;choral&quot; brass in the Trio. Piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones add to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No. 5. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver &quot;storm&quot; and &quot;sunshine&quot; in the Sixth. The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the &quot;Eroica&quot; (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion—plus chorus and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony should be expanded. For several decades after he died, symphonic instrumentation was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom is the &quot;standard complement&quot; attributed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beethoven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">PIccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones add to the triumphal finales of what piece by Beethoven?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Symphony No. 5</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was symphonic instrumentation faithful to Beethoven's after he died?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> several decades </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Beethoven expand in his Symphonies, 3, 5, 6 and 9?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">timbral &quot;palette&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A Piccolo and trombones provides the illusion of storm and what in Beethoven's Sixth Symphony?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sunshine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Romantic era, the modern piano, with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano.

In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that &quot;compensating for the expected leaves of absence&quot; of maternity leave would be a problem.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What gender of musician has historically made up a large amount of professional orchestras?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">male</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Women were first hired in professional orchestras for what position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">harpist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Vienna Philharmonic first accept women?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which major orchestra was the last to appoint a woman to a permanent position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Berlin Philharmonic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the principal flute for the Vienna Philharmonic in 1996?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dieter Flury</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was &quot;facing protests during a [US] tour&quot; by the National Organization for Women and the International Alliance for Women in Music.

The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as Aristoxenus and Pythagoras. Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify musical notation. Ancient Greek instruments such as the aulos (a reed instrument) and the lyre (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra.

Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for serenades. Opera continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The opera buffa, a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The symphony came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill.

The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.

Yet in the 20th century, this oral tradition and passing on of stylistic features within classical music disappeared. Instead, musicians tend to use just the score to play music. Yet, even with the score providing the key elements of the music, there is considerable controversy about how to perform the works. Some of this controversy relates to the fact that this score-centric approach has led to performances that emphasize metrically strict block-rhythms (just as the music is notated in the score).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Improvisation is integral before what took a high significance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the score</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did oral tradition disappear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">There is still controversy about how to perform works, even though scores provide what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">key elements of the music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A score-centric approach strictly emphasizes what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">block-rhythms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Improvisation once played an important role in classical music. A remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the cadenza, a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works, designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument. Traditionally this was improvised by the performer; however, it is often written for (or occasionally by) the performer beforehand. Improvisation is also an important aspect in authentic performances of operas of Baroque era and of bel canto (especially operas of Vincenzo Bellini), and is best exemplified by the da capo aria, a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section ('B section' / the 'da capo' part). An example is Beverly Sills' complex, albeit pre-written, variation of Da tempeste il legno infranto from Händel's Giulio Cesare.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What once played an important role in classical music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Improvisation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can a remnant of improvisation tradition be found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cadenza</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can solo performers exhibit during a cadenza?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their virtuoso skills on the instrument</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of performances of Baroque ear Operas require improvisation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">authentic performances</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">An example of improvisation in an opera is Beverly Sills variation of what movement of Handel's Giulio Cesare?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Da tempeste il legno infranto</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks).

During the classical era, Mozart and Beethoven often improvised the cadenzas to their piano concertos (and thereby encouraged others to do so), but they also provided written cadenzas for use by other soloists. In opera, the practice of singing strictly by the score, i.e. come scritto, was famously propagated by soprano Maria Callas, who called this practice 'straitjacketing' and implied that it allows the intention of the composer to be understood better, especially during studying the music for the first time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was improvisation in classical music performance common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Baroque and early romantic eras</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did improvisation begin to lessened strongly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the second half of the 19th and in the 20th centuries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part did Mozart and Beethoven often improvise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the cadenzas to their piano concertos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name for the practice of singing strictly by the score in opera?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ome scritto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who strongly supposed ome scritto?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soprano Maria Callas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composer's time.
