Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">data compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be either lossy or lossless?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lossless compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process called of reducing the size of a data file?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">data compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process called of encoding at the source of the data before it's processed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">source coding</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Compression is useful because it helps reduce resource usage, such as data storage space or transmission capacity. Because compressed data must be decompressed to use, this extra processing imposes computational or other costs through decompression; this situation is far from being a free lunch. Data compression is subject to a space–time complexity trade-off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What helps reduce resource usage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must be decompressed? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">compressed data</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is subject to a space-time complexity trade off? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Data compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of scheme involves trade offs among other things?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> data compression</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lossless data compression algorithms usually exploit statistical redundancy to represent data without losing any information, so that the process is reversible.

Also noteworthy is the LZR (Lempel-Ziv–Renau) algorithm, which serves as the basis for the Zip method.[citation needed] LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often Huffman encoded (e.g. SHRI, LZX). Current LZ-based coding schemes that perform well are Brotli and LZX.

Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a finite-state machine to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the probability distribution of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was its use as an optional (but not widely used) feature of the JPEG image coding standard. It has since been applied in various other designs including H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC for video coding.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be paired with an algorithm called arithmetic coding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">statistical estimates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can achieve superior compression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arithmetic coding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What uses an internal memory state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Huffman algorithm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lossy data compression is the converse of lossless data compression. In these schemes, some loss of information is acceptable. Dropping nonessential detail from the data source can save storage space. Lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive the data in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in luminance than it is to the variations in color. JPEG image compression works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information. There is a corresponding trade-off between preserving information and reducing size. A number of popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences, including those used in music files, images, and video.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of data compression is the converse of lossless date data compression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lossy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can save storage space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dropping nonessential detail from the data source</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What helps by eliminating off nonessential bits of information?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">JPEG image compression</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In lossy audio compression, methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the audio signal.

Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of waveforms and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like FLAC, Shorten and TTA use linear prediction to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many of these algorithms use convolution with the filter [-1 1] to slightly whiten or flatten the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently.

In 1983, using the psychoacoustic principle of the masking of critical bands first published in 1967, he started developing a practical application based on the recently developed IBM PC computer, and the broadcast automation system was launched in 1987 under the name Audicom. Twenty years later, almost all the radio stations in the world were using similar technology manufactured by a number of companies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the first commercial broadcast automation audio compression system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oscar Bonello</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was an engineering professor at the University of Buenos Aires?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oscar Bonello</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was launched in 1987 under the name Audicom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">broadcast automation system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The majority of video compression algorithms use lossy compression. Uncompressed video requires a very high data rate. Although lossless video compression codecs perform at a compression factor of 5-12, a typical MPEG-4 lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200. As in all lossy compression, there is a trade-off between video quality, cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting artifacts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What all mostly use lossy compression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">video compression algorithms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What requires a high data rate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uncompressed video</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What may present visible or distracting artifacts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Highly compressed video</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some video compression schemes typically operate on square-shaped groups of neighboring pixels, often called macroblocks. These pixel groups or blocks of pixels are compared from one frame to the next, and the video compression codec sends only the differences within those blocks. In areas of video with more motion, the compression must encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high-frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to increases in the variable bitrate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What compression typically operate on square-shaped groups of pixels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">video</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What only sends the differences within those pixels and blocks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">macroblocks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does high-frequency detail lead to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">variable bitrate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Video data may be represented as a series of still image frames. The sequence of frames contains spatial and temporal redundancy that video compression algorithms attempt to eliminate or code in a smaller size. Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between frames, or by using perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in JPEG image compression. Some of these methods are inherently lossy while others may preserve all relevant information from the original, uncompressed video.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What may be represented as a series of still image frames?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Video data</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can average a color across similar areas to reduce space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Compression algorithms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is hard to tell with smaller differences involved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">color</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most powerful used method works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system simply issues a short command that copies that part of the previous frame, bit-for-bit, into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor emits a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Interframe compression works well for programs that will simply be played back by the viewer, but can cause problems if the video sequence needs to be edited.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What still remains much shorter than intraframe compression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">longer command</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens when a frame contains areas where nothing has moved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the system simply issues a short command</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a sequence that can be edited?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">video</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because interframe compression copies data from one frame to another, if the original frame is simply cut out (or lost in transmission), the following frames cannot be reconstructed properly. Some video formats, such as DV, compress each frame independently using intraframe compression. Making 'cuts' in intraframe-compressed video is almost as easy as editing uncompressed video: one finds the beginning and ending of each frame, and simply copies bit-for-bit each frame that one wants to keep, and discards the frames one doesn't want. Another difference between intraframe and interframe compression is that, with intraframe systems, each frame uses a similar amount of data. In most interframe systems, certain frames (such as &quot;I frames&quot; in MPEG-2) aren't allowed to copy data from other frames, so they require much more data than other frames nearby.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What copies data from one frame to another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">interframe compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a type of video format?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is almost as easy as editing uncompressed video?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Making 'cuts'</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Today, nearly all commonly used video compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the ITU-T or ISO) apply a discrete cosine transform (DCT) for spatial redundancy reduction. The DCT that is widely used in this regard was introduced by N. Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. Other methods, such as fractal compression, matching pursuit and the use of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for the use of wavelet coding as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do all commonly used video compression methods use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">discrete cosine transform</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a DCT do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spatial redundancy reduction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is not used in practical products? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fractal compression</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genetics compression algorithms are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading general-purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the latest generation of lossless algorithms? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genetics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What encoding reduces the heterogeneity of a dataset by sorting SNPs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MAFE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two algorithms have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DNAZip and GenomeZip</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
