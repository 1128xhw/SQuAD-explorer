They inhabit Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe, North Asia and Central Asia. Slavs speak Indo-European Slavic languages and share, to varying degrees, some cultural traits and historical backgrounds. From the early 6th century they spread to inhabit most of Central and Eastern Europe and Southeast Europe, whilst Slavic mercenaries fighting for the Byzantines and Arabs settled Asia Minor and even as far as Syria. The East Slavs colonised Siberia and Central Asia.[better source needed] Presently over half of Europe's territory is inhabited by Slavic-speaking communities, but every Slavic ethnicity has emigrated to other continents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the largest Indo-European ethno-linguistic group in Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Slavs are the largest Indo-European ethno-linguistic group in Europe.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What areas of the world do Slavs inhabit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">They inhabit Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe, North Asia and Central Asia.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was colonised by the East Slavs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The East Slavs colonised Siberia and Central Asia.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What portion of Europe's territory is inhabited by Slavic-speaking communities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Presently over half of Europe's territory is inhabited by Slavic-speaking communities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Slavic mercenaries settled where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Slavic mercenaries fighting for the Byzantines and Arabs settled Asia Minor and even as far as Syria.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Present-day Slavic people are classified into West Slavic (chiefly Poles, Czechs and Slovaks), East Slavic (chiefly Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians), and South Slavic (chiefly Serbs, Bulgarians, Croats, Bosniaks, Macedonians, Slovenes, and Montenegrins), though sometimes the West Slavs and East Slavs are combined into a single group known as North Slavs. For a more comprehensive list, see the ethnocultural subdivisions.

Pan-Slavism became compromised when the Russian Empire started to use it as an ideology justifying its territorial conquests in Central Europe as well as subjugation of other ethnic groups of Slavic origins such as Poles and Ukrainians, and the ideology became associated with Russian imperialism. The common Slavic experience of communism combined with the repeated usage of the ideology by Soviet propaganda after World War II within the Eastern bloc (Warsaw Pact) was a forced high-level political and economic hegemony of the USSR dominated by Russians.

For example, in the Balkans, there were Paleo-Balkan peoples, such as Romanized and Hellenized (Jireček Line) Illyrians, Thracians and Dacians, as well as Greeks and Celtic Scordisci. Over time, due to the larger number of Slavs, most descendants of the indigenous populations of the Balkans were Slavicized. The Thracians and Illyrians vanished from the population during this period – although the modern Albanian nation claims descent from the Illyrians. Exceptions are Greece, where the lesser numbered Slavs scattered there came to be Hellenized (aided in time by more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration) and Romania where Slavic people settled en route for present-day Greece, Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and East Thrace whereby the Slavic population had come to assimilate. Bulgars were also assimilated by local Slavs but their ruling status and subsequent land cast the nominal legacy of Bulgarian country and people onto all future generations. The Romance speakers within the fortified Dalmatian cities managed to retain their culture and language for a long time, as Dalmatian Romance was spoken until the high Middle Ages.

Scandinavians (Varangians) and Finnic peoples were involved in the early formation of the Rus' state but were completely Slavicized after a century. Some Finno-Ugric tribes in the north were also absorbed into the expanding Rus population. At the time of the Magyar migration, the present-day Hungary was inhabited by Slavs, numbering about 200,000, and by Romano-Dacians who were either assimilated or enslaved by the Magyars. In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Kipchaks and the Pechenegs, caused a massive migration of East Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north.

Polabian-Pomeranian Slavs are also known to have even settled on Norse age Iceland. Saqaliba refers to the Slavic mercenaries and slaves in the medieval Arab world in North Africa, Sicily and Al-Andalus. Saqaliba served as caliph's guards. In the 12th century, there was intensification of Slavic piracy in the Baltics. The Wendish Crusade was started against the Polabian Slavs in 1147, as a part of the Northern Crusades. Niklot, pagan chief of the Slavic Obodrites, began his open resistance when Lothar III, Holy Roman Emperor, invaded Slavic lands. In August 1160 Niklot was killed and German colonization (Ostsiedlung) of the Elbe-Oder region began. In Hanoverian Wendland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Lusatia invaders started germanization. Early forms of germanization were described by German monks: Helmold in the manuscript Chronicon Slavorum and Adam of Bremen in Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. The Polabian language survived until the beginning of the 19th century in what is now the German state of Lower Saxony. In Eastern Germany, around 20% of Germans have Slavic paternal ancestry. Similarly, in Germany, around 20% of the foreign surnames are of Slavic origin.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who settled in parts of England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polabian Slavs (Wends)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Polabian Slavs (Wends) settle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parts of England (Danelaw)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Polabian-Pomeranian Slavs are also known to have even settled where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Norse age Iceland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What refers to the Slavic mercenaries and slaves in the medieval Arab world in North Africa, Sicily and Al-Andalus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saqaliba</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Saqaliba served as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">caliph's guards</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cossacks, although Slavic-speaking and Orthodox Christians, came from a mix of ethnic backgrounds, including Tatars and other Turks.
