The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field, Ampère's force law, was discovered later by André-Marie Ampère in 1820. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the first electrostatic device?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andrew Gordon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered the principles of magnetic and electric interactions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">André-Marie Ampère</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Faraday convert electrical energy into mechanical energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1821</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What toxic substance originally served the function of brine in primitive motors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mercury</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1827, Hungarian physicist Ányos Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils.

The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and Davenport went bankrupt. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues. No electricity distribution had been developed at the time.

The first commercially successful DC motors followed the invention by Zénobe Gramme who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti's design.

Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by Thomas Edison), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided controls systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887–88 in Richmond VA, the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently powered centrally controlled cars, which were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the South Side Elevated Railway where it became popularly known as the &quot;L&quot;. Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry, while almost simultaneously another great inventor was developing its primary competitor, which would become much more widespread. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of a relatively small air gap between rotor and stator. Efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap. [a] The St. Louis motor, long used in classrooms to illustrate motor principles, is extremely inefficient for the same reason, as well as appearing nothing like a modern motor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What needs to exist between the rotor and stator for increased efficiency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small air gap</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which inventor created the first useful DC motor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Julian Sprague </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the transportation advancement made possible by Sprague's designs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electric trolley system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Chicago's first electric trolley system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South Side Elevated Railway</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Sprague work for early in his career?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Edison</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Application of electric motors revolutionized industry.

In the 1880s, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that &quot;the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.&quot; In 1888, Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.  The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor. The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower (HP) induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who built the first induction motor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Walter Baily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of power were early motors unable to use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought Tesla's patents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Westinghouse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what application was Tesla's motor first used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mining </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's another name for the bar-winding-rotor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">squirrel-cage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A commutator is a mechanism used to switch the input of most DC machines and certain AC machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated from each other and from the electric motor's shaft.

This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts.

Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What may servo motors be used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must be well understood when applying a servo motor for use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">speed, torque, and power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factors limit performance of servo motors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">winding inductance and rotor inertia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Large, slow servos can use what types of motors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conventional AC or DC motors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When might coreless motors be used in servo applications?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">As dynamic response requirements increase</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running; a stepper system relies on the motor not to &quot;miss steps&quot; for short term accuracy, although a stepper system may include a &quot;home&quot; switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control.

In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it &quot;steps&quot;—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When are stepper motors most useful?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when precise rotations are required</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two devices can describe a stepper motor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do stepper motor rotors allign themselves with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> magnetic field produced by the energized field winding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does a stepper motor differ from a synchronous motor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the stepper motor may not rotate continuously</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of velocities and positions is the stepper motor capable of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to &quot;cog&quot; to a limited number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly.

As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term &quot;voice coil&quot; in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads.
