A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.

The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who invented the concept of a programmable computer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Babbage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is considered the &quot;father of the computer&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Babbage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what century was the first mechanical computer invented by Charles Babbage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> early 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Charles Babbage find out that An Analytical Engine was possible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> 1833</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The machine was about a century ahead of its time.

He went on to prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the paper &quot;On Computable Numbers&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alan Turing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Alan Turing write the paper, &quot;On Computable Numbers&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1936</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Turing revise the results on the limits of proof and computation in 1931?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kurt Gödel</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>He also introduced the notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a Universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable.

The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program[citation needed], architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which computer is the Harvard architecture modeled after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Harvard Mark I computer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A computer that stores its program in memory and kept separate from the data is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the Harvard architecture </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while this technique was used with many early computers, it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs.

High level languages are usually &quot;compiled&quot; into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler. High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer.

As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the computer has memory cells called registers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The CPU </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the typical range of registers for a CPU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> two and one hundred registers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of memory can a CPU only read from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> ROM</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of memory can a CPU read and write from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RAM</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of memory is always kept and kept the same?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ROM </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A progam inside the ROM of a PC is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> the BIOS</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Software stored in ROM is called what usually?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">firmware,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM cache memories, which are slower than registers but faster than main memory.

Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant.
