Enumerators were instructed to no longer use the &quot;Mulatto&quot; classification. Instead, they were given special instructions for reporting the race of interracial persons. A person with both white and black ancestry (termed &quot;blood&quot;) was to be recorded as &quot;Negro,&quot; no matter the fraction of that lineage (the &quot;one-drop rule&quot;). A person of mixed black and American Indian ancestry was also to be recorded as &quot;Neg&quot; (for &quot;Negro&quot;) unless he was considered to be &quot;predominantly&quot; American Indian and accepted as such within the community. A person with both White and American Indian ancestry was to be recorded as an Indian, unless his American Indian ancestry was small, and he was accepted as white within the community. In all situations in which a person had White and some other racial ancestry, he was to be reported as that other race. Persons who had minority interracial ancestry were to be reported as the race of their father.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word was dropped as a racial classification in this year's census?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mulatto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were people that had black and white ancestor classified as in this census? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Negro</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were people with both black and American Indian ancestry recorded in this census? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when a mixed race person in recorded as negro in this census, even if only a fraction of their ancestry is black?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one-drop rule</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which parent was the deciding factor for how interracial persons were recorded in this census? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their father</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Race was asked differently in the Census 2000 in several other ways than previously. Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities. Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members of two or more races. Because of these changes, the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 census or earlier censuses. Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were census respondents first able to select more than one race? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many American reported being of more than one race in the Census 2000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nearly seven million </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many race categories were respondents able to select in the Census 2000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one or more</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the last census before the Census 2000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In September 1997, during the process of revision of racial categories previously declared by OMB directive no. 15, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) recommended that OMB combine the &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; categories into one question to appear as &quot;race/ethnicity&quot; for the 2000 US Census.
