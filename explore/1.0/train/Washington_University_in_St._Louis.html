U., or WUSTL) is a private research university located in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Founded in 1853, and named after George Washington, the university has students and faculty from all 50 U.S. states and more than 120 countries. Twenty-five Nobel laureates have been affiliated with Washington University, nine having done the major part of their pioneering research at the university. Washington University's undergraduate program is ranked 15th by U.S. News and World Report.

The board first approved &quot;Eliot Seminary,&quot; but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university. In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to &quot;Washington Institute&quot; in honor of George Washington. Naming the University after the nation's first president, only seven years before the American Civil War and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the University amended its name to &quot;Washington University.&quot; The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix &quot;in St. Louis&quot; to distinguish the university from the nearly two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the names that was initially considered for Washington University in St. Louis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eliot Seminary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name was selected by the Board of Trustees in 1854 for Washington University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Washington Institute</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Board of Trustees choose to name Washing University after George Washington?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the name Washington University amended? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1856</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the suffix &quot;in St. Louis&quot; added to Washington University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1976</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although chartered as a university, for many years Washington University functioned primarily as a night school located on 17th Street and Washington Avenue in the heart of downtown St. Louis. Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the St. Louis Public Schools. Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings.

The University Board of Directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm Olmsted, Olmsted &amp; Eliot of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, Henry Ware Eliot, and William Huse found a site of 103 acres (41.7 ha) just beyond Forest Park, located west of the city limits in St. Louis County. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the Acropolis and inspired the nickname of &quot;Hilltop&quot; campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor William H.

The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope &amp; Stewardson’s original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Washington University hold a national design contest for the new campus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1899</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What firm won the Washington University national design contest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cope &amp; Stewardson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the cornerstone laid for Busch Hall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 20, 1900</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the names of the three buildings constructed after Busch Hall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Washington University delay occupying of the new campus buildings until 1905?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After working for many years at the University of Chicago, Arthur Holly Compton returned to St. Louis in 1946 to serve as Washington University's ninth chancellor.

According to the Center for Measuring University Performance, it is considered to be one of the top 10 private research universities in the nation. A dedicated Office of Undergraduate Research is located on the Danforth Campus and serves as a resource to post research opportunities, advise students in finding appropriate positions matching their interests, publish undergraduate research journals, and award research grants to make it financially possible to perform research.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many schools does Washington University have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of undergraduate students are involved in faculty research?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the Center for Measuring University performance rank Washington University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one of the top 10 private research universities in the nation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Office of Undergraduate Research located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Danforth Campus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During fiscal year 2007, $537.5 million was received in total research support, including $444 million in federal obligations.

Known as SU for short, the Student Union sponsors large-scale campus programs including WILD (a semesterly concert in the quad) and free copies of the New York Times, USA Today, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch through The Collegiate Readership Program; it also contributes to the Assembly Series, a weekly lecture series produced by the University, and funds the campus television station, WUTV, and the radio station, KWUR. KWUR was named best radio station in St. Louis of 2003 by the Riverfront Times despite the fact that its signal reaches only a few blocks beyond the boundaries of the campus. There are 11 fraternities and 9 sororities, with approximately 35% of the student body being involved in Greek life. The Congress of the South 40 (CS40) is a Residential Life and Events Programming Board, which operates outside of the SU sphere. CS40's funding comes from the Housing Activities Fee of each student living on the South 40.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many student organizations does Washington University have on campus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">300 </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are most student organizations at Washington University funded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by the Washington University Student Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the amount of the Washington University Student Union annual budget?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> $2 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of students are involved in Greek life at Washington University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many fraternities are located at Washington University?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Washington University has a large number of student-run musical groups on campus, including 12 official a cappella groups.
