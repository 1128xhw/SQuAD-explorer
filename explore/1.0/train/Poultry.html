These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae, in order Anseriformes, commonly known as &quot;waterfowl&quot; and including domestic ducks and domestic geese. Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word &quot;poultry&quot; comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the significance of poultry in the lives of humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kept by humans for the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are all domesticated and wild birds classified as poultry  ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of  birds are most commonly considered poultry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chickens, quails and turkeys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was the Latin word for poultry also used to decribe other small animals as opposed to any poulty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are any other birds considered common in the world of poultry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">domestic ducks and domestic geese.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long have humans used domsticated poultry ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have people use domesticated poultry for besides food ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did humans feel that addtional breeding tatics were necessary in poulty? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Has breeding changed the original characterictics of the animals ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How popular is poultry as a consumable among humans ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>&quot;Poultry&quot; is a term used for any kind of domesticated bird, captive-raised for its utility, and traditionally the word has been used to refer to wildfowl (Galliformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes). &quot;Poultry&quot; can be defined as domestic fowls, including chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks, raised for the production of meat or eggs and the word is also used for the flesh of these birds used as food. The Encyclopædia Britannica lists the same bird groups but also includes guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons). In R. D. Crawford's Poultry breeding and genetics, squabs are omitted but Japanese quail and common pheasant are added to the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild. In his 1848 classic book on poultry, Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management, Edmund Dixon included chapters on the peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams. In colloquial speech, the term &quot;fowl&quot; is often used near-synonymously with &quot;domesticated chicken&quot; (Gallus gallus), or with &quot;poultry&quot; or even just &quot;bird&quot;, and many languages do not distinguish between &quot;poultry&quot; and &quot;fowl&quot;. Both words are also used for the flesh of these birds. Poultry can be distinguished from &quot;game&quot;, defined as wild birds or mammals hunted for food or sport, a word also used to describe the flesh of these when eaten.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two addtional types of birds are listed in teh Encyclopedia Britanica as poultry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the authoor of the book Poultry Breeding and Genetics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">R. D. Crawford</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most likely outout for the common variety of pheasant ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Edmund Dixon is most famous for what inclusions in his 1854 book on poultry ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do all language make the distinction between poultry and fowls?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">many languages do not distinguish between &quot;poultry&quot; and &quot;fowl</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chickens are medium-sized, chunky birds with an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, and have more exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from grey junglefowl. Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation. Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are male chickens called ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cocks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are male chickens able to be identified ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, and have more exaggerated plumage than females (hens).</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do chickens normally consume when in the natural wild environment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do chickens fly like other birds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">They seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what birds are chickens decended from ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chickens have been established, but with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the poultry business boom in the United States ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can you normally identify a cock when recently hatched?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How has breeding helped in the pultry industry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are there any purebreed lines for poultry today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed, or a &quot;true bantam&quot; with no larger counterpart.

Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour.

Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can you identify a duck from other poultry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">medium-sized aquatic birds with broad bills, eyes on the side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do you call a male duck?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drake</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can you identify a drake from a the female of the species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the diet of cultivated ducks consistof ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do all ducks fly south for the winter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Clay models of ducks found in China dating back to 4000 BC may indicate the domestication of ducks took place there during the Yangshao culture.

Lucius Columella, writing in the first century BC, advised those who sought to rear ducks to collect wildfowl eggs and put them under a broody hen, because when raised in this way, the ducks &quot;lay aside their wild nature and without hesitation breed when shut up in the bird pen&quot;.

Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs, and down. As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom and the United States is the Pekin duck, which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) in 44 days. In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What breed of duck is considered the first?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the ancestor of all breeds of domestic duck (with the exception of the Muscovy duck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the outcomes of the breeding of ducks for humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What variety is the most common the the United States and the U.K.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pekin duck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the Pekin duck the favored of the western world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) in 44 days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is duck more common than other poultry in the east society ??</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The greylag goose (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians at least 3000 years ago, and a different wild species, the swan goose (Anser cygnoides), domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later, is known as a Chinese goose.

The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">do domestic and wild geese have the same apperearance ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of geese are used for human consumption?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The greylag-derived birds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of geese are used most efficiently for their egg production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> Chinese geese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the down feathers of geese most commonly used for ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer"> use in pillows and padded garments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the meat of geese considered fatty ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six subspecies of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) found in the present Mexican states of Jalisco, Guerrero and Veracruz.

The lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day, or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly. Females achieve slaughter weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19. Mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts. Many different breeds have been developed, but the majority of commercial birds are white, as this improves the appearance of the dressed carcass, the pin feathers being less visible. Turkeys were at one time mainly consumed on special occasions such as Christmas (10 million birds in the United Kingdom) or Thanksgiving (60 million birds in the United States).

In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Have quails ever been used for entertainment purposes ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can quails typically be found in the wild?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the typical diet consist of for qails ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what country do most domesticated  quails today descend from ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) </span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early 20th century, Japanese breeders began to selectively breed for increased egg production.

After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries. Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies.

Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators.

This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities.

Poultry can also be kept in a barn system, with no access to the open air, but with the ability to move around freely inside the building. The most intensive system for egg-laying chickens is battery cages, often set in multiple tiers. In these, several birds share a small cage which restricts their ability to move around and behave in a normal manner.

The dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin, which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells. White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying. Thus, the chicken's leg and thigh meat are dark, while its breast meat (which makes up the primary flight muscles) is white. Other birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore dark meat) throughout. Some cuts of meat including poultry expose the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can diffract light and produce iridescent colours, an optical phenomenon sometimes called structural colouration.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are there reasons for the dark meat  that poultry has?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin, which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the white meat of chicken actually used for by the animal ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes the meat of some poultry to show rainbow like colr striations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can diffract light and produce iridescent colours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do some varities of  poultry have more dark meat than others?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore dark meat) throughout</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A 2011 study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that 47% of the meat and poultry sold in United States grocery stores was contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, and 52% of the bacteria concerned showed resistance to at least three groups of antibiotics.

Many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about six months after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when it may be difficult to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are poultry eggs used for aside from consumption?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs. </span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the major difficulty faced in using poultry to cultivate vaccines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">egg allergies are unable to be immunised</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long does it take for the flu vaccine to be fully ready for deployment into the population ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">process that takes about six months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In order to make a vaccine , what do viruses require that bacteria does not?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">viruses need living cells in which to replicate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new technology is being used in teh vaccine making process that will make vaccines safer and eaier for most consumers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">.
