By this edict the state's authority and that of the Church became somewhat overlapping. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and state was the sharing of state powers of legal enforcement with church authorities.

For some years after the Reformation, Protestant churches were also known to execute those they considered heretics, including Catholics. The last known heretic executed by sentence of the Roman Catholic Church was Spanish schoolmaster Cayetano Ripoll in 1826. The number of people executed as heretics under the authority of the various &quot;ecclesiastical authorities&quot;[note 1] is not known.[note 2] One of the first examples of the word as translated from the Nag Hammadi's Apocalypse of Peter was&quot; they will cleave to the name of a dead man thinking that they will become pure.

The Church had always dealt harshly with strands of Christianity that it considered heretical, but before the 11th century these tended to centre around individual preachers or small localised sects, like Arianism, Pelagianism, Donatism, Marcionism and Montanism. The diffusion of the almost Manichaean sect of Paulicians westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of Bogomils in modern day Bosnia, a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianity. By the 11th century, more organised groups such as the Patarini, the Dulcinians, the Waldensians and the Cathars were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of northern Italy, southern France and Flanders.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is thought of to spiritually cut one off from the Church even before excommunication?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">obstinate and willful manifest heresy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book gives the definition of a heretic as anyone that does not follow the Catholic Church or the orthodox holy faith?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Codex Justinianus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What groups are cited as being considered heretical by the Church before the 11th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arianism, Pelagianism, Donatism, Marcionism and Montanism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group moved westward to give rise to the famous 11th and 12th century heresy in western Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paulicians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What groups began to appear in northern Italy and southern France during the 11th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Patarini, the Dulcinians, the Waldensians and the Cathars</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In France the Cathars grew to represent a popular mass movement and the belief was spreading to other areas.

Under Edward VI, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity). Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of &quot;...a subversive fifth column.&quot; The last execution of a &quot;heretic&quot; in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612. Although the charge was technically one of &quot;blasphemy&quot; there was one later execution in Scotland (still at that date an entirely independent kingdom) when in 1697 Thomas Aikenhead was accused, among other things, of denying the doctrine of the Trinity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event in England during the 16th century had an outcome of many deaths for heresy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European Reformation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what king's reign did 60 Protestants die for heresy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry VIII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two notable figures are cited to have perished for refusing to give up the Church in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under which king were the heresy laws repealed in 1547?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward VI</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the last known person sentenced to death in England for heresy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1612</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the Boston martyrs in 1659, 1660, and 1661.
