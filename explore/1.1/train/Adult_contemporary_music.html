AC radio often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s.

A few offered 90% instrumentals, and a handful were entirely instrumental. The easy listening format, as it was first known, was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as &quot;rock and roll&quot; stations. Billboard first published the Easy Listening chart July 17, 1961, with 20 songs; the first number one was &quot;Boll Weevil Song&quot; by Brook Benton. The chart described itself as &quot;not too far out in either direction&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what decade of easy listening radio does adult contemporary trace its heritage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Generally speaking, what percentage of music on easy listening stations was instrumental?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70-80%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was the Billboard easy listening chart first published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 17, 1961</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many songs were on the first Billboard easy listening chart?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who performed the first #1 on the easy listening chart?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brook Benton</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Initially, the vocalists consisted of artists such as Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis, Nat King Cole, Perry Como, and others.

Walter Sabo and his team at NBC brought in major personalities from the AM Band to the FM Band taking the format from a background to a foreground listening experience.

It is a form of neo soul R&amp;B that places emphasis on songcraft and sophistication. As the use of drum machines, synthesizers, and sequencers dominates R&amp;B-rooted music, adult contemporary R&amp;B tends to take most of its cues from the more refined strains of 1970s soul, such as smooth soul, Philly soul and quiet storm. Classic songwriting touches and organic-leaning instrumentation, often featuring string arrangements and horn charts, were constants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with soft AC, on what station format might adult contemporary R&amp;B be featured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">urban AC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What features are emphasized in adult contemporary R&amp;B music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">songcraft and sophistication</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with smooth soul and quiet storm, what genre influenced adult contemporary R&amp;B?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philly soul</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what decade was smooth soul popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with drum machines and synthesizers, what electronic instruments are often found in modern R&amp;B-based music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sequencers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1980s, lush jazz-R&amp;B fusion (George Benson, Patti Austin, Al Jarreau) and stylish crossover R&amp;B (Anita Baker and Luther Vandross, New Edition and Keith Sweat) were equally successful within the mainstream. In the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), artists as sonically contrasting as R. Kelly, Leona Lewis (mainly ballads) and Jill Scott both fit the bill, provided the audience for the material was mature. By riding and contributing to nearly all of the trends, no one has exemplified the style more than Babyface, whose career thrived over 20 years as a member of the Deele (Two Occasions), a solo artist (Whip Appeal, When Can I See You), and a songwriter/producer (Toni Braxton's Breathe Again, Boyz II Men's I'll Make Love to You).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What genre of music did Patti Austin perform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jazz-R&amp;B fusion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what genre was the musician Keith Sweat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">crossover R&amp;B</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what decade were musicians like Al Jarreau and Luther Vandross notably successful?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of songs was Leona Lewis known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ballads</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Boyz II Men's I'll Make Love to You?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Babyface</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has several subgenres, one being &quot;Christian AC&quot;.
