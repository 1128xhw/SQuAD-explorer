Civil law states do not tend to have singular highest courts. Additionally, the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the &quot;Supreme Court&quot;, for example, the High Court of Australia; this is because decisions by the High Court could formerly be appealed to the Privy Council. On the other hand, in some places the court named the &quot;Supreme Court&quot; is not in fact the highest court; examples include the New York Supreme Court, the Supreme Courts of several Canadian provinces/territories and the former Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, which are all superseded by higher Courts of Appeal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kinds of governed nations may not have a specific, individual high court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Civil law states</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a highest court not being specifically called a Supreme Court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the High Court of Australia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To which body can decisions made by this specific high court be appealed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Privy Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Canadian courts also are not specifically the highest courts in that country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Supreme Courts of several Canadian provinces/territories</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some countries have multiple &quot;supreme courts&quot; whose respective jurisdictions have different geographical extents, or which are restricted to particular areas of law.

Jurisdictions with a civil law system often have a hierarchy of administrative courts separate from the ordinary courts, headed by a supreme administrative court as it the case in the Netherlands.

The court's decisions are final and binding on the federal courts and the courts from all provinces and territories.

The final adjudication power, as in any other British Colonies, rested with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in London, United Kingdom. Now the power of final adjudication is vested in the Court of Final Appeal created in 1997. Under the Basic Law, its constitution, the territory remains a common law jurisdiction. Consequently, judges from other common law jurisdictions (including England and Wales) can be recruited and continue to serve in the judiciary according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. On the other hand, the power of interpretation of the Basic Law itself is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) in Beijing (without retroactive effect), and the courts are authorised to interpret the Basic Law when trying cases, in accordance with Article 158 of the Basic Law. This arrangement became controversial in light of the right of abode issue in 1999, raising concerns for judicial independence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Britain formally surrender sovreignty over Hong Kong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Hong Kong was a colony of Great Britain, which body was the highest court of appeal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the JCPC located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London, United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Court of Final Appeal established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is seated in what city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beijing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In India, the Supreme Court of India was created on January 28, 1950 after adoption of the Constitution.

It is the highest judicial instance. The Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem. The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State. A ruling of the Supreme Court is binding upon every court, other than the Supreme Court itself. The Israeli supreme court is both an appellate court and the high court of justice. As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (both criminal and civil) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts. It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association. As the High Court of Justice (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le'Zedek בית משפט גבוה לצדק; also known by its initials as Bagatz בג&quot;ץ), the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Knesset. The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal. The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments. The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment. In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled - whether as a court of appeals or as the High Court of Justice - with a panel of three or more justices, it may rule at a further hearing with a panel of a larger number of justices. A further hearing may be held if the Supreme Court makes a ruling inconsistent with a previous ruling or if the Court deems that the importance, difficulty or novelty of a ruling of the Court justifies such hearing. The Supreme Court also holds the unique power of being able to order &quot;trial de novo&quot; (a retrial).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Israel's Supreme Court located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jerusalem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Israel's Supreme Court fulfills what two major functions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both an appellate court and the high court of justice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Israel's legislative body is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Knesset</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Israel's Supreme court has uses what internal method to review its own decisions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a panel of three or more justices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A retrial is also called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;trial de novo&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The new Supreme Court of New Zealand was officially established at the beginning of 2004, although it did not come into operation until July.

Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified, the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court &quot;form part of the law of the land&quot;, belonging to the same class as statutes. The 1987 Philippine Constitution also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions.

In most cases, the Supreme Courts will only grant leave to appeal a case (prövningstillstånd) if the case involves setting a precedent in the interpretation of the law. Exceptions are issues where the Supreme Court is the court of first instance. Such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence, and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the Government for severe neglect of duty.
