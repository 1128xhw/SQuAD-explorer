In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno was sent to map the California coast. Arriving on his flagship San Diego, Vizcaíno surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for the Catholic Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego de Alcalá. On November 12, 1602, the first Christian religious service of record in Alta California was conducted by Friar Antonio de la Ascensión, a member of Vizcaíno's expedition, to celebrate the feast day of San Diego.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was sent to survey the California coast in 1602?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sebastián Vizcaíno</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the harbor named for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic Saint Didacus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who conducted the first Christian service to be recorded in Alta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Friar Antonio de la Ascensión</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo's ship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Salvador</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Cabrillo leave from to embark on his journey to the West Coast?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Navidad, New Spain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In May 1769, Gaspar de Portolà established the Fort Presidio of San Diego on a hill near the San Diego River.

In 1822, Mexico began attempting to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1833, and most of the Mission lands were sold to wealthy Californio settlers. The 432 residents of the town petitioned the governor to form a pueblo, and Juan María Osuna was elected the first alcalde (&quot;municipal magistrate&quot;), defeating Pío Pico in the vote. (See, List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego.) However, San Diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents. Beyond town Mexican land grants expanded the number of California ranchos that modestly added to the local economy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was elected as the Mission's first municipal magistrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Juan María Osuna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Mexican territory San Diego became part of in 1821?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alta California</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did San Diego lose its pueblo status in 1838?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened as the population shifted to more level ground below Presidio Hill?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was in the running for the first alcalde position, but was defeated in the election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pío Pico</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1846, the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California. At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commissioned Captain Archibald Gillespie to lead 50 men on horseback to the north?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Commodore Robert F.

In 1850, William Heath Davis promoted a new development by the Bay shore called &quot;New San Diego&quot;, several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only a few houses, a pier and an Army depot. In the late 1860s, Alonzo Horton promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called &quot;New Town&quot; and which became Downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because of its location on San Diego Bay convenient to shipping. New Town soon eclipsed the original settlement, known to this day as Old Town, and became the economic and governmental heart of the city.

The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past.

The San Diego River runs through the middle of San Diego from east to west, creating a river valley which serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments.

The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Rancho Bernardo.

In San Diego, this is mostly because of the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons).

Sometimes the June gloom can last into July, causing cloudy skies over most of San Diego for the entire day. Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas tend to experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. Thus, for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of 50 °F (10 °C) and August highs of 78 °F (26 °C).

Filner subsequently pleaded guilty to one felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges, and was sentenced to house arrest and probation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Mayor Bob Filner asked to resign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allegations of repeated sexual harassment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many women claimed to be sexually harassed by Filner?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Filner's sentence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">house arrest and probation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did a mediation process begin between Filner and a city representative?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 19</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Filner's trial last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six weeks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>San Diego was ranked as the 20th-safest city in America in 2013 by Business Insider. According to Forbes magazine, San Diego was the ninth-safest city in the top 10 list of safest cities in the U.S. in 2010. Like most major cities, San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000. Crime in San Diego increased in the early 2000s. In 2004, San Diego had the sixth lowest crime rate of any U.S. city with over half a million residents. From 2002 to 2006, the crime rate overall dropped 0.8%, though not evenly by category. While violent crime decreased 12.4% during this period, property crime increased 1.1%. Total property crimes per 100,000 people were lower than the national average in 2008.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the crime rate in San Diego between 1990 and 2000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Business Insider call San Diego in 2013?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20th-safest city in America</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what place did Forbes rank San Diego on it's top 10 list?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ninth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage did the crime rate in San Diego drop from 2002 to 2006?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">0.8%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of crime increased between 2002 and 2006?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">property crime</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>San Diego's first television station was KFMB, which began broadcasting on May 16, 1949. Since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed seven television stations in Los Angeles, two VHF channels were available for San Diego because of its relative proximity to the larger city. In 1952, however, the FCC began licensing UHF channels, making it possible for cities such as San Diego to acquire more stations. Stations based in Mexico (with ITU prefixes of XE and XH) also serve the San Diego market. Television stations today include XHTJB 3 (Once TV), XETV 6 (CW), KFMB 8 (CBS), KGTV 10 (ABC), XEWT 12 (Televisa Regional), KPBS 15 (PBS), KBNT-CD 17 (Univision), XHTIT-TDT 21 (Azteca 7), XHJK-TDT 27 (Azteca 13), XHAS 33 (Telemundo), K35DG-D 35 (UCSD-TV), KDTF-LD 51 (Telefutura), KNSD 39 (NBC), KZSD-LP 41 (Azteca America), KSEX-CD 42 (Infomercials), XHBJ-TDT 45 (Gala TV), XHDTV 49 (MNTV), KUSI 51 (Independent), XHUAA-TDT 57 (Canal de las Estrellas), and KSWB-TV 69 (Fox).

Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be utility cycling oriented. This is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common.
