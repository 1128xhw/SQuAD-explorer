Detroit's metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 5.3 million people, making it the fourteenth-most populous metropolitan area in the United States and the second-largest in the Midwestern United States (behind Chicago). It is a major port on the Detroit River, a strait that connects the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The City of Detroit anchors the second-largest economic region in the Midwest, behind Chicago, and the thirteenth-largest in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city has the biggest population in Michigan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Detroit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the county that Detroit is a part of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wayne County</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people inhabit metro Detroit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5.3 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the river that runs through Detroit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Detroit River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what region of the country is Detroit located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Midwest</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Detroit is the center of a three-county urban area (population 3,734,090, area of 1,337 square miles (3,460 km2), a 2010 United States Census) six-county metropolitan statistical area (2010 Census population of 4,296,250, area of 3,913 square miles [10,130 km2]), and a nine-county Combined Statistical Area (2010 Census population of 5,218,852, area of 5,814 square miles [15,060 km2]).

Between 2000 and 2010 the city's population fell by 25 percent, changing its ranking from the nation's 10th-largest city to 18th. In 2010, the city had a population of 713,777, more than a 60 percent drop from a peak population of over 1.8 million at the 1950 census. This resulted from suburbanization, industrial restructuring, and the decline of Detroit's auto industry. Following the shift of population and jobs to its suburbs or other states or nations, the city has focused on becoming the metropolitan region's employment and economic center. Downtown Detroit has held an increased role as an entertainment destination in the 21st century, with the restoration of several historic theatres, several new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. More recently, the population of Downtown Detroit, Midtown Detroit, and a handful of other neighborhoods has increased. Many other neighborhoods remain distressed, with extensive abandonment of properties.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By how much has Detroit's population fallen this century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The decline of what industry has hurt Detroit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">auto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What industry has Detroit tried to revitalize in recent years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">entertainment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the problems that currently effects property values in Detroit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abandonment of properties</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Governor of Michigan, Rick Snyder, declared a financial emergency for the city in March 2013, appointing an emergency manager.

The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. &quot;By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,&quot; whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence.

In 1976, the federal government offered $600 million for building a regional rapid transit system, under a single regional authority. But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit. Following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system, the City moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the Detroit People Mover.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first black mayor of Detroit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Coleman Young</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Detroit build after the failure of a larger regional transportation system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Detroit People Mover</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the federal government offer for a rapid transit system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$600 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Detroit argue with when trying to plane a regional transit system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">suburban neighbors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The gasoline crises of 1973 and 1979 also affected Detroit and the U.S. auto industry.

However, they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city—through violence, laws, and economic discrimination (e.g., redlining). White residents attacked black homes: breaking windows, starting fires, and exploding bombs. The pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs.

In the first decade of the 21st century, about two-thirds of the total black population in metropolitan area resided within the city limits of Detroit. The number of integrated neighborhoods has increased from 100 in 2000 to 204 in 2010. The city has also moved down the ranking, from number one most segregated to number four. A 2011 op-ed in The New York Times attributed the decreased segregation rating to the overall exodus from the city, cautioning that these areas may soon become more segregated. This pattern already happened in the 1970s, when apparent integration was actually a precursor to white flight and resegregation. Over a 60-year period, white flight occurred in the city. According to an estimate of the Michigan Metropolitan Information Center, from 2008 to 2009 the percentage of non-Hispanic White residents increased from 8.4% to 13.3%.
