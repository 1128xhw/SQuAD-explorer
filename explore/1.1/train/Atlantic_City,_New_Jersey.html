In an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation, White hired the architectural firm of Price and McLanahan. The firm made use of reinforced concrete, a new building material invented by Jean-Louis Lambot in 1848 (Joseph Monier received the patent in 1867). The hotel's Spanish and Moorish themes, capped off with its signature dome and chimneys, represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence.

It was during Prohibition that racketeer and political boss Enoch L. &quot;Nucky&quot; Johnson rose to power. Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City, and, because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments, the resort's popularity grew further. The city then dubbed itself as &quot;The World's Playground&quot;. Nucky Johnson's income, which reached as much as $500,000 annually, came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor, gambling and prostitution operating in the city, as well as from kickbacks on construction projects.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years do many historians consider Atlantic City's golden age?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1920s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Prohibition enacted nationally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During Prohibition what name was given to Atlantic City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The World's Playground</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During Prohibition how high was Nucky Johnson's income?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as much as $500,000 annually</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Prohibition last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">until 1933</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During this time, Atlantic City was under the mayoral reign of Edward L.

The neighborhood known as the &quot;Inlet&quot; became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. First of all, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. But perhaps the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from cheap, fast jet service to other premier resorts, such as Miami Beach and the Bahamas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Atlantic City neighborhood became particularly impoverished in the mid-to-late 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;Inlet&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cheap, fast jet service</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were two other locations people began to fly to instead of going to Atlantic City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miami Beach and the Bahamas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the war, what form of transportation became more readily available to many Americans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">automobile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two luxuries that people could have at their own homes led to a diminished interest in luxury beach resorts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">home air conditioning and swimming pools</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city hosted the 1964 Democratic National Convention which nominated Lyndon Johnson for President and Hubert Humphrey as Vice President.

Most of them were either shut down, converted to cheap apartments, or converted to nursing home facilities by the end of the decade. Prior to and during the advent of legalized gaming, many of these hotels were demolished. The Breakers, the Chelsea, the Brighton, the Shelburne, the Mayflower, the Traymore, and the Marlborough-Blenheim were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Of the many pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk, only the Claridge, the Dennis, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Haddon Hall survive to this day as parts of Bally's Atlantic City, a condo complex, and Resorts Atlantic City. The old Ambassador Hotel was purchased by Ramada in 1978 and was gutted to become the Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, only reusing the steelwork of the original building.

Immediately after the legislation passed, the owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the Resorts International. It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26, 1978. Other casinos were soon constructed along the Boardwalk and, later, in the marina district for a total of eleven today. The introduction of gambling did not, however, quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City. Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems, as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods. In addition, Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas, as a gambling city in the United States. Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract customers to his casinos. The boxer Mike Tyson had most of his fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s, which helped Atlantic City achieve nationwide attention as a gambling resort. Numerous highrise condominiums were built for use as permanent residences or second homes. By end of the decade it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did New Jersey voters pass a referendum approving casino gambling for Atlantic City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1976</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel converted it into what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Resorts International</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first legal casino in the eastern United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Resorts International</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Resorts International open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1978</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many casinos are there in Atlantic City today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eleven</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the redevelopment of Las Vegas and the opening of two casinos in Connecticut in the early 1990s, along with newly built casinos in the nearby Philadelphia metro area in the 2000s, Atlantic City's tourism began to decline due to its failure to diversify away from gaming. Determined to expand, in 1999 the Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority partnered with Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn to develop a new roadway to a barren section of the city near the Marina. Nicknamed &quot;The Tunnel Project&quot;, Steve Wynn planned the proposed 'Mirage Atlantic City' around the idea that he would connect the $330 million tunnel stretching 2.5 miles (4.0 km) from the Atlantic City Expressway to his new resort. The roadway was later officially named the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, and funnels incoming traffic off of the expressway into the city's marina district and Brigantine, New Jersey.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Atlantic City's tourism began to decline due to what failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to diversify away from gaming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority partner with in 1999?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steve Wynn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority partner with Steve Wynn?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to develop a new roadway</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the project involving Steve Wynn nicknamed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Tunnel Project</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">&quot;The Tunnel Project&quot; was later officially named what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although Wynn's plans for development in the city were scrapped in 2002, the tunnel opened in 2001.

Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it &quot;strongly&quot; opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September 2, 2014.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Morgan Stanley purchase land for a new casino resort?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much land did Morgan Stanley purchase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 acres</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was named as the developer for Morgan Stanley's casino resort?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Revel Entertainment Group</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of ownership did Morgan Stanley hold in Revel Entertainment Group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Governor Chris Christie</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the wake of the closures and declining revenue from casinos, Governor Christie said in September 2014 that the state would consider a 2015 referendum to end the 40-year-old monopoly that Atlantic City holds on casino gambling and allowing gambling in other municipalities.

Near the coast, temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on an average of only 6.8 days a year, but this reaches 21 days at nearby Atlantic City Int'l.[a] Winters are cool, with January averaging 35.5 °F (2 °C). Spring and autumn are erratic, although they are usually mild with low humidity. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 20 to March 25, allowing a growing season of 239 days. Extreme temperatures range from −9 °F (−23 °C) on February 9, 1934 to 104 °F (40 °C) on August 7, 1918.[b]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the daily average temperature in July?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">75.6 °F</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Atlantic City is a prime place to beat the heat from June through what month?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average temperature for January in Atlantic City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35.5 °F</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the extreme low temperature of Atlantic City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">−9 °F</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many days long is the growing season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">239 days</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Annual precipitation is 40 inches (1,020 mm) which is fairly spread throughout the year.
