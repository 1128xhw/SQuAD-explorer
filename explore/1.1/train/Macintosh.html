Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the 1990s, improvements in the rival Wintel platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, then Windows 95, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium, and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after a transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh (later renamed the PowerMac, in line with the PowerBook series) line in 1994, the falling prices of commodity PC components and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What hindered the competetive ability of Apple when it was introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">expensive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Macintosh initially find success in the market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">education and desktop publishing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which platform, when improved in the 1990's, took market share from Macintosh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wintel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of advantage did Intel's Pentium over Macintosh systems in the 1990's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">performance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became the top PC manufacturer in 1994, leaving Apple in 3rd place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Compaq</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64 kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's Motorola 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from 5 MHz to 8 MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64 kB of ROM – far more than most other computers; it had 128 kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64 kilobit (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Though there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512 kB by means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256 kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a 9-inch, 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much RAM did the first Maciuntosh board have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">64 kilobytes (kB)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose idea was it to run Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bud Tribble, a member of the Mac team</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Tribble first incorporate into the Mac?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lisa's Motorola 68000 microprocessor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which design feature did Smith eventually use to make production of a newly designed board more cost-efficient?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fewer RAM chips than the Lisa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What feature was missing from the final Mac design produced by Smith?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">memory slots</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Apple spent $2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special, post-election issue of Newsweek, and ran a &quot;Test Drive a Macintosh&quot; promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US$1,995 to US$2,495 (about $5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010). The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year. By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did Apple spend to advertise in a special post-election issue of Newsweek?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$2.5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the big promotion Apple ran in the special edition of Newsweek?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Test Drive a Macintosh&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Apple allow potential buyers to take home and try for 24 hours?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Macintosh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were many computers returned during the Test Drive a Macintosh promotion that made them unsellable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a bad condition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the CEO of Apple during the Test Drive a Macintosh promotion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Sculley</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Apple released the Macintosh Plus on January 10, 1986, for a price of US$2,600. It offered one megabyte of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes by the use of socketed RAM boards. It also featured a SCSI parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its floppy drive was increased to an 800 kB capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history. In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled HyperCard and MultiFinder, which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history while it was in production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Mac Plus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the Mac Plus remain in production, unchanged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">just over four years and ten months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1986, what did Apple introduce to allow developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Macintosh Programmer's Workshop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Apple's HyerCard and MultiFinder add to the Macintosh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cooperative multitasking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After their unveiling in 1987, what did Apple begin bundling with every Macintosh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">HyperCard and MultiFinder</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the new Motorola 68030 processor came the Macintosh IIx in 1988, which had benefited from internal improvements, including an on-board MMU. It was followed in 1989 by the Macintosh IIcx, a more compact version with fewer slots  and a version of the Mac SE powered by the 16 MHz 68030, the Macintosh SE/30. Later that year, the Macintosh IIci, running at 25 MHz, was the first Mac to be &quot;32-bit clean.&quot; This allowed it to natively support more than 8 MB of RAM, unlike its predecessors, which had &quot;32-bit dirty&quot; ROMs (8 of the 32 bits available for addressing were used for OS-level flags). System 7 was the first Macintosh operating system to support 32-bit addressing. The following year, the Macintosh IIfx, starting at US$9,900, was unveiled. Apart from its fast 40 MHz 68030 processor, it had significant internal architectural improvements, including faster memory and two Apple II CPUs (6502s) dedicated to I/O processing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Macintosh first included an on-board MMU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Macintosh IIx</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first Mac to be &quot;32-bit clean&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Macintosh IIci</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the starting price of the Macintosh llfx when it was unveiled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$9,900</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Apple II CPUS's did the new Macintosh llfx include?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How fast was the processor on the new Macintosh llfx?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">40 MHz</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As for Mac OS, System 7 was a 32-bit rewrite from Pascal to C++ that introduced virtual memory and improved the handling of color graphics, as well as memory addressing, networking, and co-operative multitasking.

Since Apple had licensed only System 7 to third parties, this move effectively ended the clone line. The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like Motorola, who produced the StarMax; Umax, who produced the SuperMac; and Power Computing, who offered several lines of Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro. These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware. Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not. In September 1997 Apple extended Umax' license allowing them to sell clones with Mac OS 8, the only clone maker to do so, but with the restriction that they only sell low-end systems. Without the higher profit margins of high-end systems, however, Umax judged this would not be profitable and exited the Mac clone market in May 1998, having lost USD$36 million on the program.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who returned to Apple in 1997?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steve Jobs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Steve Jobs order the OS version 7.7 to be branded as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mac OS 8</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the branding of the Mac OS 8 effectively end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the clone line</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What effect did Mac's decision to brand the Mac OS8 have on companies such as Motorola?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">significant financial losses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did Umax lose when it exited the low-end Mac clone market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">USD$36 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mac OS continued to evolve up to version 9.2.2, including retrofits such as the addition of a nanokernel and support for Multiprocessing Services 2.0 in Mac OS 8.6, though its dated architecture made replacement necessary. Initially developed in the Pascal programming language, it was substantially rewritten in C++ for System 7. From its beginnings on an 8 MHz machine with 128 KB of RAM, it had grown to support Apple's latest 1 GHz G4-equipped Macs. Since its architecture was laid down, features that were already common on Apple's competition, like preemptive multitasking and protected memory, had become feasible on the kind of hardware Apple manufactured. As such, Apple introduced Mac OS X, a fully overhauled Unix-based successor to Mac OS 9. OS X uses Darwin, XNU, and Mach as foundations, and is based on NeXTSTEP. It was released to the public in September 2000, as the Mac OS X Public Beta, featuring a revamped user interface called &quot;Aqua&quot;. At US$29.99, it allowed adventurous Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release. The initial version of Mac OS X, 10.0 &quot;Cheetah&quot;, was released on March 24, 2001. Older Mac OS applications could still run under early Mac OS X versions, using an environment called &quot;Classic&quot;. Subsequent releases of Mac OS X included 10.1 &quot;Puma&quot; (2001), 10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; (2002), 10.3 &quot;Panther&quot; (2003) and 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; (2005).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did dated architecture on the Mac OS line make necessary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">replacement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What programming language was the Mac OS initially developed in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pascal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language replaced Pascal for System 7?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">C++</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the fuly overhauled successor to Mac OS 9?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mac OS X</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Upon release, what interface allowed Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aqua</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The current Mac product family uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8 GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4 GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the MacBook (2015 version), which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only mainstream computer platform to successfully transition to a new CPU architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Macintosh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the standard amount of RAM included with almost all current Mac models?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8 GB</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which MacBook Pro port can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thunderbolt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the iMac G5 released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which interface did Apple introduce that was capable of being operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Front Row</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the standard amount of RAM shipped with most Mac models?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8 GB</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What processors are used by the current Mac product family?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Intel x86-64</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many data transfer ports are included in most current Macs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Apple, how fast can the Thunderbolt port transfer data?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up to 10 gigabits per second.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Originally, the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the Mac OS operating system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system.

The launch of the Macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products, including the &quot;multiple exclusive,&quot; event marketing (credited to John Sculley, who brought the concept over from Pepsi), creating a mystique around a product and giving an inside look into a product's creation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was brought in to shape the marketing of Macintosh in 1982?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Regis McKenna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What role did Andy Cunningham and Jane Anderson have in the Macintosh launch plan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">primary authors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who introduced the &quot;multiple exclusive&quot; event marketing concept to Apple?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Sculley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company first used the &quot;multiple exclusive&quot; event marketing concept?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pepsi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the &quot;multiple exclusive&quot; event marketing concept create around a product?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a mystique</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Compaq, who had previously held the third place spot among PC manufacturers during the 1980s and early-mid 1990s, initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end, overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place.

This was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984, Microsoft's MultiPlan migrated over from MS-DOS, with Microsoft Word following in January 1985. In 1985, Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz for the Macintosh platform after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.

While sales of the Macintosh have largely held steady, in comparison to Apple's sales of the iPhone and iPad which increased significantly during the 2010s, Macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis, with the majority being their MacBooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of PCs. It also helped that the Macintosh lineup is simple, updated on a yearly schedule, and consistent across both Apple retail stores, and authorized resellers where they have a special &quot;store within a store&quot; section to distinguish them from Windows PCs. In contrast, Windows PC manufacturers generally have a wide range of offerings, selling only a portion through retail with a full selection on the web, and often with limited-time or region-specific models. The Macintosh ranked third on the &quot;list of intended brands for desktop purchases&quot; for the 2011 holiday season, then moved up to second in 2012 by displacing Hewlett Packard, and in 2013 took the top spot ahead of Dell.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to NPD, who has generally dominated the premium PC market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apple</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Macintosh ranked on the &quot;list of intended brands for desktop purchases&quot; for the 2011 holiday season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Macintosh displace from 2nd place on the 2012 holiday season &quot;list of intended brands for desktop purchases&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hewlett Packard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Macintosh displace from 1st place on the 2013 holiday season &quot;list of intended brands for desktop purchases&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Apple's products is focused on the ultraportable niche of PC's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MacBooks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily.

Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in February 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware. Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks. Apple releases security updates for its software. In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks, and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input. Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem.

Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the market share of OS X in North America by March 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">slightly over 14%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Being positioned as a higher end PC, what is it misleading to compare the Mac to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a budget PC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Apple has remained profitable since what time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steve Jobs' return</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to market research, who does Apple draw it's customer base from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a higher-income demographic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose return to Apple resulted in the company's reorganization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steve Jobs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the Macintosh platform, their systems remained fairly expensive, making them less competitive in light of the falling costs of components that made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption. In 1989, Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins. Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier Macintosh. Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers; at one point the product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers in 1989?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean-Louis Gassée</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What problem rocked the PC industry in 1989?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a component shortage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the component shortage of 1989 force Allan Loren to do with Macs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cut prices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Allan Loren?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apple USA head</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Microsoft Windows 3.0 released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 1990</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Starting in 2002, Apple moved to eliminate CRT displays from its product line as part of aesthetic design and space-saving measures with the iMac G4. However, the new iMac with its flexible LCD flat-panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding iMac G3, largely due to the higher cost of the LCD technology at the time. In order to keep the Macintosh affordable for the education market and due to obsolescence of the iMac G3, Apple created the eMac in April 2002 as the intended successor; however the eMac's CRT made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated, while its all-in-one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors. The iMac G4's relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution LCD screens. Meanwhile, Windows PC manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with LCD flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at much lower cost than the iMac G4. The flop of the Power Mac G4 Cube, along with the more expensive iMac G4 and heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3. For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be the iPod portable music player and iTunes music download service that would drive Apple's sales growth.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Apple begin to eliminate in 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CRT displays</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the new iMac G4 considerably more expensive than the G3?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">higher cost of the LCD technology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Apple create the more affordable eMac in April 2002 for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the education market</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main problem with the eMac's CRT?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relatively bulky and somewhat outdated</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After Apple's failed desktop sales, what products drove their sales growth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the iPod portable music player and iTunes music download service</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The sales breakdown of the Macintosh have seen sales of desktop Macs stayed mostly constant while being surpassed by that of Mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably; seven out of ten Macs sold were laptops in 2009, a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by 2010.

By contrast the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a Mac, with the exception of the even more inexpensive Mac Mini (the only sub-$1000 offering from Apple, albeit without a monitor and keyboard), not surprisingly the MacBooks are the top-selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today.

Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the &quot;Snow White&quot; design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers. However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985. He went on to found NeXT, another computer company targeting the education market, and did not return until 1997, when Apple acquired NeXT.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Raskin leave the Apple team in 1981?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over a personality conflict with Jobs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Andy Hertzfeld, whose idea is the final Mac design closer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jobs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Steve Jobs offer Xerox to visit and see their latest technology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apple stock options</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose technology influenced the user interfaces of the Lisa and Macintosh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xerox PARC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused Steve Jobs to resign from Apple in 1985?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an internal power struggle</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jobs stated during the Macintosh's introduction &quot;we expect Macintosh to become the third industry standard&quot;, after the Apple II and IBM PC.

Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud. One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty.

Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months. However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against &quot;the Dells of the world&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Intel unsuccessfully try to push Apple to migrate to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Intel chips</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which platform did Apple choose to use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Motorola 68040</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first rolled out Pentium processors in 1993?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Intel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far behind was Macintosh set back compared to the new IBM compatibles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a generation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Apple abandon Motorola CPU's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1994</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1998, Apple introduced its new iMac which, like the original 128K Mac, was an all-in-one computer.

The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of two USB ports. It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days. It made the company an annual profit of US$309 million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995. This aesthetic was applied to the Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's &quot;four-square product matrix&quot; (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals).

In March 2006, a group of hackers announced that they were able to run Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac.

In particular, Intel-based macs lack the A20 gate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of software began to emerge following the release of Intel-based Macs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">third-party platform virtualization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what speed do programs such as VirtualBox allow Microsoft Windows to run on Macs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at near native speed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is possible to run by using Boot camp, even though it is not condoned by Apple?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Linux operating system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Macs lack that makes them unable to run many legacy PC operating systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the A20 gate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although the PC market declined, Apple still managed to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 (the majority of which are the MacBook Air) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks, although there were dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the MacBook Air. The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to &quot;OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction&quot;. The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years. Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors, though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air. The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established &quot;elitist aura&quot; perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been the best-selling ultra-portable over Windows Ultrabooks in the U.S.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MacBook Air</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What earned the title as best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MacBook Air</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Air receive before other PC manufacturers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Intel's latest CPUs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Through 7/1/13, what percentage of all Ultrabook sales in the U.S. were MacBook Airs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">56</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the competetive pricing of MacBooks especially effective?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
