Prices for renewable energy technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">renewable energy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is becoming increasingly economic in both developing and devloped countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Renewables</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of 2012, prices for what commodity continued to drop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">renewable energy technologies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>United Nations' Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that &quot;renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity&quot;.

Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4 billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3 billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2012, solar electricity consumption increased by what percentage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">58 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Use of wind power in 2012 increased by what percentage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18.1 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was the worldwide investment in solar power in 2012?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$140.4 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Analysts expect the market to triple by what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2030</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did investment in renewables exceed fossils?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2015</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and Robert H. Socolow have developed a series of &quot;stabilization wedges&quot; that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and &quot;renewable energy sources,&quot; in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their &quot;wedges.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What motivated the incentive to use 100 percent renewable energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">global warming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many nations already have renewable energy contributing to more than 20 percent of energy supply?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at least 30 nations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed a series of stabilization wedges?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Professors S.
