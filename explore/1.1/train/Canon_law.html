It is the internal ecclesiastical law governing the Catholic Church (both Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches), the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion. The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the foundation of canon law.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name for the rules issued by the heads of the Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canon law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what type of religion are canon laws applicable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which institutions make up the Catholic Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What body was first responsible for creating canon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">church council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does canon law consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">canons</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Greek kanon / Ancient Greek: κανών, Arabic Qanun / قانون, Hebrew kaneh / קנה, &quot;straight&quot;; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is &quot;reed&quot; (cf. the Romance-language ancestors of the English word &quot;cane&quot;).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Greek term for canon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kanon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Hebrew term for canon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kaneh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Arabic term meaning canon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qanun</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the common definition of the word canon as it appears in Greek, Arabic and Hebrew?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which English term is derived from the same root as the Greek, Arabic and Hebrew words for canon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cane</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Apostolic Canons or Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles is a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees (eighty-five in the Eastern, fifty in the Western Church) concerning the government and discipline of the Early Christian Church, incorporated with the Apostolic Constitutions which are part of the Ante-Nicene Fathers In the fourth century the First Council of Nicaea (325) calls canons the disciplinary measures of the Church: the term canon, κανὠν, means in Greek, a rule.

Some Orthodox canon scholars point out that, had the Ecumenical Councils (which deliberated in Greek) meant for the canons to be used as laws, they would have called them nómoi/νόμοι (laws) rather than kanónes/κανόνες (rules), but almost all Orthodox conform to them. The dogmatic decisions of the Councils, though, are to be obeyed rather than to be treated as guidelines, since they are essential for the Church's unity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language is used by members of the Orthodox denomination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the constituents of the Pēdálion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">canons and commentaries upon them</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Pēdálion mean in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rudder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Orthodox leaders are free to adapt canon as required?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bishops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which groups do Orthodox scholars point to when defending their way of interpreting canon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ecumenical Councils</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Church of England, the ecclesiastical courts that formerly decided many matters such as disputes relating to marriage, divorce, wills, and defamation, still have jurisdiction of certain church-related matters (e.g. discipline of clergy, alteration of church property, and issues related to churchyards). Their separate status dates back to the 12th century when the Normans split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons. In contrast to the other courts of England the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a civil law system, not common law, although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes. Since the Reformation, ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts. The teaching of canon law at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge was abrogated by Henry VIII; thereafter practitioners in the ecclesiastical courts were trained in civil law, receiving a Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree from Oxford, or a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree from Cambridge. Such lawyers (called &quot;doctors&quot; and &quot;civilians&quot;) were centered at &quot;Doctors Commons&quot;, a few streets south of St Paul's Cathedral in London, where they monopolized probate, matrimonial, and admiralty cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the common law courts in the mid-19th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what institution do church courts still have relevant functions in secular society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Church of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did Saxons and Normans separate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of law is not found in ecclesiastical systems in the modern day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">common law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At which universities were canon law degrees abolished?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oxford and Cambridge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for banning canon law education from Oxford and Cambridge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry VIII</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Other churches in the Anglican Communion around the world (e.g., the Episcopal Church in the United States, and the Anglican Church of Canada) still function under their own private systems of canon law.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a term for the Church of England and churches that align with it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Anglican Communion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a member of the Anglican Communion in America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Episcopal Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a member of the Anglican Communion in Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Anglican Church of Canada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do extant churches of the Anglican Communion still operate with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their own private systems of canon law</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Currently, (2004), there are principles of canon law common to the churches within the Anglican Communion; their existence can be factually established; each province or church contributes through its own legal system to the principles of canon law common within the Communion; these principles have a strong persuasive authority and are fundamental to the self-understanding of each of the churches of the Communion; these principles have a living force, and contain in themselves the possibility of further development; and the existence of these principles both demonstrates unity and promotes unity within the Anglican Communion. </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of 2004, what do all Anglican Communion Churches share?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">principles of canon law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term characterizes the way in which the existence of canon principles can be shown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">factually</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Through what does each member of the Anglican Communion make a contribution to Church law?
