Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was the fourth of fourteen children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy. He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a number of posts, including papal nuncio in France and a delegate to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. In a consistory on 12 January 1953 Pope Pius XII made Roncalli a cardinal as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in addition to naming him as the Patriarch of Venice.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Pope Saint John XXIII's birth name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Pope Saint John XXIII born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25 November 1881</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Pope Saint XXIII die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 June 1963</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did he reign as Pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28 October 1958 to his death in 1963</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was he ordained to the priesthood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 August 1904</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Roncalli was elected pope on 28 October 1958 at age 76 after 11 ballots.

He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of &quot;John&quot; upon election in more than 500 years, and his choice settled the complicated question of official numbering attached to this papal name due to the antipope of this name. Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962–65), the first session opening on 11 October 1962. His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement, &quot;We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike.&quot; John XXIII made many passionate speeches during his pontificate, one of which was on the day that he opened the Second Vatican Council in the middle of the night to the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square: &quot;Dear children, returning home, you will find children: give your children a hug and say: This is a hug from the Pope!&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Roncalli when elected pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">76</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Roncalli elected pope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28 October 1958</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of &quot;John&quot; upon election in how long?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">500 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second Vatican Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did he call the Second Vatican Council?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11 October 1962</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pope John XXIII did not live to see the Vatican Council to completion.

He was buried in the Vatican grottoes beneath Saint Peter's Basilica on 6 June 1963 and his cause for canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by his successor, Pope Paul VI, who declared him a Servant of God. In addition to being named Venerable on 20 December 1999, he was beatified on 3 September 2000 by Pope John Paul II alongside Pope Pius IX and three others. Following his beatification, his body was moved on 3 June 2001 from its original place to the altar of Saint Jerome where it could be seen by the faithful. On 5 July 2013, Pope Francis – bypassing the traditionally required second miracle – declared John XXIII a saint, after unanimous agreement by a consistory, or meeting, of the College of Cardinals, based on the fact that he was considered to have lived a virtuous, model lifestyle, and because of the good for the Church which had come from his having opened the Second Vatican Council. He was canonised alongside Pope Saint John Paul II on 27 April 2014. John XXIII today is affectionately known as the &quot;Good Pope&quot; and in Italian, &quot;il Papa buono&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the pope die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 June 1963</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the pope die of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stomach cancer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was he buried?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Vatican grottoes beneath Saint Peter's Basilica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was he beatified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 September 2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">He is still known today as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;Good Pope&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Roman Catholic Church celebrates his feast day not on the date of his death, June 3, as is usual, nor even on the day of his papal inauguration (as is sometimes done with Popes who are Saints, such as with John Paul II) but on 11 October, the day of the first session of the Second Vatican Council.

His nomination as apostolic visitor was made official on 19 March. Roncalli was consecrated by Giovanni Tacci Porcelli in the church of San Carlo alla Corso in Rome. After he was consecrated, he introduced his family to Pope Pius XI. He chose as his episcopal motto Obedientia et Pax (&quot;Obedience and Peace&quot;), which became his guiding motto.
