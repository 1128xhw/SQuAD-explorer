A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, SAP HANA, and IBM DB2. A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMS can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS. Database management systems are often classified according to the database model that they support; the most popular database systems since the 1980s have all supported the relational model as represented by the SQL language.[disputed â€“ discuss] Sometimes a DBMS is loosely referred to as a 'database'.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does DBMS stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">database management system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of a DBMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most popular DBMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">SQL language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are DBMSs classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">according to the database model that they support</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Formally, a &quot;database&quot; refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to these data is usually provided by a &quot;database management system&quot; (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is data accessed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by a &quot;database management system&quot; (DBMS)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much data can a DBMS store?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large quantities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A DBMS consists of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an integrated set of computer software</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable storage. RAID is used for recovery of data if any of the disks fail. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions. from databases before the inception of Structured Query Language (SQL). The data recovered was disparate, redundant and disorderly, since there was no proper method to fetch it and arrange it in a concrete structure.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do most database applications contain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DBMSs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used to recover data if disks suffer a failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RAID</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can large quantities of data be accessed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hardware database accelerators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is required for a modern DBMS to function?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">standard operating system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A DBMS has evolved into a complex software system and its development typically requires thousands of human years of development effort.[a] Some general-purpose DBMSs such as Adabas, Oracle and DB2 have been undergoing upgrades since the 1970s. General-purpose DBMSs aim to meet the needs of as many applications as possible, which adds to the complexity. However, the fact that their development cost can be spread over a large number of users means that they are often the most cost-effective approach. However, a general-purpose DBMS is not always the optimal solution: in some cases a general-purpose DBMS may introduce unnecessary overhead. Therefore, there are many examples of systems that use special-purpose databases. A common example is an email system that performs many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as the insertion and deletion of messages composed of various items of data or associating messages with a particular email address; but these functions are limited to what is required to handle email and don't provide the user with all of the functionality that would be available using a general-purpose DBMS.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long can it take to create a DBMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thousands of human years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name three DBMSs that have been used since the 1970s.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adabas, Oracle and DB2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the cost to create a DBMS distributed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spread over a large number of users</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name an example of a general-purpose DBMS.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an email system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many other databases have application software that accesses the database on behalf of end-users, without exposing the DBMS interface directly. Application programmers may use a wire protocol directly, or more likely through an application programming interface. Database designers and database administrators interact with the DBMS through dedicated interfaces to build and maintain the applications' databases, and thus need some more knowledge and understanding about how DBMSs operate and the DBMSs' external interfaces and tuning parameters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are many databases accessed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">application software</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do administrators work with the DBMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through dedicated interfaces</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a way for programmers to use the DBMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wire protocol</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2015[update] they remain dominant : IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server are the top DBMS. The dominant database language, standardised SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the relational model of DBMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edgar F.

IMS was a development of software written for the Apollo program on the System/360. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL's network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed, and Bachman's 1973 Turing Award presentation was The Programmer as Navigator. IMS is classified[by whom?] as a hierarchical database. IDMS and Cincom Systems' TOTAL database are classified as network databases. IMS remains in use as of 2014[update].</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the DBMS created by IBM called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Information Management System (IMS)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the purpose of the IBM DBMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Apollo program</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the classification of IMS?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hierarchical database</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Bachman's Turing Award presentation in 1973?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Programmer as Navigator</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a &quot;table&quot; of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing &quot;sparse&quot; databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty. The relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables (or relations), with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed. Data may be freely inserted, deleted and edited in these tables, with the DBMS doing whatever maintenance needed to present a table view to the application/user.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who proposed using a table to store data?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Codd</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is data accessed in a table?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A linked-list system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What model solved the problem of databases where information was missing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relational</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What system assists a user in seeing a table?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DBMS</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers. The relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship, like a traditional hierarchical model, and many-to-many relationship, like a navigational (network) model. Thus, a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models, as well as its native tabular model, allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models, as the application requires.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was the relational model able to improve over time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">without constant rewriting of links and pointers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the relationship called in a hierarchical model?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one-to-many</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the relationship called in a navigational model?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">many-to-many</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a third type of model that can be combined with heirarchical and navigation models?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tabular</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers.

Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields. The term &quot;object-relational impedance mismatch&quot; described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object databases and object-relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known as object-relational mappings (ORMs) attempt to solve the same problem.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 1990s, what type of programming changed the handling of databases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">object-oriented</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is used for the difficulty in database table and programmed object translation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">object-relational impedance mismatch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the problem of object-relational impedance mismatch corrected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">object-oriented language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the library programmers use to solve object-relational impedance mismatch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">object-relational mappings (ORMs)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>

A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation, like &quot;can a customer also be a supplier?&quot;, or &quot;if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?&quot;, or &quot;if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?&quot;.
