It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover—George I, George II, George III, and George IV—who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830. The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture. In America the term &quot;Georgian&quot; is generally used to describe all building from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are &quot;architectural in intention&quot;, and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers a wide range.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the British monarchs of the House of Hanover from August 1714 to June 1830?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George I, George II, George III, and George IV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the 19th century revival of Georgian architecture in the United States referred to as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colonial Revival</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between what years was Georgian architecture in style?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between 1714 and 1830</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name given to the 20th century Great British revival Georgian architecture.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neo-Georgian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the house of the monarchs in power from 1714 and 1830?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Hanover</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The style of Georgian buildings is very variable, but marked by a taste for symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome, as revived in Renaissance architecture. Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition, but typically rather restrained, and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior. The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before, replacing English vernacular architecture (or becoming the new vernacular style) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What classical architecture is Georgian architecture based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greece and Rome</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of architecture did Georgian replace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English vernacular architecture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is ornament typically not found in Georgian architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the exterior</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In towns, which expanded greatly during the period, landowners turned into property developers, and rows of identical terraced houses became the norm. Even the wealthy were persuaded to live in these in town, especially if provided with a square of garden in front of the house. There was an enormous amount of building in the period, all over the English-speaking world, and the standards of construction were generally high. Where they have not been demolished, large numbers of Georgian buildings have survived two centuries or more, and they still form large parts of the core of cities such as London, Edinburgh, Dublin and Bristol.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the period of Georgian architecture what did landowners turn into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">property developers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do many buildings constructed during the period of Georgian architecture still exist today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London, Edinburgh, Dublin and Bristol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What benefit convinced many wealthy people to move into town during this time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a square of garden</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the world was mostly dominated by Georgian architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all over the English-speaking world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What quality were the buildings constructed during that time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">generally high</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The period saw the growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession; before the mid-century &quot;the high-sounding title, 'architect' was adopted by anyone who could get away with it&quot;. But most buildings were still designed by builders and landlords together, and the wide spread of Georgian architecture, and the Georgian styles of design more generally, came from dissemination through pattern books and inexpensive suites of engravings. This contrasted with earlier styles, which were primarily disseminated among craftsmen through the direct experience of the apprenticeship system. Authors such as the prolific William Halfpenny (active 1723–1755) received editions in America as well as Britain. From the mid-18th century, Georgian styles were assimilated into an architectural vernacular that became part and parcel of the training of every architect, designer, builder, carpenter, mason and plasterer, from Edinburgh to Maryland.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What high sounding title was adopted by anyone who could get away with it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">architect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did most Georgian design styles disseminate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pattern books and inexpensive suites of engravings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did styles disseminate before Georgian architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the apprenticeship system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which American author received editions of Georgian architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Halfpenny</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years were William Halfpenny active?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1723–1755</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Georgian succeeded the English Baroque of Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John Vanbrugh, Thomas Archer, William Talman, and Nicholas Hawksmoor; this in fact continued into at least the 1720s, overlapping with a more restrained Georgian style. The architect James Gibbs was a transitional figure, his earlier buildings are Baroque, reflecting the time he spent in Rome in the early 18th century, but he adjusted his style after 1720. Major architects to promote the change in direction from baroque were Colen Campbell, author of the influential book Vitruvius Britannicus (1715-1725); Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and his protégé William Kent; Isaac Ware; Henry Flitcroft and the Venetian Giacomo Leoni, who spent most of his career in England. Other prominent architects of the early Georgian period include James Paine, Robert Taylor, and John Wood, the Elder. The European Grand Tour became very common for wealthy patrons in the period, and Italian influence remained dominant, though at the start of the period Hanover Square, Westminster (1713 on), developed and occupied by Whig supporters of the new dynasty, seems to have deliberately adopted German stylisic elements in their honour, especially vertical bands connecting the windows.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What style did Georgian succeed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English Baroque</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which architect was a transitional figure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Gibbs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What became very popular with wealthy patrons during this period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The European Grand Tour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which book did Colen Campbell write?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vitruvius Britannicus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Venetian spent most of his career in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Giacomo Leoni</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The styles that resulted fall within several categories. In the mainstream of Georgian style were both Palladian architecture— and its whimsical alternatives, Gothic and Chinoiserie, which were the English-speaking world's equivalent of European Rococo. From the mid-1760s a range of Neoclassical modes were fashionable, associated with the British architects Robert Adam, James Gibbs, Sir William Chambers, James Wyatt, George Dance the Younger, Henry Holland and Sir John Soane. John Nash was one of the most prolific architects of the late Georgian era known as The Regency style, he was responsible for designing large areas of London. Greek Revival architecture was added to the repertory, beginning around 1750, but increasing in popularity after 1800.

Regularity, as with ashlar (uniformly cut) stonework, was strongly approved, imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules: the lack of symmetry, where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible, was deeply felt as a flaw, at least before Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles. Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning. Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century, Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Georgian architecture is characterized by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its proportion and balance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Regularity of housefronts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was considered a deep flaw of Georgian architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lack of symmetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decorative vocabulary did Georgian designs draw from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ancient Rome or Greece</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Versions of revived Palladian architecture dominated English country house architecture. Houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings, and large houses were generally made wide and relatively shallow, largely to look more impressive from a distance. The height was usually highest in the centre, and the Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally avoided. In grand houses, an entrance hall led to steps up to a piano nobile or mezzanine floor where the main reception rooms were. Typically the basement area or &quot;rustic&quot;, with kitchens, offices and service areas, as well as male guests with muddy boots, came some way above ground, and was lit by windows that were high on the inside, but just above ground level outside. A single block was typical, with a perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings and a gate, but rarely a stone gatehouse, or side wings around the court.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What revived style dominated English country house architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palladian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was done to make houses look more impressive from a distance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">made wide and relatively shallow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the height generally highest in Palladian architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the centre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were areas such as kitchens, offices, and service areas generally found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">basement area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What floor were the main receptions rooms generally located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mezzanine floor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Windows in all types of buildings were large and regularly placed on a grid; this was partly to minimize window tax, which was in force throughout the period in the United Kingdom. Some windows were subsequently bricked-in. Their height increasingly varied between the floors, and they increasingly began below waist-height in the main rooms, making a small balcony desirable. Before this the internal plan and function of the rooms can generally not be deduced from the outside. To open these large windows the sash window, already developed by the 1670s, became very widespread.

The roof was typically invisible from the ground, though domes were sometimes visible in grander buildings. The roofline was generally clear of ornament except for a balustrade or the top of a pediment.

This meant that the ground floor front was now removed and protected from the street and encouraged the main reception rooms to move there from the floor above.

In the period in question, only in Edinburgh were working-class purpose-built tenements common, though lodgers were common in other cities. A curving crescent, often looking out at gardens or a park, was popular for terraces where space allowed.

There had been occasional examples in town centres going back to medieval times. Most early suburban examples are large, and in what are now the outer fringes of Central London, but were then in areas being built up for the first time. Blackheath, Chalk Farm and St John's Wood are among the areas contesting being the original home of the semi. Sir John Summerson gave primacy to the Eyre Estate of St John's Wood. A plan for this exists dated 1794, where &quot;the whole development consists of pairs of semi-detached houses, So far as I know, this is the first recorded scheme of the kind&quot;. In fact the French Wars put an end to this scheme, but when the development was finally built it retained the semi-detached form, &quot;a revolution of striking significance and far-reaching effect&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cities contest to being the original home of the semi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blackheath, Chalk Farm and St John's Wood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A plan for a semi-detached houses was dated for what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1794</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who conferred primacy to the Eyre Estate of St John's Wood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Summerson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What put an end to the scheme of semi-detached houses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French Wars</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Until the Church Building Act of 1818, the period saw relatively few churches built in Britain, which was already well-supplied, although in the later years of the period the demand for Non-conformist and Roman Catholic places of worship greatly increased. Anglican churches that were built were designed internally to allow maximum audibility, and visibility, for preaching, so the main nave was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans, and often there were no side-aisles. Galleries were common in new churches. Especially in country parishes, the external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a Gothic church, with a tower or spire, a large west front with one or more doors, and very large windows along the nave, but all with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary. Where funds permitted, a classical temple portico with columns and a pediment might be used at the west front. Decoration inside was very limited, but churches filled up with monuments to the prosperous.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What act spurred to building of new churches in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Church Building Act of 1818</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Anglican churches internally designed for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">maximum audibility, and visibility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The later years of the period saw the demand for which places of worship increase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Non-conformist and Roman Catholic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were common in new churches?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Galleries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Churches filled up with monuments to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monuments to the prosperous</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Public buildings generally varied between the extremes of plain boxes with grid windows and Italian Late Renaissance palaces, depending on budget. Somerset House in London, designed by Sir William Chambers in 1776 for government offices, was as magnificent as any country house, though never quite finished, as funds ran out. Barracks and other less prestigious buildings could be as functional as the mills and factories that were growing increasingly large by the end of the period. But as the period came to an end many commercial projects were becoming sufficiently large, and well-funded, to become &quot;architectural in intention&quot;, rather than having their design left to the lesser class of &quot;surveyors&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Somerset House was designed by whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir William Chambers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Somerset House designed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1776</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Commercial projects in the late period tended to be &quot;architectural&quot; in what way?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;architectural in intention&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was considered a lesser class of designers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">surveyors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Georgian architecture was widely disseminated in the English colonies during the Georgian era.
