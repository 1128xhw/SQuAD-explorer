While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early analytic philosophy. The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether or not time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which philosophy branch is concerned with issues surrounding ontology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philosophy of space and time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The philosophy of space and time was inspired by what kind of philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early analytic philosophy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The  philosophy of space and time focuses on whether or not time and space exist independently of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mind</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The  philosophy of space and time focuses what kind of flow within time? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unidirectional</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The earliest recorded Western philosophy of time was expounded by the ancient Egyptian thinker Ptahhotep (c. 2650–2600 BC), who said, &quot;Do not lessen the time of following desire, for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit.&quot; The Vedas, the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy, dating back to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.

He describes time as an a priori notion that, together with other a priori notions such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant denies that either space or time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events.

The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise.

However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the luminiferous ether.

The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the wavelength of cadmium to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another.

This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects.

According to this theory, then, Homer really does exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time—just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words near, far, above, below, and such are directly comparable to phrases such as in the past, a minute ago, and so on).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to what theory is time an ordering of various realities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Presentism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Presentism states that at a certain time some things do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believes that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eternalist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to an Eternalist, what can be said to be just as real as things in the present?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all things—past, present, and future</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to the Eternalist theory, what must we use to describe Homer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">special language</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar.

Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists have attacked this position.

In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can asymmetry of causation be observed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in a non-arbitrary way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many features of asymmetry in the cup example can be viewed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Asymmetry is attributable to a relation of what kind of direction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">temporal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else, besides direction, is asymmetry attributable to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">implications of form and functional capacity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
