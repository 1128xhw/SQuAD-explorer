From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the cup called now?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cup Winners' Cup</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does the loser of the cup gain anything?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the losing FA Cup finalist was given the Europa League place</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did that used to have a different name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formerly named the UEFA Cup; until 1998</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what about the FA Cup winner?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do the FA Cup winners qualify for anything?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since 2008, one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007).

In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel. The top three most used venues in this period were Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times), Hillsborough in Sheffield (34 times) and Old Trafford in Manchester (23 times). The original Wembley Stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the semi finals played?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">e semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is there a name for the specific venue? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kennington Oval was used as the semi-final venue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the semi finals take place before then? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the top most used venue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the cup held in 2005?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2003 the FA took the decision to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.

In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out.

Only two other actual non-League clubs have even reached the final since the founding of the League: Sheffield Wednesday in 1890 (champions of the Football Alliance, a rival league which was already effectively the Second Division, which it formally became in 1892 – Wednesday being let straight into the First Division), and Southampton in 1900 and 1902 (in which years they were also Southern League champions, proving the strength of that league: again, they were probably of equivalent standard to a First Division club at the time, but Southampton's form subsequently faded and they did not join the League till 1920 and the formation of the Third Division.)</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the football league founded? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Football League was founded in 1888</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the only non league giant killer to win a cup?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tottenham Hotspur is the only non-league &quot;giant-killer&quot; to win the Cup</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did they win the cup? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1901</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did they delete for the cup? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sheffield United</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many clubs where in the football league? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">36 clubs in the Football League</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chasetown, whilst playing at Level 8 of English football during the 2007–08 competition, are the lowest-ranked team to play in the Third Round Proper (final 64, of 731 teams entered that season).

The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926 between Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester, the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff in 1927. The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full. The following season's final between Preston and Huddersfield was covered in full by the BBC. When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television, during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9 a.m. which was six hours before kick off. Nowadays, this continues with Setanta and ESPN having all-day broadcasts from Wembley, but terrestrial TV coverage usually begins two hours before kick off. The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988, when ITV lost coverage to the new Sports Channel which later became Sky Sports.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who used to brodcast the matches on the radio? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the BBC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first Fa cup radio broadcast? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What clubs competed in the match? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Wa the game broadcast in both cities? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">this was only broadcast in Manchester</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">So when was the firs national broadcast? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff in 1927</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From 1988 to 1997, the BBC and Sky Sports had coverage of the FA Cup, the BBC had highlights on Match of the Day and usually one match per round while Sky had the same deal. From 1997 to 2001, ITV and Sky shared live coverage with both having two matches per round and BBC continuing with highlights on Match of the Day. From 2002 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. From 2008–09 to 2013–14, FA Cup matches are shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland but STV refusing to show them. ITV shows 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final is also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, Setanta Sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches exclusively to Scotland, after the ITV franchise holder in Scotland, STV, decided not to broadcast FA Cup games. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals. As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009–10 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. ESPN bought the competition for the 2010–11 to 2012–13 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had FA cup coverage from 1988-1997?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">From 1988 to 1997, the BBC and Sky Sports had coverage of the FA Cup</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are the games broadcast now? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">, FA Cup matches are shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does anyone refuse to show them? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">STV refusing to show them</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Has a woman ever broadcast a match? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did rebecca host the match? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">for the 2010–11 to 2012–13 season</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many[who?] expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009–10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final.
