In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean &quot;those who serve in close attendance to the nobility&quot;, the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai.

One of the most important was that of the Taika Reform, issued by Prince Naka no Ōe (Emperor Tenji) in 646 AD. This edict allowed the Japanese aristocracy to adopt the Tang dynasty political structure, bureaucracy, culture, religion, and philosophy. As part of the Taihō Code, of 702 AD, and the later Yōrō Code, the population was required to report regularly for census, a precursor for national conscription. With an understanding of how the population was distributed, Emperor Mommu introduced a law whereby 1 in 3–4 adult males was drafted into the national military. These soldiers were required to supply their own weapons, and in return were exempted from duties and taxes. This was one of the first attempts by the Imperial government to form an organized army modeled after the Chinese system. It was called &quot;Gundan-Sei&quot; (軍団制) by later historians and is believed to have been short-lived.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Battle of Hakusukinoe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">663 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Battle of Hakusukinoe against?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tang China and Silla</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the effect of the Battle of Hakusukinoe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Japanese retreat from Korean affairs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Taika Reform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Naka no Ōe (Emperor Tenji)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Taika Reform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">646 AD</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early Heian period, the late 8th and early 9th centuries, Emperor Kammu sought to consolidate and expand his rule in northern Honshū, but the armies he sent to conquer the rebellious Emishi people lacked motivation and discipline, and failed in their task.[citation needed] Emperor Kammu introduced the title of sei'i-taishōgun (征夷大将軍) or Shogun, and began to rely on the powerful regional clans to conquer the Emishi.

Though originally sent to provincial areas for a fixed four-year term as a magistrate, the toryo declined to return to the capital when their terms ended, and their sons inherited their positions and continued to lead the clans in putting down rebellions throughout Japan during the middle- and later-Heian period. Because of their rising military and economic power, the warriors ultimately became a new force in the politics of the court. Their involvement in the Hōgen in the late Heian period consolidated their power, and finally pitted the rival Minamoto and Taira clans against each other in the Heiji Rebellion of 1160.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rebellion happened in 1160?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heiji Rebellion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who fought in the Heiji Rebellion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the rival Minamoto and Taira clans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long were the toryos' terms supposed to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four-year</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What clans were most regional clans' chiefs also a member of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fujiwara, Minamoto, or Taira clans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The winner, Taira no Kiyomori, became an imperial advisor, and was the first warrior to attain such a position.

(See Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea, Chōsen-seibatsu (朝鮮征伐?). Taking advantage of arquebus mastery and extensive wartime experience from the Sengoku period, Japanese samurai armies made major gains in most of Korea. Kato Kiyomasa advanced to Orangkai territory (present-day Manchuria) bordering Korea to the northeast and crossed the border into Manchuria, but withdrew after retaliatory attacks from the Jurchens there, as it was clear he had outpaced the rest of the Japanese invasion force. A few of the more famous samurai generals of this war were Katō Kiyomasa, Konishi Yukinaga, and Shimazu Yoshihiro. Shimazu Yoshihiro led some 7,000 samurai and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated a host of allied Ming and Korean forces at the Battle of Sacheon in 1598, near the conclusion of the campaigns. Yoshihiro was feared as Oni-Shimazu (&quot;Shimazu ogre&quot;) and his nickname spread across not only Korea but to Ming Dynasty China. In spite of the superiority of Japanese land forces, ultimately the two expeditions failed (though they did devastate the Korean landmass) from factors such as Korean naval superiority (which, led by Admiral Yi Sun-shin, harassed Japanese supply lines continuously throughout the wars, resulting in supply shortages on land), the commitment of sizeable Ming forces to Korea, Korean guerrilla actions, the underestimation of resistance by Japanese commanders (in the first campaign of 1592, Korean defenses on land were caught unprepared, under-trained, and under-armed; they were rapidly overrun, with only a limited number of successfully resistant engagements against the more-experienced and battle-hardened Japanese forces - in the second campaign of 1597, Korean and Ming forces proved to be a far more difficult challenge and, with the support of continued Korean naval superiority, limited Japanese gains to parts southeastern Korea), and wavering Japanese commitment to the campaigns as the wars dragged on. The final death blow to the Japanese campaigns in Korea came with Hideyoshi's death in late 1598 and the recall of all Japanese forces in Korea by the Council of Five Elders (established by Hideyoshi to oversee the transition from his regency to that of his son Hideyori).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Toyotomi Hideyoshi first send an army to Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1592</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Toyotomi Hideyoshi send an army to Korea a second time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1597</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did Toyotomi Hideyoshi send to Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">160,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Battle of Sacheon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1598</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Toyotomi Hideyoshi die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1598</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It should be noted that many samurai forces that were active throughout this period were not deployed to Korea; most importantly, the daimyo Tokugawa Ieyasu carefully kept forces under his command out of the Korean campaigns, and other samurai commanders who were opposed to Hideyoshi's domination of Japan either mulled Hideyoshi's call to invade Korea or contributed a small token force.

By the end of the Tokugawa era, samurai were aristocratic bureaucrats for the daimyo, with their daisho, the paired long and short swords of the samurai (cf. katana and wakizashi) becoming more of a symbolic emblem of power rather than a weapon used in daily life. They still had the legal right to cut down any commoner who did not show proper respect kiri-sute gomen (斬り捨て御免?), but to what extent this right was used is unknown. When the central government forced daimyos to cut the size of their armies, unemployed rōnin became a social problem.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were samurai becoming less warrior-like?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">During the Tokugawa shogunate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When had samurai last been used in battle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the early 17th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was another name for the Tokugawa era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Edo period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the samurai's long sword called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">katana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the samurai's short sword called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wakizashi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Theoretical obligations between a samurai and his lord (usually a daimyo) increased from the Genpei era to the Edo era.

Samurai became Shizoku (士族) who retained some of their salaries, but the right to wear a katana in public was eventually abolished along with the right to execute commoners who paid them disrespect. The samurai finally came to an end after hundreds of years of enjoyment of their status, their powers, and their ability to shape the government of Japan. However, the rule of the state by the military class was not yet over. In defining how a modern Japan should be, members of the Meiji government decided to follow the footsteps of the United Kingdom and Germany, basing the country on the concept of noblesse oblige. Samurai were not a political force under the new order. With the Meiji reforms in the late 19th century, the samurai class was abolished, and a western-style national army was established. The Imperial Japanese Armies were conscripted, but many samurai volunteered as soldiers, and many advanced to be trained as officers.

The culture associated with the samurai such as the tea ceremony, monochrome ink painting, rock gardens and poetry were adopted by warrior patrons throughout the centuries 1200–1600. These practices were adapted from the Chinese arts. Zen monks introduced them to Japan and they were allowed to flourish due to the interest of powerful warrior elites. Musō Soseki (1275–1351) was a Zen monk who was advisor to both Emperor Go-Daigo and General Ashikaga Takauji (1304–58). Musō, as well as other monks, acted as political and cultural diplomat between Japan and China. Musō was particularly well known for his garden design. Another Ashikaga patron of the arts was Yoshimasa. His cultural advisor, the Zen monk Zeami, introduced tea ceremony to him.

Nene, wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her husband's decisions at times and Yodo-dono, his concubine, became the de facto master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death. Tachibana Ginchiyo was chosen to lead the Tachibana clan after her father's death. Chiyo, wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo, has long been considered the ideal samurai wife. According to legend, she made her kimono out of a quilted patchwork of bits of old cloth and saved pennies to buy her husband a magnificent horse, on which he rode to many victories. The fact that Chiyo (though she is better known as &quot;Wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo&quot;) is held in such high esteem for her economic sense is illuminating in the light of the fact that she never produced an heir and the Yamauchi clan was succeeded by Kazutoyo's younger brother.

In Japanese, it was originally recorded in the Nara Period as a verb *samorapu (&quot;to watch, to keep watch, to observe, to be on the lookout for something; to serve, to attend&quot;), which is believed to be derived from the frequentative form (*morapu 守らふ) of the verb moru (守る, &quot;to watch, to guard, to be on the lookout; to keep, to protect, to take care of, to be in charge of, to have as one's ward&quot;). By the Heian period, this word had developed into the verb saburahu (さぶらふ, &quot;to serve, to attend&quot;), from which a deverbal noun saburahi (さぶらひ, &quot;servant, attendant&quot;) was later derived, and this noun then yielded samurahi (さむらひ) in the Edo period. In Japanese literature, there is an early reference to samurai in the Kokinshū (古今集, early 10th century):</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did 'samurai' mean at first?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those who serve in close attendance to nobility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did 'samorapu' mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to watch, to keep watch, to observe, to be on the lookout for something; to serve, to attend</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did 'saburahu' mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to serve, to attend</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did 'saburahi' mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">servant, attendant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the word 'samurahi' used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Edo period</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bushi was the name given to the ancient Japanese soldiers from traditional warrior families.

Samurai was a word used by the Kuge aristocratic class with warriors themselves preferring the word bushi.

Samurai were usually loyal to their immediate superiors, who in turn allied themselves with higher lords. These loyalties to the higher lords often shifted; for example, the high lords allied under Toyotomi Hideyoshi (豊臣秀吉) were served by loyal samurai, but the feudal lords under them could shift their support to Tokugawa, taking their samurai with them. There were, however, also notable instances where samurai would be disloyal to their lord or daimyo, when loyalty to the Emperor was seen to have supremacy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was an example of a disloyal samurai?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Akechi Mitsuhide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was an example of an excessively loyal samurai?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kusunoki Masashige)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some feudal lords shifted loyalties from Toyotomi to whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tokugawa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sometimes overrode samurais' loyalty to the daimyo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">loyalty to the Emperor was seen to have supremacy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jidaigeki (literally historical drama) has always been a staple program on Japanese movies and television. The programs typically feature a samurai. Samurai films and westerns share a number of similarities and the two have influenced each other over the years. One of Japan’s most renowned directors, Akira Kurosawa, greatly influenced the samurai aspect in western film-making.[citation needed] George Lucas’ Star Wars series incorporated many aspects from the Seven Samurai film. One example is that in the Japanese film, seven samurai warriors are hired by local farmers to protect their land from being overrun by bandits; In George Lucas’ Star Wars: A New Hope, a similar situation arises. Kurosawa was inspired by the works of director John Ford and in turn Kurosawa's works have been remade into westerns such as The Seven Samurai into The Magnificent Seven and Yojimbo into A Fistful of Dollars. There is also a 26 episode anime adaptation (Samurai 7) of The Seven Samurai.

Samurai-like characters are not just restricted to historical settings and a number of works set in the modern age, and even the future, include characters who live, train and fight like samurai.

The series was produced for American viewers which “embodies the trend... comparing hip-hop artists to samurai warriors, an image some rappers claim for themselves (Solomon, 2009).

Not only does the Silver Samurai make over 350 comic book appearances, the character is playable in several video games, such as Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, the samurai villain was depicted in James Mangold’s film The Wolverine. Ten years before the Wolverine debuted, another film helped pave the way to ensure the samurai were made known to American cinema: A film released in 2003 titled The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, is inspired by the samurai way of life. In the film, Cruise’s character finds himself deeply immersed in samurai culture. The character in the film, “Nathan Algren, is a fictional contrivance to make nineteenth-century Japanese history less foreign to American viewers”.(Ravina, 2010) After being captured by a group of samurai rebels, he becomes empathetic towards the cause they fight for. Taking place during the Meiji Period, Tom Cruise plays the role of US Army Captain Nathan Algren, who travels to Japan to train a rookie army in fighting off samurai rebel groups. Becoming a product of his environment, Algren joins the samurai clan in an attempt to rescue a captured samurai leader. “By the end of the film, he has clearly taken on many of the samurai traits, such as zen-like mastery of the sword, and a budding understanding of spirituality”.
