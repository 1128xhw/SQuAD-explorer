The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century, and the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914. The British set up administrative and legal structures whilst practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms. Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960, and plunged into a civil war from 1967 to 1970. It has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships, until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999, with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be conducted reasonably freely and fairly.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Southern and Northern Nigeria Protectorates merge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which empire ruled Nigeria as a colony?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Nigeria become independent from Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did a Nigerian Civil War begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1967</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Nigeria have a fair presidential election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nigeria is often referred to as the &quot;Giant of Africa&quot;, owing to its large population and economy.

The country is viewed as a multinational state, as it is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups, of which the three largest are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba; these ethnic groups speak over 500 different languages, and are identified with wide variety of cultures. The official language is English. Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Christians, who live mostly in the southern part of the country, and Muslims in the northern part.

Cities in the area became regional centres in a broad network of trade routes that spanned western, central and northern Africa. In the 16th century, Spanish and Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria, at the port they named Lagos and in Calabar. Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade. The port of Calabar on the historical Bight of Biafra (now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny) become one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade. Other major slaving ports in Nigeria were located in Badagry, Lagos on the Bight of Benin and on Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra. The majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports were captured in raids and wars. Usually the captives were taken back to the conquerors' territory as forced labour; after time, they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors' society. A number of slave routes were established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports. Some of the more prolific slave traders were linked with the Oyo Empire in the southwest, the Aro Confederacy in the southeast and the Sokoto Caliphate in the north.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What region has Nigeria traded with for centuries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries' explorers were the first Europeans to trade with Nigeria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spanish and Portuguese</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Calabar is on which historical Bight?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Biafra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the current name of the Bight of Biafra?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bight of Bonny</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the major slave traders through Nigeria from the southwest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oyo Empire</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The slave trade was engaged in by European state and non-state actors such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal and private companies, as well as various African states and non-state actors. With rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities, Great Britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain established the West Africa Squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves. It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye, and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the Lagos Treaty of Cession. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland. In 1864, Samuel Ajayi Crowther became the first African bishop of the Anglican Church.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Britain outlaw slave trade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1807</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After which war did Britain establish its West Africa Squadron?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Napoleonic Wars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Lagos king had supported the slave trade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oba Kosoko</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Britain intervene in a power struggle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lagos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Britain take slaves it seized from traders?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Freetown</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1885, British claims to a West African sphere of influence received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company under the leadership of Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered Benin in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Britain's claim to West Africa recognized in 1885?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Berlin Conference</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company was led by Sir George Taubman Goldie?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Niger Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the British government take over the Royal Niger Company's territory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1900</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Nigeria become a British protectorate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1 January 1901</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country did Britain conquer in 1897?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Christian missions established Western educational institutions in the Protectorates.

Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present-day. Imbalances between North and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well.

Despite huge revenues from oil production and sale, the military administration did little to improve the standard of living of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fuelled the rise of federal subventions to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country.

These scams involve a complicit Nigerian bank (the laws being set up loosely to allow it) and a scammer who claims to have money he needs to obtain from that bank. The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to him, and then he'll get to keep a cut. In reality, money is taken out instead, and/or large fees (which seem small in comparison with the imaginary wealth he awaits) are deducted.

Jonathan however dismissed the claim and replaced Sanusi for his mismanagement of the central bank's budget. A Senate committee also found Sanusi’s account to be lacking substance. After the conclusion of the NNPC's account Audit, it was announced in January 2015 that NNPC's non-remitted revenue is actually US$1.48billion, which it needs to refund back to the Government.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2011 rankings, how bad was Nigeria's corruption ranking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">143 out of 182 countries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2014 rankings, how bad was Nigeria's corruption ranking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">136th position</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was embezzled from the Nigerian government in 1960-1999?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">More than $400 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The state oil company NNPC was initially thought to owe how much to the government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$20 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In a corrected audit, the state oil company NNPC was found to only owe how much to the government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$1.48billion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Nigerian film industry is known as Nollywood (a portmanteau of Nigeria and Hollywood) and is now the 2nd-largest producer of movies in the world.
