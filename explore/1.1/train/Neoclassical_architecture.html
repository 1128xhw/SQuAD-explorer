The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boullée's ideas and Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to &quot;architecture parlante&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who influenced many 19th century neoclassical architects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicolas Ledoux</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do geometric architecture emulate of the universe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eternality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Edmund Burke concept is linked to Boullee's ideas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sublime</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concept did Ledoux address?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">architectural character</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As a concept of neoclassical architecture, what should be immediately communicated to viewer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">building should immediately communicate its function</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The baroque style had never truly been to the English taste.

The most popular was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. The book contained architectural prints of famous British buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio. At first the book mainly featured the work of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects.

In 1734 William Kent and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with Holkham Hall in Norfolk.

Stuart was commissioned after his return from Greece by George Lyttelton to produce the first Greek building in England, the garden temple at Hagley Hall (1758–59).

It was to be William Wilkins's winning design for the public competition for Downing College, Cambridge that announced the Greek style was to be the dominant idiom in architecture. Wilkins and Robert Smirke went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era, including the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (1808–09), the General Post Office (1824–29) and the British Museum (1823–48), Wilkins University College London (1826–30) and the National Gallery (1832–38). In Scotland, Thomas Hamilton (1784–1858), in collaboration with the artists Andrew Wilson (1780–1848) and Hugh William Williams (1773–1829) created monuments and buildings of international significance; the Burns Monument at Alloway (1818) and the (Royal) High School in Edinburgh (1823–29).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose winning design for public competition began the dominance of Greek style architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Wilkins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What monument was created in 1818?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burns Monument at Alloway</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the General Post Office built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1824–29</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the British Museum built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1823–48</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the National Gallery constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1832–38</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the same time the Empire style in France was a more grandiose wave of neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts.

The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States, the Regency style in Britain, and the Napoleonstil in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour &quot;so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How would the Empire style of France be characterized by comparison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more grandiose</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the origination of the Imperial Roman Style?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Napoleon I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the corresponding style to Empire in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Regency</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the US, the style during this time of Neoclassical Empire was known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federal style</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>High neoclassicism was an international movement.

A combination of simple forms and high levels of enrichment was adopted by the majority of contemporary British architects and designers.

In Scotland and the north of England, where the Gothic Revival was less strong, architects continued to develop the neoclassical style of William Henry Playfair. The works of Cuthbert Brodrick and Alexander Thomson show that by the end of the 19th century the results could be powerful and eccentric.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What author's 20th century writing caused interest in pure neoclassical design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albert Richardson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what period did Percy Thomas design public building in neoclassical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">interwar period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sir Edwin Lutyens' city planning in what city marked a shift in design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Delhi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new design was trending after neoclassical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gothic Revival</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first phase of neoclassicism in France is expressed in the &quot;Louis XVI style&quot; of architects like Ange-Jacques Gabriel (Petit Trianon, 1762–68); the second phase, in the styles called Directoire and &quot;Empire&quot;, might be characterized by Jean Chalgrin's severe astylar Arc de Triomphe (designed in 1806). In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam, the second by those of Sir John Soane. The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style, the &quot;Goût grec&quot; (&quot;Greek style&quot;) not a court style. Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, bring the &quot;Louis XVI&quot; style to court.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the first wave of neoclassicism in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Louis XVI style</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">France's second phase of neoclassic is known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Directoire and &quot;Empire&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What architect typifies the first style of neoclassical in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Adam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Structure of whom characterize England's second phase of neoclassical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir John Soane</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who styled the court in France for more modern design after 1771?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marie Antoinette</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>What little there was, started with Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773–80), and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's Barriere des Bonshommes (1785–89).

Also the work of a French architect Charles Moreau is the garden façade of the Esterházy Palace (1797–1805) in Kismarton (today Eisenstadt in Austria). The two principal architect of Neoclassicism in Hungary was Mihály Pollack and József Hild. Pollack's major work is the Hungarian National Museum (1837–1844).

Early examples include the Bibliotheca (1786), the De Rohan Arch (1798) and the Hompesch Gate (1801). However, neoclassical architecture only became popular in Malta following the establishment of British rule in the early 19th century. In 1814, a neoclassical portico decorated with the British coat of arms was added to the Main Guard building so as to serve as a symbol of British Malta. Other 19th century neoclassical buildings include RNH Bighi (1832), St Paul's Pro-Cathedral (1844), the Rotunda of Mosta (1860) and the now destroyed Royal Opera House (1866).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Malta introduced to neoclassical architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the ruler at the time of neoclassical introduction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hospitaller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was RNH Bighi built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1832</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the St Paul's Pro-Cathedral get built? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1844</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term Traditional Architecture (or vernacular) is mostly used.

This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the lull in neoclassical architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the movement that caused resurgence of neoclassicism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Urbanism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many post modern designs feature classic elements in what way?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ironic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What recent architect began to take elements of classicism seriously?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Gordon Smith</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Britain a number of architects are active in the neoclassical style. Two new university Libraries, Quinlan Terry's Maitland Robinson Library at Downing College and ADAM Architecture's Sackler Library illustrate that the approach taken can range from the traditional, in the former case, to the unconventional, in the latter case. Recently, Prince Charles came under controversy for promoting a classically designed development on the land of the former Chelsea Barracks in London. Writing to the Qatari Royal family (who were funding the development through the property development company Qatari Diar) he condemned the accepted modernist plans, instead advocating a classical approach. His appeal was met with success and the plans were withdrawn. A new design by architecture house Dixon Jones is currently being drafted.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who has stirred controversy for development and design of Chelsea Barracks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Charles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What family was funding the development of former Chelsea Barracks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qatari Royal family</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new library illustrates the traditional style of neoclassicism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quinlan Terry's Maitland Robinson Library at Downing College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the library that illustrates the unconventional style of neoclassical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ADAM Architecture's Sackler Library</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is neoclassical design current in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a number of architects are active in the neoclassical</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
