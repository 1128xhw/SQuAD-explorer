In the 16th century some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were of Roman extraction, and the Lithuanian language was just a morphed Latin language. This led to paradox: Polish nobility claimed own ancestry from Sarmatian tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies to Romans. Thus new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led that in the 16th century the new term to name Lithuanian nobility appeared šlėkta—a direct loanword from Polish szlachta. From the view of historical truth Lithuanians also should use this term, šlėkta (szlachta), to name own nobility, but Lithuanian linguists forbade the usage of this Polish loanword. This refusal to use word szlachta (in Lithuanian text šlėkta) complicates all naming.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other group had equal status with the lithuanian nobility?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polish szlachta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the polish szlachta become more of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polonized</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did some lithuanian nobility claim that caused a paradox?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they were of Roman extraction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the new term used for the lithuanian nobility?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">šlėkta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who forbid the use of the word slekta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lithuanian linguists</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The process of polonization took place over a lengthy period of time.

Hundreds of such false nobles were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his Liber generationis plebeanorium (or Liber chamorum) in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles from owning nobility-estates and promised the estate to the denouncer. Trepka was an impoverished nobleman who lived a townsman life and collected hundreds of such stories hoping to take over any of such estates.

This state of affairs grew up in part because of the extinction of the male-line descendants of the old royal dynasty (first the Piasts, then the Jagiellons), and the selection by the nobility of the Polish king from among the dynasty's female-line descendants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">THe polish nobility had many positives compared to others including what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">many rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the nobilities commonwealth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Poland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">WHo elected the king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not of the king or the ruling dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">WHy did the state affairs partly grow up on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the extinction of the male-line descendants of the old royal dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The selection of nobility oh the polish kingdom was selected my whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dynasty's female-line descendants.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Poland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility at the time of their election to the throne (the privileges being specified in the king-elect's Pacta conventa) and at other times in exchange for ad hoc permission to raise an extraordinary tax or a pospolite ruszenie.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did kings grant privileges to the nobles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at the time of their election to the throne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What specified the kings privileges?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">king-elect's Pacta conventa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was also in exchange during he election of the throne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ad hoc permission to raise an extraordinary tax</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did nobles get in from the king during election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">privileges</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1355 in Buda King Casimir III the Great issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreement that in the lack of Casimir's male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, Louis I of Hungary.

In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was abolished; no new taxes could be raised without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, also, district offices (Polish: &quot;urzędy ziemskie&quot;) were reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights.

It was deliberately enacted in a way that would ruin the szlachta. It was the only area where peasants paid the market price in redemption for the land (the average for the empire was 34% above the market price). All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned without redemption payments. The ex serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 were in the 8 western provinces. Along with Romania, Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished. All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863. By 1864 80% of szlachta were déclassé, 1/4 petty nobles were worse off than the average serf, 48.9% of land in Russian Poland was in peasant hands, nobles still held 46%.

Although Jewish religion wasn't usually a pretext to block or deprive of noble status, some laws favoured religious conversion from Judaism to Christianity (see: Neophyte) by rewarding it with ennoblement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two religions were most common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Catholic or Orthodox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the minority group in the polish nobility?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muslims</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was rewarding for switching judiasm to christianity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ennoblement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened after the roman catholic church regained power in Poland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the smallest amount of religion in the noble?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jews</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
