The formation of a united ministry of defence was rejected by David Lloyd George's coalition government in 1921; but the Chiefs of Staff Committee was formed in 1923, for the purposes of inter-Service co-ordination. As rearmament became a concern during the 1930s, Stanley Baldwin created the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence. Lord Chatfield held the post until the fall of Neville Chamberlain's government in 1940; his success was limited by his lack of control over the existing Service departments and his limited political influence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What three services make up the armed forces of the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the British Army, the Royal Navy, and the Royal Air Force</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did David Lloyd George's coalition government reject in 1921?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The formation of a united ministry of defence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Chiefs of Staff Committee formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1923</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stanley Baldwin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What post did Lord Chatfield hold until 1940?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Minister for Coordination of Defence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Winston Churchill, on forming his government in 1940, created the office of Minister of Defence to exercise ministerial control over the Chiefs of Staff Committee and to co-ordinate defence matters.

The report also cites concerns over potential cuts in the defence science and technology research budget; implications of inappropriate estimation of Defence Inflation within budgetary processes; underfunding in the Equipment Programme; and a general concern over striking the appropriate balance over a short-term focus (Current Operations) and long-term consequences of failure to invest in the delivery of future UK defence capabilities on future combatants and campaigns. The then Secretary of State for Defence, Bob Ainsworth MP, reinforced this reprioritisation of focus on current operations and had not ruled out &quot;major shifts&quot; in defence spending. In the same article the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, Royal Navy, acknowledged that there was not enough money within the defence budget and it is preparing itself for tough decisions and the potential for cutbacks. According to figures published by the London Evening Standard the defence budget for 2009 is &quot;more than 10% overspent&quot; (figures cannot be verified) and the paper states that this had caused Gordon Brown to say that the defence spending must be cut.

The northern entrance in Horse Guards Avenue is flanked by two monumental statues, Earth and Water, by Charles Wheeler. Opposite stands the Gurkha Monument, sculpted by Philip Jackson and unveiled in 1997 by Queen Elizabeth II. Within it is the Victoria Cross and George Cross Memorial, and nearby are memorials to the Fleet Air Arm and RAF (to its east, facing the riverside).

Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where &quot;more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.&quot; Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results from these trials &quot;will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.&quot; Asked whether such tests are still being carried out, she said: &quot;It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.&quot; It is unknown whether or not the harmlessness of the trials was known at the time of their occurrence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What publication released a report about the Ministry of Defence in 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Guardian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the MoD accused of doing to the public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">secret germ warfare tests</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the children of some families in the area of the testing experiencing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the supposed germ warfare testing taking place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between 1940 and 1979</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were millions of people supposedly exposed to e. coli and an anthrax-like bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between 1961 and 1968</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The MoD has been criticised for an ongoing fiasco, having spent £240m on eight Chinook HC3 helicopters which only started to enter service in 2010, years after they were ordered in 1995 and delivered in 2001.
