The mainstream Hindu philosophy includes six systems (ṣaḍdarśana) – Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta. These are also called the Astika (orthodox) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as authoritative, important source of knowledge.[note 1][note 2] Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called nāstika (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies. Nāstika Indian philosophies include Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka, Ājīvika, and others.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the origin of Hindu philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ancient India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many main systems of Hindu philosophy are there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the main orthodox systems of Hindu philosophy called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Astika</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the accepted source of knowledge in the Astika system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vedas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the non-orthodox Indian philosophies that do not accept Vedas called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nāstika</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Scholars have debated the relationship and differences within āstika philosophies and with nāstika philosophies, starting with the writings of Indologists and Orientalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies.

Guna, it states, are of three types: Sattva being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; Rajas guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and Tamas being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three gunas, but in different proportions. The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life. Samkhya theorises a pluralism of souls (Jeevatmas) who possess consciousness, but denies the existence of Ishvara (God).

Mīmāṃsākas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as central purpose and noblest necessity of dharma and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end. The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that Mīmāṃsā school developed and emphasized karmakāṇḍa (that part of the śruti which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasized jñānakāṇḍa (that portion of the Vedas which relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what study did Mimamsa give rise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Mimamsa school think that language was meant to describe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">proper, correct and right</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What school thought that language was supposed to be widened to describe and develop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vedantins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What parts of the Vedas did the Mimamsa school emphasize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early parts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sections of the Vedas did the Verdanta school favor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">latter parts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Vedānta school built upon the teachings of the Upanishads and Brahma Sutras from the first millennium BCE and is the most developed and well-known of the Hindu schools.

The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient and medieval era Vedanta scholars.

Its first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar Adi Shankara, who continued the line of thought of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher's teacher Gaudapada.

The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore &quot;transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be&quot;. The concept of ātman is of soul, self within each person, each living being. Advaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence. They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to a school of Vedanta, what is all reality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brahman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concepts of metaphysics are included in Vedanta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">māyā and ātman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the reality of maya viewed in Vedanta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">always changing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what does the concept of atman refer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soul</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what do Advaita Vedantins view atman as the same?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brahman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ramanuja (c. 1037–1137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita or qualified non-dualism.

They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman.

Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed.

Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler. Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves.
