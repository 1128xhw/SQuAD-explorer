It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did To Kill a Mockingbird first get circulated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What prize did To Kill a Mockingbird win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pulitzer Prize</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harper Lee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the novel To Kill a Mockingbird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harper Lee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was To Kill a Mockingbird first published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whom did Lee base the characters in To Kill a Mockingbird on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her family and neighbors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the American Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To Kill a Mockingbird is widely read in which countries schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What genre of book is To Kill a Mockingbird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Southern Gothic novel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some of the central themes of the book are what exactly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">racial injustice and the destruction of innocence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which region of America was the novel set in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Deep South</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has caused  the use of the novel in classrooms to be challenged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">racial epithets</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication.

In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one &quot;every adult should read before they die&quot;. It was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote.

She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott , who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing. Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Harper Lee become childhood friends with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Truman Capote</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Harper Lee pack up to go live in New York City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What job did Harper Lee start in New York City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reservation clerk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which state did Harper Lee spend her childhood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alabama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Harper Lee born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1926</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the famous writer Lee became close friends with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Truman Capote</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Lee attend college?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Huntingdon College</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Lee attend law school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Alabama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What publishing company bought To Kill a Mockingbird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">J.

Hohoff was impressed. “[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line,” she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott. But as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird was named what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Go Set a Watchman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the editor who got their hands on the first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tay Hohoff</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of  the editor who helped Lee finish her book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Therese von Hohoff Torrey</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lee had lost her mother, who suffered from mental illness, six years before she met Hohoff at Lippincott’s offices.

The book was published on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the &quot;Watchman&quot; title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, &quot;I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.' ... I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.&quot; Instead of a &quot;quick and merciful death&quot;, Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.

It focuses on six-year-old Jean Louise Finch (Scout), who lives with her older brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified of, and fascinated by, their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and, for many years few have seen him. The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the setting for To Kill a Mockingbird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maycomb, Alabama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years does the story of To Kill a Mockingbird take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many children does the protagonist, Atticus Finch, have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Atticus Finch's children make friends with whom during the story?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dill</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the town the story takes place in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maycomb, Alabama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what historical era does the book take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Great Depression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the main character of the book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean Louise Finch (Scout)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell.

Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated, he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years. Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent. Lee had a brother named Edwin, who—like the fictional Jem—was four years older than his sister. As in the novel, a black housekeeper came daily to care for the Lee house and family.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Harper Lee has stated that To Kill a Mockingbird is not what genre of book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">autobiography</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Harper Lee's father represent two black men accused of murder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Harper Lee's mother die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What titles did Lee's father maintain at the local newspaper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">editor and publisher</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lee modeled the character of Dill on her childhood friend, Truman Capote, known then as Truman Persons. Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City. Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote were atypical children: both loved to read. Lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight, but Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old Underwood typewriter Lee's father gave them. They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them &quot;apart people&quot;. In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote's nonfiction novel In Cold Blood.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Truman Capote live in relation to Lee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">next door</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Lee and Capote go to Kansas together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Murders were the base for which story that Capote wrote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In Cold Blood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the character Dill modeled after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Truman Capote</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Lee and Capote write their childhood stories on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">old Underwood typewriter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term did Capote use to describe Lee and himself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">apart people</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937. Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys, in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served &quot;the same purpose&quot; to display Southern prejudices. Emmett Till, a black teenager who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, is also considered a model for Tom Robinson.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age was Lee when a white woman accused a black guy of rape?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the black man who was accused of rape in Lee's town when she was 10?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Walter Lett</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the black teenager that Tom Robinson was supposedly based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emmett Till</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Emmett Till's death sparked which political movement in the '50s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Civil Rights Movement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What purpose did Tom Robinson's trial serve in the book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">display Southern prejudices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who's death was a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emmett Till</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Writing about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: &quot;Laughter ... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly ... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at.&quot; Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspire National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her &quot;hysterically funny&quot;. To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two forms of humor are most found in To Kill a Mockingbird?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Satire and irony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Lee uses which writing styles to express humor in a tragic story?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parody, satire, and irony</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot.

The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel. Lee used the term &quot;Gothic&quot; to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism. However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What genre of book is To Kill a Mockingbird typically called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Southern Gothic and coming-of-age or Bildungsroman novel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term did Lee use to describe the town's courthouse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gothic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does Scout revere above everyone else?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atticus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them.

I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like&quot;. This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the neighbor that Jem speaks too after Tom Robinson's trial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miss Maudie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What des Jem struggle to understand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">separations of race and class</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed &quot;the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro&quot;. In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it &quot;reasonable to believe&quot; that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Montgomery Bus Boycott take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1955</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many reviewers consider the second part of the book to be about what issue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">race relations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the &quot;mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood&quot;. Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways. Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as &quot;stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him&quot;. Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, shot seventeen times.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The main jurors in Tom Robinson's trial were all which race?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">white</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Tom Robinson die in the novel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shot seventeen times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the time of the novel's setting, what punishment was often received by black males for percieved sexual contact with a white woman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">death</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who comprised Tom's jury?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poor white farmers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was Tom shot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seventeen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well.

He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes.

Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, &quot;in Austenian fashion&quot;, satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify.

Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community.

In a statement that foreshadows Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is &quot;when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mrs. Dubose suffers from an addiction to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">morphine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the moral center of the novel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atticus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The novel explores various forms of what trait?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">courage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Charles Shields, who has written the only book-length biography of Harper Lee to date, offers the reason for the novel's enduring popularity and impact is that &quot;its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal&quot;.

When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, &quot;Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are the main female role models for Scout during the story?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calpurnia and Miss Maudie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are Scout's two primary female models?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calpurnia and Miss Maudie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who chastis Scout for the way she dresse and accuses her of ruining her family name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mrs. Dubose</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tomboy Scout grows up tto become what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">feminist</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: &quot;It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the book, which character was expected of molesting their child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bob Ewell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the only non-abusive father mentioned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atticus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Allusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, has drawn the attention from legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that &quot;a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals&quot;. The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: &quot;Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.&quot; Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's &quot;fanatical&quot; attempts to place her in them made her feel &quot;a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]&quot;. Johnson states, &quot;[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which character is chastised in the book for marrying a black woman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dolphus Raymond</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does Charles Lamb speculate were once children?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lawyers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Scout's pink cotton penitentiary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">frilly clothes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel.

Atticus warns them that, although they can &quot;shoot all the bluejays they want&quot;, they must remember that &quot;it's a sin to kill a mockingbird&quot;. Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, &quot;They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.&quot; Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, &quot;'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson.&quot; Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which animal serves as a symbol throughout the book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Songbirds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Harper Lee's mother's maiden name was what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Finch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which bird does Atticus Finch say is a &quot;sin to kill?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mockingbird</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Atticus, which bird is it a sin to shoot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mockingbird</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Miss Maudie, which bird is never harmful?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mockingbird</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Symbolically, killing a mockingbird is killing what according to Edwin Bruell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that which is innocent and harmless</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite her editors' warnings that the book might not sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, in her hometown of Monroeville, and throughout Alabama.

Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb.

Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it &quot;inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion&quot; and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as &quot;an act of humanity&quot; in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War.

That film was a work of art.&quot; Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release, and Lee was so impressed with Peck's performance that she gave him her father's pocketwatch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for best actor. Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport. When Peck eventually did tell Lee, he said she responded, &quot;'Well, it's only a watch.' Harper—she feels deeply, but she's not a sentimental person about things.&quot; Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: &quot;They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.&quot; This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how &quot;Watchman&quot; was seen as just the first draft of &quot;Mockingbird&quot;. Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Go Set a Watchman introduced to the public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 14, 2015</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Go Set a Watchman was finished in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1957</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years after To Kill a Mockingbird is the setting of Go Set A Watchman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Harper Lee's lawyer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tonja Carter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the earlier draft of the book titled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Go Set a Watchman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Watchman completed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1957</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years after Mockingbird was Watchman set?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality.

Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, &quot;Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition.&quot; Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a &quot;delightfully deceptive&quot; story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding. Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Lee's strongest style of writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">narration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What narrative technique does Lee use to combine the adult's perspective with the child's observations??</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flashback</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Harper Lee has remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused: &quot;Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that To Kill a Mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Lee, her book simply expressed a Christian code of honor and conduct inherit to whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all Southerners</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of &quot;fine folks&quot; being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides the children's fascination with Boo, the first part of the book was concerned about their feelings for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the neighborhood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Lee's detailed explanations of the characters' behaviors caused one writer to catagorize the book as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Southern romantic regionalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Scout defined people doing the best they could with what they had as who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fine folks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What drives the plot of the book more than the characters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The South itself</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel.

In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and &quot;reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races&quot; while giving the &quot;appearance of gentility, piety, and morality&quot;.

Jane Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees, stating that the book &quot;still rouses fresh and horrified indignation&quot; as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with &quot;a fiercely progressive ink, in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question&quot;, comparing her to William Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability.

Thomas Mallon in The New Yorker criticizes Atticus' stiff and self-righteous demeanor, and calls Scout &quot;a kind of highly constructed doll&quot; whose speech and actions are improbable. Although acknowledging that the novel works, Mallon blasts Lee's &quot;wildly unstable&quot; narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama, following with his observation that &quot;the book has begun to cherish its own goodness&quot; by the time the case is over.[note 2] Defending the book, Akin Ajayi writes that justice &quot;is often complicated, but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all.&quot; Ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race, class, and society, but that it was not written to resolve them.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who criticized Lee in The Wall Street Journal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Allen Barra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote that the book forces readers to question issues without resolving them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Akin Ajayi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Furthermore, despite the novel's thematic focus on racial injustice, its black characters are not fully examined.

One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice &quot;functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to find our relative position in society&quot;.

McWhorter writes of Lee, &quot;for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest.&quot;[note 4] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: &quot;I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism ...
