However, since the early 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary and due to the economic fluctuations in Venezuela which also promoted an important migration of Venezuelan professionals to the US.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Venezuelans emigrate to the united states?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does Venezuela have immigrates from other countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Between the 18th and early 19th centuries, there were many European immigrants who went to Venezuela</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Venezuelans come to America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Many Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a better education, only to remain in there following graduation.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Do Venezuelans still come to America for the same reasons as they did before?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">since the early 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 2000s, more Venezuelans opposing the economic and political policies of president Hugo Chávez migrated to the United States (mostly to Florida, but New York City and Houston are other destinations).
