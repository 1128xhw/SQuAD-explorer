In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1988 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles.

The club was renamed again to Woolwich Arsenal after becoming a limited company in 1893. The club became the first southern member of the Football League in 1893, starting out in the Second Division, and won promotion to the First Division in 1904. The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall. Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, north London; they dropped &quot;Woolwich&quot; from their name the following year. Arsenal only finished in fifth place in the second division during the last pre-war competitive season of 1914–15, but were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division when competitive football resumed in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Some books have reported that this election to division 1 was achieved by dubious means.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group from the munitions plant in Woolwich formed the Arsenal club?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">workers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year had Arsenal become a limited company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1893</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Arsenal move to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1913</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which division was Arsenal ranked by the start of WWI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second division</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By 1920 where was Arsenal ranked in division?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">First Division</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Arsenal appointed Herbert Chapman as manager in 1925. Having already won the league twice with Huddersfield Town in 1923–24 and 1924–25 (see Seasons in English football), Chapman brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as Alex James and Cliff Bastin, laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s. Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies – victory in the 1930 FA Cup Final preceded two League Championships, in 1930–31 and 1932–33. In addition, Chapman was behind the 1932 renaming of the local London Underground station from &quot;Gillespie Road&quot; to &quot;Arsenal&quot;, making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a football club.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What manager was appointed to lead Arsenal in 1925?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Herbert Chapman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Chapman's style of tactics that provided the basis for the Arsenal club's success?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">revolutionary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade did Arsenal dominate in English football?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1930s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What football club manager got an underground station renamed for Arsenal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chapman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of Arsenal's first major wins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1930 FA Cup Final</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club physiotherapist Bertie Mee as manager in 1966.

Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997–98 and a third in 2001–02.

For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to copyright it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold &quot;unofficial&quot; Arsenal merchandise, Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable. The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a sans-serif typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Latin motto was added to the crest in 1949?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Victoria Concordia Crescit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1949 what new addition was done to enhance the Arsenal club crest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rendered in colour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What legal stance did Arsenal use to win a law suit against a merchant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trademark</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Arsenal produce a remodeled crest that could be copyrighted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Who did Arsenal supporters think should have been consulted before announcing the new crest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The monogram theme was developed into an Art Deco-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border.

Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.

Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.

Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%). In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89%.

On 10 March 2016, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £15,670, which sets the club's market capitalisation value at approximately £975m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $1.3 billion in 2015. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand.

The film centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager George Allison was given a speaking part. More recently, the book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball's Boston Red Sox.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what film was Arsenal FC shown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Arsenal Stadium Mystery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Arsenal manager had a speaking part in the 1939 film?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Allison</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book by Nick Hornby has twice been adapted for film?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fever Pitch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Hornby's book published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade did film and literature help revive football in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a defensive and &quot;boring&quot; side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s; many comedians, such as Eric Morecambe, made jokes about this at the team's expense.
