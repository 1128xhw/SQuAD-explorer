Dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is run.

Functional testing within OAT is limited to those tests which are required to verify the non-functional aspects of the system.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term used to test software during a pre-release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Operational Acceptance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Operational Acceptance focus on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">operational readiness of the system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Operational Acceptance limited to while testing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">limited to those tests which are required to verify the non-functional aspects of the system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A common cause of software failure (real or perceived) is a lack of its compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original (such as a terminal or GUI application intended to be run on the desktop now being required to become a web application, which must render in a web browser). For example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running. This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment was capable of using. Sometimes such issues can be fixed by proactively abstracting operating system functionality into a separate program module or library.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common reason for software failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">compatibility with other application software</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do developers commonly do when creating software that can lead to failures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lack of backward compatibility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common cause for software failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lack of its compatibility with other application software</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What often lacks in software developed when its released that can eventually lead to errors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a lack of backward compatibility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does backwards compatibility always seem to be the cause of errors and bugs after a release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">test software only on the latest version of the target environment</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Regression testing focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, as degraded or lost features, including old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly, stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test-cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk. Regression testing is typically the largest test effort in commercial software development, due to checking numerous details in prior software features, and even new software can be developed while using some old test-cases to test parts of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Finding defects once a change in code had already happened is called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Regression testing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens to software after a major change in code that leads to regression??</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stops working as intended</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a common method used during regression testing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">re-running previous sets of test-cases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What determines how deep a tester will go during regression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phase in the release process and the risk of the added features</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If changes need to occur during the softwares early release with regression testing how much of an impact does this have on the team as related to other testing? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">typically the largest test effort in commercial software development</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beta testing comes after alpha testing and can be considered a form of external user acceptance testing.

In this process, unit tests are written first, by the software engineers (often with pair programming in the extreme programming methodology). Of course these tests fail initially; as they are expected to. Then as code is written it passes incrementally larger portions of the test suites. The test suites are continuously updated as new failure conditions and corner cases are discovered, and they are integrated with any regression tests that are developed. Unit tests are maintained along with the rest of the software source code and generally integrated into the build process (with inherently interactive tests being relegated to a partially manual build acceptance process). The ultimate goal of this test process is to achieve continuous integration where software updates can be published to the public frequently.  </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two current movements adhere to the &quot;test-driven software development&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">extreme programming and the agile software development</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under the development of agile software and extreme programing what is written first?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unit tests are written first</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the goal of Unit testing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">achieve continuous integration where software updates can be published to the public frequently</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bottom Up Testing is an approach to integrated testing where the lowest level components (modules, procedures, and functions) are tested first, then integrated and used to facilitate the testing of higher level components.

The process is repeated until the components at the top of the hierarchy are tested.

For instance, testing when we assume that the behavior of the implementation under test can be denoted by a deterministic finite-state machine for some known finite sets of inputs and outputs and with some known number of states belongs to Class I (and all subsequent classes). However, if the number of states is not known, then it only belongs to all classes from Class II on. If the implementation under test must be a deterministic finite-state machine failing the specification for a single trace (and its continuations), and its number of states is unknown, then it only belongs to classes from Class III on. Testing temporal machines where transitions are triggered if inputs are produced within some real-bounded interval only belongs to classes from Class IV on, whereas testing many non-deterministic systems only belongs to Class V (but not all, and some even belong to Class I). The inclusion into Class I does not require the simplicity of the assumed computation model, as some testing cases involving implementations written in any programming language, and testing implementations defined as machines depending on continuous magnitudes, have been proved to be in Class I. Other elaborated cases, such as the testing framework by Matthew Hennessy under must semantics, and temporal machines with rational timeouts, belong to Class II.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If the number of states is unknown, what group does this fall into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Class II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">There are three classes, what has been concluded and proven for all classes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">each class is strictly included into the next</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If the number of states are unknown and the finite state of the machine is failing for a single trace, which group does this fall into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Class III</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Several certification programs exist to support the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists.
