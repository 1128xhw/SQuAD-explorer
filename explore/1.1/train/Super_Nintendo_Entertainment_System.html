In Japan, the system is called the Super Famicom (Japanese: スーパーファミコン, Hepburn: Sūpā Famikon?, officially adopting the abbreviated name of its predecessor, the Family Computer), or SFC for short. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy (슈퍼 컴보이 Syupeo Keomboi) and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. It was released in Brazil on September 2, 1992, by Playtronic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the SNES released in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the SNES first released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan and South Korea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the SNES called in Japan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Super Famicom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the SNES called in South Korea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Super Comboy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the SNES released in Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988.

Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.

Most of the PAL region versions of the console use the Japanese Super Famicom design, except for labeling and the length of the joypad leads. The Playtronic Super NES in Brazil, although PAL, uses the North American design. Both the NES and SNES were released in Brazil in 1993 by Playtronic, a joint venture between the toy company Estrela and consumer electronics company Gradiente.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the SNES cost in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US$199</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the SNES cost in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GB£150</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the SNES released in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the SNES released in Brazil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1993</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company distributed the SNES in Brazil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Playtronic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The rivalry between Nintendo and Sega resulted in what has been described as one of the most notable console wars in video game history, in which Sega positioned the Genesis as the &quot;cool&quot; console, with more mature titles aimed at older gamers, and edgy advertisements that occasionally attacked the competition. Nintendo however, scored an early public relations advantage by securing the first console conversion of Capcom's arcade classic Street Fighter II for SNES, which took over a year to make the transition to Genesis. Despite the Genesis's head start, much larger library of games, and lower price point, the Genesis only represented an estimated 60% of the American 16-bit console market in June 1992, and neither console could maintain a definitive lead for several years. Donkey Kong Country is said to have helped establish the SNES's market prominence in the latter years of the 16-bit generation, and for a time, maintain against the PlayStation and Saturn. According to Nintendo, the company had sold more than 20 million SNES units in the U.S. According to a 2014 Wedbush Securities report based on NPD sales data, the SNES ultimately outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What market did the Genesis target?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">older gamers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much sooner than the Genesis did the Street Fighter II game come out for SNES?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over a year</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the US 16-bit console market did the Genesis have in summer 1992?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What game was key to the SNES's success?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Donkey Kong Country</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many SNES units were sold in the US overall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 20 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system—the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's &quot;Ultra Games&quot; brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Nintendo's limit on games per developer per year on the NES?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What alternate name did Konami use to get around Nintendo's yearly limit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ultra Games</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how many years did Nintendo require exclusivity on NES games?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which competitor caused Nintendo to end its restrictions on game developers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sega</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which developer began releasing games for both NES and Sega in 1991?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Acclaim</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The company continued to carefully review submitted titles, giving them scores using a 40-point scale and allocating Nintendo's marketing resources accordingly.

One game, Mortal Kombat, would challenge this policy. A surprise hit in arcades in 1992, Mortal Kombat features splashes of blood and finishing moves that often depict one character dismembering the other.

With its detailed graphics, fluid animation and high-quality music, Donkey Kong Country rivaled the aesthetic quality of games that were being released on newer 32-bit CD-based consoles. In the last 45 days of 1994, the game sold 6.1 million units, making it the fastest-selling video game in history to that date.
