The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who identified the active substance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Abel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the method to obtain epinephrine in a pure state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jokichi Takamine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who marketed epinephrine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parke Davis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trade name was epinephrine marketed under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adrenalin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As an inhaler, what was epinephrine used to treat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nasal congestion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the method to get epinephrine in it's pure form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jokichi Takamine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could epinephrine treat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nasal congestion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did epinephrine stop being available in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trade name was epinephrine marketed under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adrenalin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was epinephrine discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1897</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the trade name of epinephrine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adrenalin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first discovered epinephrine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Abel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is epinephrine used to treat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">asthma attacks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Primatene Mist no longer sold in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While highly effective, the requirement for injection limited the use of norepinephrine[clarification needed] and orally active derivatives were sought. A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma. Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects, but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by Smith, Kline and French as a nasal decongestant under the trade name Benzedrine Inhaler. Amphetamine was eventually developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, post-encepheletic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications. It received approval as a New and Nonofficial Remedy from the American Medical Association for these uses in 1937 and remained in common use for depression until the development of tricyclic antidepressants in the 1960s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed Amphetamine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Smith, Kline and French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who synthesized Amphetamine for asthma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gordon Alles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are common side effects of Amphetamine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sensations of exhilaration and palpitations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were tricyclic antidepressants developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were some uses for Amphetamine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">narcolepsy, post-encepheletic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ephedrine was used as an oral medicine for what illness?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">asthma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was amphetamine first tested on asthma patients?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1929</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the trade name of amphetamine as a nasal decongestant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benzedrine Inhaler</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the American Medical Association approve amphetamine for medical use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1937</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade were tricyclic antidepressants created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A series of experiments performed from the late 1800s to the early 1900s revealed that diabetes is caused by the absence of a substance normally produced by the pancreas. In 1869, Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering found that diabetes could be induced in dogs by surgical removal of the pancreas. In 1921, Canadian professor Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best repeated this study, and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal. Soon, the extract was demonstrated to work in people, but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity. The researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at Eli Lilly and Co. based on the company's experience with large scale purification of biological materials. Chemist George Walden of Eli Lilly and Company found that careful adjustment of the pH of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced. Under pressure from Toronto University and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method, an agreement was reached for non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies. Prior to the discovery and widespread availability of insulin therapy the life expectancy of diabetics was only a few months.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is diabetes caused from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">absence of a substance normally produced by the pancreas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was insulin therapy delayed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can diabetes be induced in dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">surgical removal of the pancreas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before insulin, what was the life expectancy of diabetics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only a few months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered that pancreatic extract reversed symptoms of pancreas removal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Diabetes is caused by the removal of what organ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pancreas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Left untreated, how long were diabetic patients were expected to live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a few months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could be adjusted in a sample of pancreatic extract to produce purer insulin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pH</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To purify insulin, Banting and Best sought the assistance of what company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eli Lilly and Co.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Minkowski and von Mering did surgical tests on what animal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dogs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1903 Hermann Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering disclosed their discovery that diethylbarbituric acid, formed from the reaction of diethylmalonic acid, phosphorus oxychloride and urea, induces sleep in dogs. The discovery was patented and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers. Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is phenobarbital used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">epilepsy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered a reaction that induced sleep in dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hermann Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sleep aid was marketed in 1904?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Veronal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is amphetamine used for today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">attention deficit disorder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was barbiturates and amphetamines restricted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">addictive properties and abuse potential</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What compound was discovered to induce sleep?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diethylbarbituric acid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first trade name of diethylbarbituric acid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Veronal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is phenobarbital mainly used to treat today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">epilepsy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was phenobarbital discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1911</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Veronal used for when Bayer put it on the market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sleep aid</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1911 arsphenamine, the first synthetic anti-infective drug, was developed by Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim of the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin. The drug was given the commercial name Salvarsan. Ehrlich, noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria, hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections. Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds, and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity. Arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis, a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed Arsphenamine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first effective treatment for Syphilis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arsphenamine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What complications are associated with Syphilis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Amphetamine's market name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Institute of Experimental Therapy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Institute of Experimental Therapy located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Berlin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bacterial infections could be treated with medicines containing what kind of dye?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arsenic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first synthetic bacterial drug?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arsphenamine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Arsphenamine became the first treatment for what previously incurable disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">syphilis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was arsphenamine discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1911</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the commercial name of arsphenamine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Salvarsan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The modern pharmaceutical industry traces its roots to two sources. The first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s. Rational drug discovery from plants started particularly with the isolation of morphine, analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium, by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner, who named the compound after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. Multinational corporations including Merck, Hoffman-La Roche, Burroughs-Wellcome (now part of Glaxo Smith Kline), Abbott Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s. By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Morphine and Quinine first available?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid 1800s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the compound named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Morpheus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who came up with the name Morphine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Friedrich Sertürner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were was Morphine extracted from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for purification of compounds found in mineral sources?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German dye manufacturers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Morphine was named after what Greek god?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Morpheus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Burroughs-Wellcome is now part of what medical company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Glaxo Smith Kline</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered morphine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Friedrich Sertürner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the plant that produces morphine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opium</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ehrlich’s approach of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring the effects of these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including Bayer scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk. This work, also based in the testing of compounds available from the German dye industry, led to the development of Prontosil, the first representative of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics. Compared to arsphenamine, the sulfonamides had a broader spectrum of activity and were far less toxic, rendering them useful for infections caused by pathogens such as streptococci. In 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Nonetheless, the dramatic decrease in deaths from infectious diseases that occurred prior to World War II was primarily the result of improved public health measures such as clean water and less crowded housing, and the impact of anti-infective drugs and vaccines was significant mainly after World War II.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gerhard Domagk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prontosil is in what drug class?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antibiotics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for creating Prontosil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes Streptococci?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pathogens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many deaths occurred before World War II due to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infectious diseases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first sulfonamine antibiotic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prontosil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What award did Domagk receive in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nobel Prize in Medicine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Anti-infective drugs became more prominent after what war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were sulfonamides more or less toxic than arsphenamine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">less</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Streptococci and other pathogens could be treated by what type of antibiotics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sulfonamides</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the first rabies vaccine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many cases of Diphtheria were there in 1921?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">206,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1923, what was discovered to be safer to treat Diphtheria Toxin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formaldehyde</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created a vaccine to treat Japanese Encephalitis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maurice Hilleman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many deaths occurred due to Diphtheria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15,520</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The rabies vaccine was created in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1885</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the diphtheria vaccine made?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What compound made the diphtheria vaccine safer to use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formaldehyde</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the first encephalitis vaccine? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maurice Hilleman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company did Hilleman later work for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Merck</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1937 over 100 people died after ingesting &quot;Elixir Sulfanilamide&quot; manufactured by S.E.

The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004 the United States Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Polio vaccine created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1954</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who announced that SV40 was not associated with cancer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States Cancer Institute</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who identified the SV40 virus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maurice Hilleman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a complication of the SV40 virus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cause tumors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who funded the Polio vaccine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the polio vaccine created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1954</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the polio vaccine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jonas Salk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What virus caused tumors in most mammals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">SV40</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who identified the SV40 virus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maurice Hilleman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">SV40 was present in what vaccine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polio</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 2 July 2012, GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a $3 billion settlement of the largest health-care fraud case in the U.S. and the largest payment by a drug company.

This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad.

To the extent that such laws did exist, enforcement was lax. In the United States, increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs was spurred by tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs. This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs. A drug was considered misbranded if it contained alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, or any of several other potentially dangerous or addictive drugs, and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion of such drugs. The government's attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers for making unsupported claims of efficacy were undercut by a Supreme Court ruling restricting the federal government's enforcement powers to cases of incorrect specification of the drug's ingredients.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Act forbade misbranded drugs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pure Food and Drugs Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused a Tetanus outbreak?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What act allowed premarket approval for drugs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Biologics Control Act of 1902</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Pure Food and Drugs Act get implemented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1906</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who restricted the federal government's enforcement powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Supreme Court</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the law that required premarket approval for producing drugs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Biologics Control Act of 1902</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What law banned the interstate distribution of mislabeled food and drugs? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pure Food and Drugs Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Pure Food and Drugs Act passed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1906</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Patents have been criticized in the developing world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines.

In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read with the goals of public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who adopted the Doha Declaration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World Trade Organization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the TRIPS agreement accomplish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are patents criticized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thought to reduce access to existing medicines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Doha Declaration do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read with the goals of public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Doha Declaration adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been accused of reducing access to medicines in developing countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Patents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Doha Declaration allows for what ways for monopolies to be bypassed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">compulsory licensing or parallel imports</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the World Trade Organization adopt the Doha Declaration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pharmaceutical fraud involves deceptions which bring financial gain to a pharmaceutical company.

Based on fundamental research performed by Gregory Pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by Carl Djerassi at Syntex and by Frank Colton at G.D. Searle &amp; Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960. The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones, and caused severe side effects. Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were on the pill, and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million. The availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women, reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice, encouraging the delay of marriage, and increasing pre-marital co-habitation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What law prohibited birth control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Comstock laws</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Enovid first approved?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What increased due to the availability of birth control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pre-marital co-habitation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the first oral birth control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">E.D.

In 2010 18 NMEs (New Molecular Entities) were approved and three biologics by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year. This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD(not including marketing expenses). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much does it cost to develop a new drug?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 1.3 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many approvals of new drugs happen every year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">averaged 22.9 approvals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for approval or rejection of new drugs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Center for Drug Evaluation and Research</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many drugs were approved in 2007?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18 approvals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who reported the stable average rate in 2012?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Professors Light and Lexchin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does NMEs stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Molecular Entities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many pharmaceutical drugs were approved on average since 2001?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22.9</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the approximate cost of developing a new drug, including the costs of failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.3 billion USD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been the stable approval rate of new drugs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 to 25</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some of these estimates also take into account the opportunity cost of investing capital many years before revenues are realized (see Time-value of money).

However, only after rigorous study and testing, which takes 10 to 15 years on average, will governmental authorities grant permission for the company to market and sell the drug. Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug. When the patent protection for the drug expires, a generic drug is usually developed and sold by a competing company. The development and approval of generics is less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price. Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a generic version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market. Restructuring has therefore become routine, driven by the patent expiration of products launched during the industry's &quot;golden era&quot; in the 1990s and companies' failure to develop sufficient new blockbuster products to replace lost revenues.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long do drug exclusivity rights usually last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Governments grant permission to market drugs after how many years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 to 15 years on average</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What enables a drug's owner to recover R&amp;D costs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Patent protection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of drug is produced by competitors once a patent expires?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">generic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade was the pharmaceutical industry's &quot;golden era&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the United States, new pharmaceutical products must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as being both safe and effective.
