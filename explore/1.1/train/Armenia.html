Urartu was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. In the 1st century BC the Kingdom of Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the Great. Armenia became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion. In between the late 3rd century to early years of the 4th century, the state became the first Christian nation. The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301 AD. The ancient Armenian kingdom was split between the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires around the early 5th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of government does Armenia have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">democratic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did Armenia support?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who brought Armenia to success in the 1st century BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tigranes the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two empires did Armenia belong to in the beginning of the 5th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantine and Sasanian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Urartu created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">860 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Between the 16th century and 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of the Ottoman and successive Iranian empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, all non-Russian countries declared their independence from the Russian empire, leading to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into full Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two empires ruled Armenia between the 16 and 19th Century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ottoman and successive Iranian empires</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took over Eastern Armenia in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russian Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Armenian Genocide occure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Armenia become part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1920</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Armenia gain its independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription (515 BC) as Armina (    ).

One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Whilst under Soviet rule, Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some examples of Armenian folk music instruments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the duduk, the dhol, the zurna, and the kanun</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the Armenian alphabet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint Mesrop Mashtots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who composed the Sabre Dance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aram Khatchaturian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is known as one of the most prolific type of religious music in Armenia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Armenian chant</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called &quot;kef&quot; style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is kef?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did kef help do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Armenians emigrate from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional &quot;kef&quot; style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 1940s and 1950s for developing their own style of &quot;kef music&quot; heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time.
