It is generally accepted that Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them, and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims. However, Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. In this way, Principia Mathematica's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals. But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Despite its imperfection, what are now considered valuable achievements of Principia Mathematica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the general consensus of the axioms and inference rules declared in Principia Mathematica? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mixed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered the incompleteness theorem of 1931?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kurt Gödel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the incompleteness theorem of 1931 indicate regarding Principia Mathematica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Gödels finding ironic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Kurt Godel's incompleteness theorem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1931</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Kurt Godel's theorem demonstrate about axioms and the inference rules?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Godel couldn't have come to his conclusion without what book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Principia Mathematica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides logic and epistemology, what else did Principia Mathematica connect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metaphysics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Whitehead's most complete work on education is the 1929 book The Aims of Education and Other Essays, which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927.

He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its experience. He used the term &quot;experience&quot; very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental.

After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience.

In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. &quot;Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person&quot;). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete &quot;occasions of experience&quot; that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as &quot;the essence of a thing&quot; or &quot;the identity/core of a person&quot; is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. Identities do not define people, people define identities.

After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago. Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that &quot;material substances&quot; or &quot;essences&quot; are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Whitehead think people continued to subscribe to materialistic thinking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead believe regarding factors that limit people's understanding of his concepts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">should not prevent people from realizing that &quot;material substances&quot; or &quot;essences&quot; are a convenient generalized description of a continuum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead believe was one of the biggest reasons materialistic thinking endured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">limitations of language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead state about the belief that a person is exactly the same from moment to moment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it is not philosophically or ontologically sound</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why couldn't each moment of each person's life be given a different proper name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">limitations of language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead believe was a culprit in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">limitations of language</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whitehead's main philosophy on humans changing is what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations.

Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete, with the discovery of gravitational waves. They are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes. Consequently, Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation. An exact replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry.

Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which decade did Whitehead's focus start shifting away from mathematics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1910s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After moving away from mathematics, what subjects did Whitehead explore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As opposed to physical objects, what did Whitehead believe reality is composed of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">processes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the predominant theory of reality that Whitehead opposed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book of Whitehead's is now considered a primary source of process philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Process and Reality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead first study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mathematics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Whitehead's second area of study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philosophy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Whitehead's final area of study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metaphysics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of system did he develop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metaphysical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead argue reality consists of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">processes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Alfred North Whitehead was born in Ramsgate, Kent, England, in 1861.

Whitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as he never mentioned her in any of his writings, and there is evidence that Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Alfred North Whitehead born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ramsgate, Kent, England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Whitehead born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1861</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Chatham House Academy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Whitehead, Alfred North's grandfather</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Whitehead's father's profession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">minister and schoolmaster of Chatham House Academy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Whitehead's mother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Alfred North Whitehead born? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ramsgate, Kent, England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Whitehead born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1861</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Whitehead's father's profession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">minister and schoolmaster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Whitehead's mother's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maria Sarah Whitehead,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Whitehead's wife's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Evelyn</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1918 Whitehead's academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the University of London system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time.

It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. For Whitehead, the term &quot;prehension&quot; indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them.

However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, &quot;might not have jumped to the notion of a chair&quot;, but instead &quot;might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.&quot; This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog &quot;would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.&quot; In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which concept does Whitehead state is more dominant in a lower mentality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">causal relationships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Whitehead's term for the two modes of perceptions combining?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">symbolic reference</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dominates more basic mentality in symbolic reference?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">causal relationships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does symbolic reference link appearance with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">causation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does having sense perceptions conclude about a person?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">higher grade mentality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of symbolic reference?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Whitehead describe the process of a typical person noticing a chair?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How might an artist view a chair differently than a typical person?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Whitehead say a dog may interpret the presence of a chair?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Whitehead makes the startling observation that &quot;life is comparatively deficient in survival value.&quot; If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, &quot;they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them.&quot; He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better.

While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others. His most famous remark on religion is that &quot;religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious.&quot; Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's character. He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good – an idea which he called a &quot;dangerous delusion&quot; (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead believe was the basis of religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Whitehead's most famous statement on religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Whitehead define religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a system of general truths that transformed a person's character</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Whitehead define &quot;dangerous delusion&quot; as it relates to religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, while Whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual. In keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of &quot;the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals.&quot; In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others – meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community. Whitehead writes further that each entity &quot;can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe. Religion is world-loyalty. The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself.&quot; In this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what state did Whitehead believe religion began?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">solitariness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What realization did Whitehead believe religion made necessary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead believe was necessary for an entity to have meaning and value?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Whitehead describe religion as world-loyalty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Whitehead believe was the relationship between the individual and social aspects of religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Overall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize. In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs. Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself. For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine, both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy – the dominant strain of philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century. Whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the continental tradition, such as French post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that &quot;he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror.&quot; French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour even went so far as to call Whitehead &quot;the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where has interest outside of those areas mainly come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through the work of his students and admirers rather</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What French sociologist and anthropologist stated that Whitehead was &quot;the greatest philosopher of the 20th century&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bruno Latour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are Whitehead's works primarily studied in English-speaking countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are two of Whitehead's students that have gone on to become renowned in the field of analytic philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Gilles Deleuze say about Whitehead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Historically Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of American progressive theology.

Rather than seeing God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as &quot;the fellow sufferer who understands&quot;, and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events. Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God? Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways. C.
