In 1524, the municipality of Mexico City was established, known as México Tenochtitlán, and as of 1585 it was officially known as Ciudad de México (Mexico City).

In recent years, the local government has passed a wave of liberal policies, such as abortion on request, a limited form of euthanasia, no-fault divorce, and same-sex marriage. On January 29, 2016, it ceased to be called the Federal District (Spanish: Distrito Federal or D.F.) and is now in transition to become the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state.

Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread.

Spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. Spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it. In the ensuing centuries, possession of a noble title in Mexico did not mean one exercised great political power, for one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not. The concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family. Most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in New Spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. The craze to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Many of these palaces can still be seen today, leading to Mexico City's nickname of &quot;The city of palaces&quot; given by Alexander Von Humboldt.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a common nickname for Mexico City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The city of palaces</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did mexican nobles spend money in Mexico City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the construction of exuberant houses slow down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the last half of the 18th century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Grito de Dolores (&quot;Cry of Dolores&quot;) also known as El Grito de la Independencia (&quot;Cry of Independence&quot;), uttered from the small town of Dolores near Guanajuato on September 16, 1810, is the event that marks the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence and is the most important national holiday observed in Mexico. The &quot;Grito&quot; was the battle cry of the Mexican War of Independence by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Roman Catholic priest. Hidalgo and several criollos were involved in a planned revolt against the Spanish colonial government, and the plotters were betrayed. Fearing his arrest, Hidalgo commanded his brother Mauricio as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release the pro-independence inmates there on the night of September 15. They managed to set eighty free. Around 6:00 am September 16, 1810, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation. Flanked by Allende and Juan Aldama, he addressed the people in front of his church, encouraging them to revolt. The Battle of Guanajuato, the first major engagement of the insurgency, occurred four days later. Mexico's independence from Spain was effectively declared in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 27, 1821, after a decade of war. Unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of Mexico.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Mexico gain independence? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 27, 1821</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a decade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first battle of the Mexican Independence war called? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Battle of Guanajuato</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the battle cry of the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grito</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the war begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 16, 1810</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Battle for Mexico City was the series of engagements from September 8 to September 15, 1847, in the general vicinity of Mexico City during the Mexican–American War.

This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called groundwater-related subsidence. Since the beginning of the 20th century the city has sunk as much as nine metres (30 feet) in some areas. This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the rainy season.

The metro is one of the busiest in the world transporting approximately 4.5 million people every day, surpassed only by subway lines in Moscow (7.5 million), Tokyo (5.9 million), and New York City (5.1 million). It is heavily subsidized, and has some of the lowest fares in the world, each trip costing 5.00 pesos from 05:00 am to midnight. Several stations display pre-Columbian artifacts and architecture that were discovered during the metro's construction.[citation needed] However, the metro covers less than half of the total urban area. The Metro stations are also differentiated by the use of icons and glyphs which were proposed for people who could not read. The specific icons were developed based on historical (characters, sites, pre-Hispanic motifs), linguistic, symbolic (glyphs) or location references and has being emulated in further transportations alternatives in the City and in other Mexican cities. Mexico City is the only city in the world to use the icon reference and has become a popular culture trademark for the city.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How large is the metro system of Mexico City?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">225.9 km (140 mi)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Mexico City metro system first opened?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1969</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many lines are in the metro system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people ride the metro system each day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4.5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many stations are in the Mexico City metro system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">195</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city's first bus rapid transit line, the Metrobús, began operation in June 2005, along Avenida Insurgentes.
