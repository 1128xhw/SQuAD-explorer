For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Feynman proposed a integral model in particle physics, what was it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parton model</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the two men that won the Nobel Prize in Physics with Feynman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Feynman win his Nobel Prize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Feynman was famous for diagrams that showed how subatomic particles behaved, what are these known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Feynman diagrams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What honor did Feynman recieve in a 1999 poll conducted by British Journal Physics World?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At which college did Feyman turn down a job?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Institute for Advanced Study</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Feyman accept a job after the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cornell University</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which colleague did Feynman follow to Cornell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hans Bethe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">His work at Cornell helped contribute to his what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nobel Prize–winning work</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Feynman go through a depression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">destruction of Hiroshima by the bomb</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite yet another offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, Feynman rejected the Institute on the grounds that there were no teaching duties: Feynman felt that students were a source of inspiration and teaching was a diversion during uncreative spells.

He gained a reputation for taking great care when giving explanations to his students and for making it a moral duty to make the topic accessible. His guiding principle was that, if a topic could not be explained in a freshman lecture, it was not yet fully understood. Feynman gained great pleasure from coming up with such a &quot;freshman-level&quot; explanation, for example, of the connection between spin and statistics. What he said was that groups of particles with spin ½ &quot;repel&quot;, whereas groups with integer spin &quot;clump&quot;. This was a brilliantly simplified way of demonstrating how Fermi–Dirac statistics and Bose–Einstein statistics evolved as a consequence of studying how fermions and bosons behave under a rotation of 360°. This was also a question he pondered in his more advanced lectures, and to which he demonstrated the solution in the 1986 Dirac memorial lecture. In the same lecture, he further explained that antiparticles must exist, for if particles had only positive energies, they would not be restricted to a so-called &quot;light cone&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which nickname did Feynman receive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Explainer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Feynman believed that if a topic was not easily accessible to freshmen than it was not yet what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fully understood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In a lecture, Feynman said that what had to exist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antiparticles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Antiparticles had to exist because if particles only were of positive energy, they would not be in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light cone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>He also developed Feynman diagrams, a bookkeeping device that helps in conceptualizing and calculating interactions between particles in spacetime, including the interactions between electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons.

Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as &quot;put-ons&quot;. In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What model did Murray Gell-Mann develop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quark model</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What model did Feynman produce to complement the quark model?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parton model</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Quarks were thought of as what in the 1960s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not real particles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scientist experimented with blasting alpha particles at the nuclei of gold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ernest Rutherford</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the fifth quark was discovered, Feynman said what had to also exist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sixth quark</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to quantum gravity.

After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics. He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book. Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword. The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including The Character of Physical Law, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman Lectures on Computation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which society was Feynman elected to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After 3 years at Caltech what lectures did Feynman produce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Feynman Lectures on Physics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did publisher change the cover picture on Feynman's book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">connections to drugs and rock and roll</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In his book, Feynman was shown playing what instrument?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drums</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the book Feynman wrote over light and matter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Character of Physical Law, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1974, Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience due to a lack of &quot;a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty&quot; on the part of the scientist.

Responding to Hubert Humphrey's congratulation for his Nobel Prize, Feynman admitted to a long admiration for the then vice president.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Feynman work at in Brazil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brazilian Center for Physics Research</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which place in Russia could Feynman not visit, but wished to do so?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tuva</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Feynman allowed to go to Tuva?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The day after he died</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the film that discusses Feynman's attempt to get to Tuva?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genghis Blues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who went to Tuva in Feynman's stead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Feynman's daughter Michelle</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Genius, the James Gleick-authored biography, Feynman tried LSD during his professorship at Caltech.

When the county officials tried to close the place, all visitors except Feynman refused to testify in favor of the bar, fearing that their families or patrons would learn about their visits. Only Feynman accepted, and in court, he affirmed that the bar was a public need, stating that craftsmen, technicians, engineers, common workers, &quot;and a physics professor&quot; frequented the establishment. While the bar lost the court case, it was allowed to remain open as a similar case was pending appeal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which book does Feynman detail was to pick up girls?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was his second office at Caltech?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">topless bar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the only person to testify that the topless bar should remain open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Feynman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Feynman write down his equations at the topless bar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paper placemats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to shut the topless bar down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">county officials</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In a 1992 New York Times article on Feynman and his legacy, James Gleick recounts the story of how Murray Gell-Mann described what has become known as &quot;The Feynman Algorithm&quot; or &quot;The Feynman Problem-Solving Algorithm&quot; to a student: &quot;The student asks Gell-Mann about Feynman's notes.

Leighton and Matthew Sands, colleagues of Feynman, edited and illustrated them into book form. The work has endured and is useful to this day.
