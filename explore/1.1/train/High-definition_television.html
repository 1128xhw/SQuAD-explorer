The Baird system was discontinued in February 1937. In 1938 France followed with their own 441-line system, variants of which were also used by a number of other countries. The US NTSC 525-line system joined in 1941. In 1949 France introduced an even higher-resolution standard at 819 lines, a system that should have been high definition even by today's standards, but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable. All of these systems used interlacing and a 4:3 aspect ratio except the 240-line system which was progressive (actually described at the time by the technically correct term &quot;sequential&quot;) and the 405-line system which started as 5:4 and later changed to 4:3. The 405-line system adopted the (at that time) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 Hz frame rate. The 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth, an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 MHz.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who started trials in August 1936?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The British high-definition TV service</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Baird system discontinued?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 1937</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country developed the 441-line system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What prevented France's 819-line system from achieving the definition it was capable of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the technical limitations of the time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which system used interlaced scanning to correct the flicker problem of the 240-line?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">405-line system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Colour broadcasts started at similarly higher resolutions, first with the US NTSC color system in 1953, which was compatible with the earlier monochrome systems and therefore had the same 525 lines of resolution.

This new system, NHK Color, created in 1972, included 1125 lines, a 5:3 aspect ratio and 60 Hz refresh rate. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), headed by Charles Ginsburg, became the testing and study authority for HDTV technology in the international theater.

These broadcasting systems can be used for both SDTV and HDTV. In the US the Grand Alliance proposed ATSC as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV. Both ATSC and DVB were based on the MPEG-2 standard, although DVB systems may also be used to transmit video using the newer and more efficient H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression standards. Common for all DVB standards is the use of highly efficient modulation techniques for further reducing bandwidth, and foremost for reducing receiver-hardware and antenna requirements.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Grand Alliance propose as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ATSC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which standard were ATSC and DVB based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MPEG-2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the standard for DVB-2, DVB-C, and DVB-T?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DVB</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who proposed ATSC as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Grand Alliance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1983, the International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) set up a working party (IWP11/6) with the aim of setting a single international HDTV standard. One of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame/field refresh rate, the world already having split into two camps, 25/50 Hz and 30/60 Hz, largely due to the differences in mains frequency. The IWP11/6 working party considered many views and throughout the 1980s served to encourage development in a number of video digital processing areas, not least conversion between the two main frame/field rates using motion vectors, which led to further developments in other areas. While a comprehensive HDTV standard was not in the end established, agreement on the aspect ratio was achieved.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did ITU-R start trying to work towards setting a single international HDTV standard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1983</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did ITU-R start trying to do in 1983?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">setting a single international HDTV standard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the issues with setting a single HDTV standard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a suitable frame/field refresh rate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was used as a conversion between the two main frame/field rates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">motion vectors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many frame/field rates were primarily being used in 1983?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Initially the existing 5:3 aspect ratio had been the main candidate but, due to the influence of widescreen cinema, the aspect ratio 16:9 (1.78) eventually emerged as being a reasonable compromise between 5:3 (1.67) and the common 1.85 widescreen cinema format.

Field testing of HDTV at 199 sites in the United States was completed August 14, 1994. The first public HDTV broadcast in the United States occurred on July 23, 1996 when the Raleigh, North Carolina television station WRAL-HD began broadcasting from the existing tower of WRAL-TV southeast of Raleigh, winning a race to be first with the HD Model Station in Washington, D.C., which began broadcasting July 31, 1996 with the callsign WHD-TV, based out of the facilities of NBC owned and operated station WRC-TV. The American Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) HDTV system had its public launch on October 29, 1998, during the live coverage of astronaut John Glenn's return mission to space on board the Space Shuttle Discovery.
