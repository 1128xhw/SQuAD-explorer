He used the black swan fallacy to discuss falsification. If the outcome of an experiment contradicts the theory, one should refrain from ad hoc manoeuvres that evade the contradiction merely by making it less falsifiable. Popper is also known for his opposition to the classical justificationist account of knowledge, which he replaced with critical rationalism, &quot;the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which classical views about the method of science did Popper reject?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inductivist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who proposed empirical falsification as the central principle of the scientific method?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Popper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is necessary for a scientific theory to be falsified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decisive experiments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which account of knowledge did Popper contest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classical justificationist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for Popper's non-justificational theory of criticism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">critical rationalism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Karl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902, to upper middle-class parents. All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Grübl and, after Grübl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Grübl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Grübl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library. Popper inherited both the library and the disposition from him.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which city was Karl Popper born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vienna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did Popper's family observe during his youth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lutheranism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose law firm did Popper's father join in Vienna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burgomaster Herr Grübl</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What numerical range of volumes did Popper's father keep in his library?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12,000–14,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What disposition regarding books did Popper inherit from his father?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bibliophile</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Popper left school at the age of 16 and attended lectures in mathematics, physics, philosophy, psychology and the history of music as a guest student at the University of Vienna. In 1919, Popper became attracted by Marxism and subsequently joined the Association of Socialist School Students. He also became a member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria, which was at that time a party that fully adopted the Marxist ideology. After the street battle in the Hörlgasse on 15 June 1919, when police shot eight of his unarmed party comrades, he became disillusioned by what he saw to be the &quot;pseudo-scientific&quot; historical materialism of Marx, abandoned the ideology, and remained a supporter of social liberalism throughout his life.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At which age did Popper first attend university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What political doctrine interested Popper in 1919?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marxism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Austrian political party did Popper join as a youth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What incident killed several of Poppers Marxist political comrades?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">street battle in the Hörlgasse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To which political philosophy did Popper continue to adhere after moving away from Marxism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social liberalism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>He worked in street construction for a short amount of time, but was unable to cope with the heavy labour. Continuing to attend university as a guest student, he started an apprenticeship as cabinetmaker, which he completed as a journeyman. He was dreaming at that time of starting a daycare facility for children, for which he assumed the ability to make furniture might be useful. After that he did voluntary service in one of psychoanalyst Alfred Adler's clinics for children. In 1922, he did his matura by way of a second chance education and finally joined the University as an ordinary student. He completed his examination as an elementary teacher in 1924 and started working at an after-school care club for socially endangered children. In 1925, he went to the newly founded Pädagogisches Institut and continued studying philosophy and psychology. Around that time he started courting Josefine Anna Henninger, who later became his wife.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trade did Popper enter as an apprentice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cabinetmaker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of facility did Popper plan to open that would benefit from his furniture-making skills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">daycare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which psychoanalysts clinics did Popper volunteer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alfred Adler</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Popper become an ordinary student rather than a guest at university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1922</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which vocation did Popper complete his university examinations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elementary teacher</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1928, he earned a doctorate in psychology, under the supervision of Karl Bühler.

In 1929, he obtained the authorisation to teach mathematics and physics in secondary school, which he started doing. He married his colleague Josefine Anna Henninger (1906–1985) in 1930. Fearing the rise of Nazism and the threat of the Anschluss, he started to use the evenings and the nights to write his first book Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie (The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge). He needed to publish one to get some academic position in a country that was safe for people of Jewish descent. However, he ended up not publishing the two-volume work, but a condensed version of it with some new material, Logik der Forschung (The Logic of Scientific Discovery), in 1934. Here, he criticised psychologism, naturalism, inductionism, and logical positivism, and put forth his theory of potential falsifiability as the criterion demarcating science from non-science. In 1935 and 1936, he took unpaid leave to go to the United Kingdom for a study visit.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supervised Popper's doctorate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karl Bühler</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an English translation of the title of Popper's doctoral thesis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The question of method in cognitive psychology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subjects was Popper authorized to teach in secondary school in 1929?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mathematics and physics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose rise to power motivated Popper to publish his work in hopes of obtaining an academic position abroad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nazism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which work published in 1934 did Popper introduce his theories centered around falsifiability?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Logic of Scientific Discovery</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1937, Popper finally managed to get a position that allowed him to emigrate to New Zealand, where he became lecturer in philosophy at Canterbury University College of the University of New Zealand in Christchurch. It was here that he wrote his influential work The Open Society and its Enemies. In Dunedin he met the Professor of Physiology John Carew Eccles and formed a lifelong friendship with him. In 1946, after the Second World War, he moved to the United Kingdom to become reader in logic and scientific method at the London School of Economics. Three years later, in 1949, he was appointed professor of logic and scientific method at the University of London. Popper was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1958 to 1959. He retired from academic life in 1969, though he remained intellectually active for the rest of his life. In 1985, he returned to Austria so that his wife could have her relatives around her during the last months of her life; she died in November that year. After the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft failed to establish him as the director of a newly founded branch researching the philosophy of science, he went back again to the United Kingdom in 1986, settling in Kenley, Surrey.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Popper move in 1937?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Zealand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Popper's academic appointment in New Zealand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canterbury University College of the University of New Zealand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which lifelong friend did Popper make in Dunedin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Carew Eccles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophical fields did Popper teach at the London School of Economics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">logic and scientific method</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Austrian school's failure to give Popper a directorship prompted him to return to the United Kingdom at the end of his life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Popper died of &quot;complications of cancer, pneumonia and kidney failure&quot; in Kenley at the age of 92 on 17 September 1994.

After cremation, his ashes were taken to Vienna and buried at Lainzer cemetery adjacent to the ORF Centre, where his wife Josefine Anna Popper (called ‘Hennie’) had already been buried. Popper's estate is managed by his secretary and personal assistant Melitta Mew and her husband Raymond. Popper's manuscripts went to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, partly during his lifetime and partly as supplementary material after his death. Klagenfurt University possesses Popper's library, including his precious bibliophilia, as well as hard copies of the original Hoover material and microfilms of the supplementary material.

Although he quickly became disillusioned with the views expounded by Marxism, his flirtation with the ideology led him to distance himself from those who believed that spilling blood for the sake of a revolution was necessary.

In contrast, nothing could, even in principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories.

The nature of such theories made it impossible for any criticism or experiment - even in principle - to show them to be false. This realisation had an important consequence when Popper later tackled the problem of demarcation in the philosophy of science, as it led him to posit that the strength of a scientific theory lies in its both being susceptible to falsification, and not actually being falsified by criticism made of it. He considered that if a theory cannot, in principle, be falsified by criticism, it is not a scientific theory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Popper, a theory is scientific only is it is susceptible to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">falsification</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What key components of science are ineffective when brought to bear on non-scientific theories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">criticism or experiment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Popper characterize the wide applicability and immunity to criticism of psychoanalytic theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">weaknesses</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Popper coined the term &quot;critical rationalism&quot; to describe his philosophy.

He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination to solve problems that have arisen in specific historico-cultural settings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term did Popper use for his philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">critical rationalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which account of scientific method did Popper's repudiate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the classical observationalist-inductivist account</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Popper's position on classical empiricism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rejection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Popper, what is the only way one can test scientific theories because they are necessarily abstract?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indirectly</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false.

Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable.

Again, in this context the word &quot;falsified&quot; does not refer to something being &quot;fake&quot;; rather, that something can be (i.e., is capable of being) shown to be false by observation or experiment. Some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false, and therefore, are not falsifiable. If so, then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a growth in knowledge?

Consequently, just as a species' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has, over many generations, produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper's view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more interesting problems ().

He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to mind-body dualism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Popper argue was objective and independent of its subject?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">knowledge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many different worlds or realities did Popper differentiate in Objective Knowledge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What constituted World One in Popper's theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the physical world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who produced the contents of World Three?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individual human beings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which world's evolution corresponds to the growth of human knowledge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World Three</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The creation–evolution controversy in the United States raises the issue of whether creationistic ideas may be legitimately called science and whether evolution itself may be legitimately called science.

This control organ plays a special role in evolution—it is the &quot;spearhead of evolution&quot;. The goals bring the purpose into the world. Mutations in the genes that determine the structure of the control may then cause drastic changes in behaviour, preferences and goals, without having an impact on the organism's phenotype.

An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet Neptune: when the motion of Uranus was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory &quot;There are seven planets in the solar system&quot; was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of naïve falsificationism in Chapters 3 and 4 of The Logic of Scientific Discovery. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value.

These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category.

An event that happened in 1919 had a profound effect on him: During a riot, caused by the Communists, the police shot several unarmed people, including some of Popper's friends, when they tried to free party comrades from prison. The riot had, in fact, been part of a plan by which leaders of the Communist party with connections to Béla Kun tried to take power by a coup; Popper did not know about this at that time. However, he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the Marxist doctrine that class struggle would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible, and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class. This was the start of his later criticism of historicism.
