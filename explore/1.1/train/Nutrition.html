They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs, are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs. Government regulation especially in terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease. In order to become board certified, potential CNS candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including; Clinical Intervention and Human Health.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does RDN stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Registered dietitian nutritionists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who offers dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic diseases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Certified Clinical Nutritionists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which health professional is Governmental regulation more universal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">RDN</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who typically specializes in obesity and chronic disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Certified Nutrition Specialist</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Walter Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of Qi developed, a spirit or &quot;wind&quot; similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma. Food was classified into &quot;hot&quot; (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and &quot;cold&quot; (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia. Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi. Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets. About the same time in Italy, Alcmaeon of Croton (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result disease marked by obesity or emaciation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which time period did the study of nutrition begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6th century BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the European equivalent of &quot;Qi&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pneuma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of food classification does ginger belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nationality was Alcmaeon of Croton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than obesity, what else would trademark an imbalance in nutrition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emaciation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first recorded nutritional experiment with human subjects is found in the Bible's Book of Daniel.

Galen was physician to gladiators in Pergamon, and in Rome, physician to Marcus Aurelius and the three emperors who succeeded him. Most of Galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by Benedictine monks at the School of Salerno in Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum, which still had users in the 17th century. Galen believed in the bodily humours of Hippocrates, and he taught that pneuma is the source of life. Four elements (earth, air, fire and water) combine into &quot;complexion&quot;, which combines into states (the four temperaments: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist, cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of four humours: blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the elements). Galen thought that for a person to have gout, kidney stones, or arthritis was scandalous, which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler's Erehwon (1872) where sickness is a crime.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was the doctrines of Galen in use for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1500 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which famous emperor did Galen serve as a physician to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marcus Aurelius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who resided at the School of Salerno in Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benedictine monks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Galen believe that pneuma was?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the source of life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did each pair of attributes supposedly consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four humours</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1500s, Paracelsus was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly. Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen. Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius, sometimes called the father of modern medicine, overturned Galen's ideas. He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide, performed the first quantitative experiment. Robert Boyle advanced chemistry. Sanctorius measured body weight. Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process.

William Prout in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein. During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology, Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value. In the 1860s, Claude Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which dietary component was not fed to dogs resulting in their death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">protein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first began dividing foods into categories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Prout</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Justus von Liebig argue with over the belief that animals get protein from plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean-Baptiste Dumas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which credientials did Liebig lack despite being a leading organic chemist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">animal physiology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be synthesized using carbohydrates and proteins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">body fat</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early 1880s, Kanehiro Takaki observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed beriberi (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not.

Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing protein, the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration; the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than fats, what else consists of atoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">carbohydrates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If a carbohydrate is not a simple monosaccharide, what else could it be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">complex polysaccharides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones make up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">triglycerides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What characteristic about fatty acids requires them to be an essential component in a diet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cannot be synthesized in the body</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which element do the amino acids that make up the core component of protein have in common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nitrogen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Traditionally, simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates.

Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What example of a carbohydrate is unable to be fully absorbed in humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dietary fiber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many kilocalories of energy per gram is dietary fiber able to produce when successfully metabolized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main component that makes up dietary fiber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cellulose</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a gastrointestinal problem other than diarrhea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">constipation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does soluble fiber do to help lower blood glucose levels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">slow the absorption of sugar</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat.

However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these &quot;omega&quot; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does it mean when it is claimed that many fatty acids are non - essential?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the body can produce them as needed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At least how many fatty acids are essential to the human health and have to be consumed rather than produced by the body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does EPA stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eicosapentaenoic acid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Outside of consumption, what would be broken down in the body to obtain DGLA and AA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">omega-6 linoleic acid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do people consume that has low amounts of the necessary essential fatty acids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">processed vegetable oils</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2.

Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e., cell division).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is able to prevent AA from being released from membranes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Omega-3 EPA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The conversion of omega-6 DGLA to AA is able to help regulate which process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of process is the conversion of DGLA to AA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">desaturation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a hormone other than insulin that is able to control the enzyme delta-5-desaturase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glucagon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the scientific name for cell division?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mitosis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance).

However the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: &quot;An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.&quot; More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.” For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food. Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example. These values are estimated using country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Other guidelines for nutrition also have implications for the beverages we consume for healthy hydration- for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that added sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the early recommended amount of water that was supposedly required to keep the body hydrated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6–8 glasses of water daily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who originally made a water intake recommendation in 1945?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much water should be taken in for each calorie of food that is consumed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1 milliliter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does ADI stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">adequate daily intakes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do humans get the 20% of water that does not come from the beverages we drink?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">food</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations.

Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For the continued normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight). Phytochemicals (Section Below) and their subgroup, polyphenols, make up the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known. Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network. For example, Vitamin C can reactivate free radical-containing glutathione or Vitamin E by accepting the free radical itself. Some antioxidants are more effective than others at neutralizing different free radicals. Some cannot neutralize certain free radicals. Some cannot be present in certain areas of free radical development (Vitamin A is fat-soluble and protects fat areas, Vitamin C is water-soluble and protects those areas). When interacting with a free radical, some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound that is less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound. Having a variety of antioxidants allows any byproducts to be safely dealt with by more efficient antioxidants in neutralizing a free radical's butterfly effect.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term that can be used to describe &quot;potentially damaging&quot; compounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mutation causing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are oxidizers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acceptors of electrons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In order for the body to function normally, what must be used to neutralize free radicals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">antioxidant compounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subgroup of phytochemicals helps make up the majority of the body's antioxidants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polyphenols</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which area of the body does vitamin A protect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fat areas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Animal intestines contain a large population of gut flora.

The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy than those above it.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which country were there no specific nutritional literacy studies on a national level that could be found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the abbreviation NAAL represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Assessment of Adult Literacy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Americans were found to have intermediate health literacy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">44%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Americans fell below the basics of health literacy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">People who had a lower health literacy rate were found to be living below what standard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">level of poverty</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills.

Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances. Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing.

In addition, processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Centrifugation and pressing are prime examples of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Modern separation techniques</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">An unfortunate side effect of concentrating food components is that it causes what change in the food?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nutritional content</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of nutritional value do the processed foods have in comparison to their fresh variants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reduced</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term other than 'fortified' that can be used to describe the addition of nutrients to processed food?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enriched</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Outside of oxidized fats, what is another substance that is deemed harmful that can be found in processed foods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trans fatty acids</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of beri-beri in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin thiamine, causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by Pasteur) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did people who became ill with beri-beri have as their main food source?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polished rice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What vitamin is removed during the polishing of rice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thiamine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which disease became prevalent among infants in the United States as an effect of processed foods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scurvy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What treatment did the milk that was fed to infants undergo to control bacterial disease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pasteurisation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was destroyed during the pasteurisation of the milk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vitamin C</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is undoubtedly a cause of the increase in obesity related diseases that are becoming prevalent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">widespread application of some modern food processing technologies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aside from agricultural subsidizing, what else does the food processing industry influence in terms of political decisions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nutritional recommendations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is perceived as the general priority of the food processing industry in this sort of economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The more expensive fresh foods have what nutritional value in relation to processed food?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">superior</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than being cheaper, what is another main draw of processed foods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more convenient</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
