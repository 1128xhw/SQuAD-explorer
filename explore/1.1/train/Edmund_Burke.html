His mother Mary née Nagle (c. 1702 – 1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a déclassé County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burke dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Burke born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dublin, Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Burke's mother's maiden name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nagle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke's mother die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1770</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke's father die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1761</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke's ancestors arrive in Ireland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1185</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1744, Burke started at Trinity College Dublin, a Protestant establishment, which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take degrees. In 1747, he set up a debating society, &quot;Edmund Burke's Club&quot;, which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the Middle Temple, before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe.

It was to be submitted for publication by Christmas 1758. Burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped; it was not published until after Burke's death, being included in an 1812 collection of his works, entitled An Essay Towards an Abridgement of the English History. G. M. Young did not value Burke's history and claimed that it was &quot;demonstrably a translation from the French&quot;.

His most important publication in this regard was his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents of 23 April 1770. Burke identified the &quot;discontents&quot; as stemming from the &quot;secret influence&quot; of a neo-Tory group he labelled as, the &quot;king's friends&quot;, whose system &quot;comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, Double Cabinet&quot;.

He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in America would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. &quot;An armament&quot;, Burke said, &quot;is not a victory&quot;. Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home. Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic – the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Burke worried Britain might not win a war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">America</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many reasons against violence did Burke present?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far away was the potential conflict Burke argued against?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thousands of miles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area could the American colonists retreat to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mountains</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on Lord Bathurst (1684–1775); Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: &quot;Young man, There is America – which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world&quot;.

Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property.

His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation. In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the East India Company when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke's primary concern. This committee was charged &quot;to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties&quot;. While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the Indian princes that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the HEIC recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that &quot;began 'in commerce' but 'ended in empire.'&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Warren Hastings impeached?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1786</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Hastings formerly the governor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bengal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long before Hastings's trial had Britain been dealing with Indian unrest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two decades</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Burke made chairman of in 1781?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Burke said the Indian problems 'began in commerce', where did he say the problems ended in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">empire</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 4 April 1786, Burke presented the Commons with the Article of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanors against Hastings. The impeachment in Westminster Hall, which did not begin until 14 February 1788, would be the &quot;first major public discursive event of its kind in England&quot;, bringing the morality and duty of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke already was known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance. Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'. The House of Commons eventually impeached Hastings, but subsequently, the House of Lords acquitted him of all charges.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke charge Hastings for impeachment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4 April 1786</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the impeachment formally called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Article of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which house acquitted Hastings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Lords</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which house impeached Hastings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Commons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Like what creature did Burke say Hastings was 'devouring the dead'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ravenous vulture</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Initially, Burke did not condemn the French Revolution. In a letter of 9 August 1789, Burke wrote: &quot;England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner&quot;. The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: &quot;This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable&quot;. On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken &quot;as no more than the expression of doubt&quot; but he added: &quot;You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom&quot;. In the same month he described France as &quot;a country undone&quot;. Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Parisian women want to return to Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Louis XVI</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Burke's son's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard Burke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who requested that Burke support the French Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles-Jean-François Depont</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke first publicly condemn the French Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9 February 1790</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In January 1790, Burke read Dr. Richard Price's sermon of 4 November 1789 entitled, A Discourse on the Love of our Country, to the Revolution Society.

Price argued that love of our country &quot;does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government&quot;.

On 1 November he finally published the Reflections and it was an immediate best-seller. Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, but by the end of 1790, it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator, Pierre-Gaëton Dupont, wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold.

Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is &quot;the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages&quot; and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. &quot;Prejudice&quot;, Burke claimed, &quot;is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit&quot;.

Philip Francis wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was &quot;pure foppery&quot;. Edward Gibbon, however, reacted differently: &quot;I adore his chivalry&quot;. Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been &quot;led in triumph&quot; during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was featured in the most well-known part of Burke's Reflections?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marie-Antoinette</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said Burke wrote 'pure foppery' about Marie-Antoinette?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip Francis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who adored Burke's chivalry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward Gibbon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Marie-Antoinette react to Burke's writing about her?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">she burst into tears</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Louis XVI translated the Reflections &quot;from end to end&quot; into French.

Other Whigs such as the Duke of Portland and Earl Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke, but did not wish for a public breach with their Whig colleagues. Burke wrote on 29 November 1790: &quot;I have received from the Duke of Portland, Lord Fitzwilliam, the Duke of Devonshire, Lord John Cavendish, Montagu (Frederick Montagu MP), and a long et cetera of the old Stamina of the Whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution&quot;.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed &quot;a considerable insight into human nature&quot; he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau &quot;entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity&quot;—which he &quot;was possessed to a degree little short of madness&quot;. He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of &quot;obscure and vulgar vices&quot; that was not &quot;chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action&quot;. Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: &quot;a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who asked Burke for more &quot;very refreshing mental food&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke release 'A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 1791</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which French philosopher did Burke attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Rousseau visit Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1766–7</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Rousseau stay with when visiting Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Hume</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>These events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox. In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was &quot;overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House&quot;. When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and &quot;the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man&quot;. Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions. Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by Lord Sheffield and seconded by Fox. Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Fox praised revolutionary principles in a debate about which country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of power did Fox think Burke was wrong about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hereditary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which constitution did Burke condemn on May 6, 1791?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Fox quoted Burke's speeches from how long ago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fourteen and fifteen years</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At this point, Fox whispered that there was &quot;no loss of friendship&quot;. &quot;I regret to say there is&quot;, Burke replied, &quot;I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend.

This provoked a reply from Fox, yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered &quot;unusually bitter sarcasms&quot;.

A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): &quot;It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform&quot;. He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: &quot;Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth&quot;. Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke receive a vote of thanks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 June 1794</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke's son die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 1794</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did King George III want to make Burke an Earl of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beaconsfield</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did Burke accept instead of the Earlship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£2,500</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who attacked Burke for receiving recognition from King George III?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Burke's last publications were the Letters on a Regicide Peace (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government.

This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture, Arthur Young; but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as, Thoughts and Details on Scarcity.

By March 1796, however Burke had changed his mind: &quot;Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism, and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal Government&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose ascendancy did Burke think was malignant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Burke call corporate tyranny in India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indianism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which continent did Jacobinism affect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burke decide Indianism was the worst threat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 1796</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Burke think was the worst threat in 1795?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jacobinism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Burke believed that property was essential to human life. Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence. As Christopher Hitchens summarises, &quot;If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Burke think was crucial for human life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">property</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Burke think a social hierarchy should be based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">property</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Burke think a social class structure benefited?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all subjects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote that Burke &quot;appealed to property owners&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christopher Hitchens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Hitchens think Burke supported preserving?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ancestral and the immemorial</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the nineteenth century Burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives. Burke's friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke &quot;was a man who truly &amp; prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles&quot; but because Burke wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments. William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had, when he had separated from Fox, and an observer said Windham spoke &quot;like the ghost of Burke&quot; when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801. William Hazlitt, a political opponent of Burke, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau), and made it &quot;a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke to be a great man&quot;. William Wordsworth was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in 'A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff' (1793), but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke. In his Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland Wordsworth called Burke &quot;the most sagacious Politician of his age&quot; whose predictions &quot;time has verified&quot;. He later revised his poem The Prelude to include praise of Burke (&quot;Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders&quot;) and portrayed him as an old oak. Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to have a similar conversion: he had criticised Burke in The Watchman, but in his Friend (1809–10) Coleridge defended Burke from charges of inconsistency. Later, in his Biographia Literaria (1817) Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring &quot;habitually to principles. He was a scientific statesman; and therefore a seer&quot;. Henry Brougham wrote of Burke: &quot;... all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity&quot;. George Canning believed that Burke's Reflections &quot;has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled&quot;. In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Burke's &quot;last works and words [as] the manual of my politics&quot;. The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli &quot;was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's later writings&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who thought Burke was prophetic about the French revolution's consequences?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip Francis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Francis think Burke's writing had too much of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">passion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made speeches very similar to Burke's in Parliament?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Windham</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Windham speak against peace with France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1801</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Wordsworth initially attack Burke?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1793</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke &quot;a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America&quot; and in his diary recorded: &quot;Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine&quot;. The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: &quot;I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton&quot;. The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved &quot;a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate.

This was Edmund Burke's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust. It was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright—freedom&quot;.
