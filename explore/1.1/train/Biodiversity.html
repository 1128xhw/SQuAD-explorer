One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species, and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term refers to  the variety and variability of life on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Biodiversity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of variations does Biodiversity refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of biodiversity happens near the equator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Terrestrial biodiversity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where on Earth is biodiversity the most abundnant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">It is richest in the tropics.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is sea surface temperature the highest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">along coasts in the Western Pacific</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This multilevel construct is consistent with Dasmann and Lovejoy. An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A.

Wilcox's definition was &quot;Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...&quot;. The 1992 United Nations Earth Summit defined &quot;biological diversity&quot; as &quot;the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems&quot;.

The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What model correlates much better than the hyperbolic model?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Phanerozoic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What model is widely used in macrosociology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hyperbolic model</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exponential and logistic models</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What model implies a second-order positive feedback?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hyperbolic model</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us choice in our diets.

If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity.

This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of biodiversity has the planet lost since 1970</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">52%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was they study done by the World Wildlife Fund?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">39%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage accounts for the marine wildlife gone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">39%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage accounts for the freshwater wildlife gone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">76%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species, and vice versa. &quot;If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down, and the community becomes dominated by a single species.&quot; At present, the most threatened ecosystems are found in fresh water, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005, which was confirmed by the &quot;Freshwater Animal Diversity Assessment&quot;, organised by the biodiversity platform, and the French Institut de recherche pour le développement (MNHNP).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year was the study published that found biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who conducted the 2007 study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Science Foundation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can cause a break down of a biodiversity system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">If any one type is removed from the system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the most threatened ecosystems found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in fresh water</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces.

Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, &quot;do invasive species cause extinctions?&quot; Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline, and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century started the increase of species invasions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1900s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who intentionally and unintentionally moves species around?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What invaders are causing changes in the Great Lakes region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What invaders are causing changes along the North American Atlantic coast?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lion fish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Brazil's Atlantic Forest is considered one such hotspot, containing roughly 20,000 plant species, 1,350 vertebrates, and millions of insects, about half of which occur nowhere else.[citation needed] The island of Madagascar and India are also particularly notable.

Until then the term &quot;natural diversity&quot; was common, introduced by The Science Division of The Nature Conservancy in an important 1975 study, &quot;The Preservation of Natural Diversity.&quot; By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins, Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of the term &quot;biological diversity&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scientist first used the term biological diversity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Raymond F.

A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market are derived from plants, animals, and micro-organisms, while about 80% of the world population depends on medicines from nature (used in either modern or traditional medical practice) for primary healthcare. Only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential. Biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of bionics. Evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the mid-1980s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration (&quot;bioprospecting&quot;) in favor of genomics and synthetic chemistry, indeed claims about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high cost of development; meanwhile, natural products have a long history of supporting significant economic and health innovation. Marine ecosystems are particularly important, although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss, as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Biodiversity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of US drugs are derived from plants, animals, and micro-organisms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at least 50%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What field has biodiversity made critical advances in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bionics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of worldwide drugs are derived from nature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 80%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In agriculture and animal husbandry, the Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution. This has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Green Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the high yield strains become resistant to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">local climate and diseases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who has been pushing for hybridization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Local governments and industry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the loss of biodiversity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
