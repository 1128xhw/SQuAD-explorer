The team has appeared in seven World Series following their 1908 title, most recently in 1945. The Cubs have not won the World Series in 107 years, the longest championship drought of any major North American professional sports team, and are often referred to as the &quot;Lovable Losers&quot; because of this distinction. They are also known as &quot;The North Siders&quot; because Wrigley Field, their home park since 1916, is located in Chicago's North Side Lake View community at 1060 West Addison Street.

The White Stockings played their home games at West Side Grounds,against the bloods and quickly established themselves as one of the new league's top teams.

The White Stockings, with Anson acting as player/manager, captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882, and Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. In 1885 and '86, after winning N.L. pennants, the White Stockings met the short-lived American Association champion in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in match ups with the St. Louis Brown Stockings, with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest rivalries in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, Chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by 1890 they had become known as the Chicago Colts, or sometimes &quot;Anson's Colts&quot;, referring to Cap's influence within the club. Anson was the first player in history credited with collecting 3,000 career hits. After a disappointing record of 59-73 and a 9th-place finish in 1897, Anson was released by the Cubs as both a player and manager. Due to Anson's absence from the club after 22 years, local newspaper reporters started to refer to the Cubs as the &quot;Orphans&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who assumed ownership of the Cubs after Hulbert died?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spalding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the White Stockings capture their third consecutive pennant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1882</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">While Anson led the Chicago cubs how many National League pennants did they win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Chicago Cubs become know as by 1890?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chicago Colts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first player in history credited with collecting 3,000 career hits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anson</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1902, Spalding, who by this time had revamped the roster to boast what would soon be one of the best teams of the early century, sold the club to Jim Hart. The franchise was nicknamed the Cubs by the Chicago Daily News in 1902, although not officially becoming the Chicago Cubs until the 1907 season. During this period, which has become known as baseball's dead-ball era, Cub infielders Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank Chance were made famous as a double-play combination by Franklin P. Adams' poem Baseball's Sad Lexicon. The poem first appeared in the July 18, 1910 edition of the New York Evening Mail. Mordecai &quot;Three-Finger&quot; Brown, Jack Taylor, Ed Reulbach, Jack Pfiester, and Orval Overall were several key pitchers for the Cubs during this time period. With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912, the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Although they fell to the &quot;Hitless Wonders&quot; White Sox in the 1906 World Series, the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the best winning percentage (.763) in Major League history. With mostly the same roster, Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, becoming the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic and the first to win it twice. However, the Cubs have not won a World Series since; this remains the longest championship drought in North American professional sports.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Spalding sell the Cubs to in 1902?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jim Hart</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who nicknamed the franchise the Cubs in 1902?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chicago Daily News</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who holds the longest championship drought in North American professional sports?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Cubs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the poem Baseball's Sad Lexicon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Franklin P.

Lasker brought in a wealthy partner, Charles Weeghman, the proprietor of a popular chain of lunch counters who had previously owned the Chicago Whales of the short-lived Federal League. As principal owners, the pair moved the club from the West Side Grounds to the much newer Weeghman Park, which had been constructed for the Whales only two years earlier, where they remain to this day. The Cubs responded by winning a pennant in the war-shortened season of 1918, where they played a part in another team's curse: the Boston Red Sox defeated Grover Cleveland Alexander's Cubs four games to two in the 1918 World Series, Boston's last Series championship until 2004.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who obtained a large block of the Cub's shares in 1914?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albert Lasker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who assumed majority ownership of the Cubs franchise by the 1916 season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albert Lasker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Albert Lasker bring in to be his partner of the Chicago Cubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Weeghman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Cubs move to after leaving the West Side Grounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Weeghman Park</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Near the end of the first decade of the double-Bills' guidance, the Cubs won the NL pennant in 1929 and then achieved the unusual feat of winning a pennant every three years, following up the 1929 flag with league titles in 1932, 1935, and 1938. Unfortunately, their success did not extend to the Fall Classic, as they fell to their AL rivals each time. The '32 series against the Yankees featured Babe Ruth's &quot;called shot&quot; at Wrigley Field in Game 3. There were some historic moments for the Cubs as well; In 1930, Hack Wilson, one of the top home run hitters in the game, had one of the most impressive seasons in MLB history, hitting 56 home runs and establishing the current runs-batted-in record of 191. That 1930 club, which boasted six eventual Hall of Famers (Wilson, Gabby Hartnett, Rogers Hornsby, George &quot;High Pockets&quot; Kelly, Kiki Cuyler and manager Joe McCarthy) established the current team batting average record of .309. In 1935 the Cubs claimed the pennant in thrilling fashion, winning a record 21 games in a row in September. The '38 club saw Dizzy Dean lead the team's pitching staff and provided a historic moment when they won a crucial late-season game at Wrigley Field over the Pittsburgh Pirates with a walk-off home run by Gabby Hartnett, which became known in baseball lore as &quot;The Homer in the Gloamin'&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Hack Wilson have one of the most impressive seasons in MLB history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1930</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many games in a row did the Cubs win in a row during 1935?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Cubs win the NL pennant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1929</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of World War II, finishing 98–56. Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games of the 1945 World Series were played in Detroit, where the Cubs won two games, including a one-hitter by Claude Passeau, and the final four were played at Wrigley. In Game 4 of the Series, the Curse of the Billy Goat was allegedly laid upon the Cubs when P.K. Wrigley ejected Billy Sianis, who had come to Game 4 with two box seat tickets, one for him and one for his goat. They paraded around for a few innings, but Wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to its unpleasant odor. Upon his ejection, Mr. Sianis uttered, &quot;The Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.&quot; The Cubs lost Game 4, lost the Series, and have not been back since. It has also been said by many that Sianis put a &quot;curse&quot; on the Cubs, apparently preventing the team from playing in the World Series. After losing the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, the Cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years, but those teams did not enter post-season play.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were the first three games of the 1945 World Series played in Detroit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wartime travel restrictions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the final four games of the 1945 World Series played?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wrigley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what game was the Curse of the Billy Goat allegedly laid upon the Cubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Game 4 of the Series</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was ejected from Wrigley park because of it's bad odor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">goat</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the following two decades after Sianis' ill will, the Cubs played mostly forgettable baseball, finishing among the worst teams in the National League on an almost annual basis. Longtime infielder/manager Phil Cavarretta, who had been a key player during the '45 season, was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above fifth place. Although shortstop Ernie Banks would become one of the star players in the league during the next decade, finding help for him proved a difficult task, as quality players such as Hank Sauer were few and far between. This, combined with poor ownership decisions such as the College of Coaches, and the ill-fated trade of future Hall of Famer Lou Brock to the Cardinals for pitcher Ernie Broglio (who won only 7 games over the next three seasons), hampered on-field performance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had been a key player in the 1945 season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phil Cavarretta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What season was Phil Cavarretta a key player for the Cubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the '45 season</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the Cubs were unlikely to finish above fifth place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phil Cavarretta</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1969 the Cubs, managed by Leo Durocher, built a substantial lead in the newly created National League Eastern Division by mid-August. Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game. The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a remarkable 17½ games in the standings to the Mets in the last quarter of the season.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who managed the Cubs in 1969?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leo Durocher</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Cubs built a substantial lead in what league under management of Leo Durocher?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National League Eastern Division</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Ken Hoitzman pitch a no-hitter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 19</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dick Selma</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the '69 season, the club posted winning records for the next few seasons, but no playoff action.

The Cubs hit a high-water mark on June 28 at 47–22, boasting an 8 1⁄2 game NL East lead, as they were led by Bobby Murcer (27 Hr/89 RBI), and Rick Reuschel (20–10). However, the Philadelphia Phillies cut the lead to two by the All-star break, as the Cubs sat 19 games over .500, but they swooned late in the season, going 20–40 after July 31. The Cubs finished in 4th place at 81–81, while Philadelphia surged, finishing with 101 wins. The following two seasons also saw the Cubs get off to a fast start, as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons, only to again wear down and play poorly later on, and ultimately settling back to mediocrity.

In fact, home field advantage had rotated between the winners of the East and West since 1969 when the league expanded. In even numbered years, the NL West had home field advantage.

Rumor was the Cubs could hold home games across town at Comiskey Park, home of the American League's Chicago White Sox. Rather than hold any games in the cross town rival Sox Park, the Cubs made arrangements with the August A. Busch, owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, to use Busch Stadium in St. Louis as the Cubs &quot;home field&quot; for the World Series. This was approved by Major League Baseball and would have enabled the Cubs to host games 1 and 2, along with games 6 and 7 if necessary. At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league. Odd numbered years the AL had home field advantage. Even numbered years the NL had home field advantage.

Afterward, Maddux would speak into his glove during any mound conversation, beginning what is a norm today. Mark Grace was 11–17 in the series with 8 RBI.

After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodríguez, known affectionately as &quot;H-Rod&quot; to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname &quot;Kid K,&quot; and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90–73 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town White Sox in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What legendary broadcaster died in the '98 season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harry Caray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was affectionately known as &quot;H-Rod&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry Rodríguez</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many round-trippers did Rodriguez slug in his first season in Chicago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">31</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite losing fan favorite Grace to free agency, and the lack of production from newcomer Todd Hundley, skipper Don Baylor's Cubs put together a good season in 2001.

Several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Luis Castillo. A Chicago Cubs fan by the name of Steve Bartman, of Northbrook, Illinois, reached for the ball and deflected it away from the glove of Moisés Alou for the second out of the 8th inning. Alou reacted angrily toward the stands, and after the game stated that he would have caught the ball. Alou at one point recanted, saying he would not have been able to make the play, but later said this was just an attempt to make Bartman feel better and believing the whole incident should be forgotten. Interference was not called on the play, as the ball was ruled to be on the spectator side of the wall. Castillo was eventually walked by Prior. Two batters later, and to the chagrin of the packed stadium, Cubs shortstop Alex Gonzalez misplayed an inning ending double play, loading the bases and leading to eight Florida runs and a Marlin victory.

The disappointing season also saw fans start to become frustrated with the constant injuries to ace pitchers Mark Prior and Kerry Wood. Additionally, the '04 season led to the departure of popular commentator Steve Stone, who had become increasingly critical of management during broadcasts and was verbally attacked by reliever Kent Mercker. Things were no better in 2005, despite a career year from first baseman Derrek Lee and the emergence of closer Ryan Dempster. The club struggled and suffered more key injuries, only managing to win 79 games after being picked by many to be a serious contender for the N.L. pennant.

Apparently handcuffed by the Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts family, the Cubs' quest for a NL Central 3-peat started with notice that there would be less invested into contracts than in previous years. Chicago engaged St. Louis in a see-saw battle for first place into August 2009, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 20–6 pace that month, designating their rivals to battle in the Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week. The Cubs were plagued by injuries in 2009, and were only able to field their Opening Day starting lineup three times the entire season. Third baseman Aramis Ramírez injured his throwing shoulder in an early May game against the Milwaukee Brewers, sidelining him until early July and forcing journeyman players like Mike Fontenot and Aaron Miles into more prominent roles. Additionally, key players like Derrek Lee (who still managed to hit .306 with 35 HR and 111 RBI that season), Alfonso Soriano and Geovany Soto also nursed nagging injuries. The Cubs posted a winning record (83–78) for the third consecutive season, the first time the club had done so since 1972, and a new era of ownership under the Ricketts' family was approved by MLB owners in early October.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Ricketts family acquire a majority interest in the Cubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Chicago engage in a see-saw battle for first place into August 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. Louis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What plagued the Cubs in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">injuries</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Rookie Starlin Castro debuted in early May (2010) as the starting shortstop.

Weeks after the season came to an end, the club was rejuvenated in the form of a new philosophy, as new owner Tom Ricketts signed Theo Epstein away from the Boston Red Sox, naming him club President and giving him a five-year contract worth over $18 million, and subsequently discharged manager Mike Quade. Epstein, a proponent of sabremetrics and one of the architects of two world series titles in Boston brought along Jed Hoyer to fill the role of GM and hired Dale Sveum as manager. Although the team had a dismal 2012 season, losing 101 games (the worst record since 1966) it was largely expected. The youth movement ushered in by Epstein and Hoyer began as longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired in May, followed by Ryan Dempster and Geovany Soto being traded to Texas at the All-Star break for a group of minor league prospects headlined by Christian Villanueva. The development of Castro, Anthony Rizzo, Darwin Barney, Brett Jackson and pitcher Jeff Samardzija as well as the replenishing of the minor-league system with prospects such as Javier Baez, Albert Almora, and Jorge Soler became the primary focus of the season, a philosophy which the new management said would carry over at least through the 2013 season.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many games under .500 did the Cubs finish the 2011 season with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the new owner of the Cubs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tom Ricketts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the new owner of the Cubs sign from the Boston Red Sox?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Theo Epstein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much was the contract given to Theo Epstein worth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$18 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The 2013 season resulted in much as the same the year before.

The mid season fire sale led to another last place finish in the NL Central, finishing with a record of 66-96.

On September 30, 2013, Theo Epstein made the decision to fire manager Dale Sveum after just two seasons at the helm of the Cubs.

The concept was for the players to have training and fitness before the start of the regular season. After the White Stockings had a successful season in 1886, winning the National League Pennant, other teams began bringing their players to &quot;spring training&quot;.  The Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Browns, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Spiders, Detroit Tigers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, New York Highlanders, Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Red Sox were among the early squads to arrive.

Many of those fans were, and are still, students at Chicago area colleges, such as DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern University, and Illinois-Chicago. A Broadway play, starring Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi ran for years and was based on a group of Cub fans who frequented the club's games.

Murphy alleges that Grousl started the Wrigley tradition of throwing back opposing teams' home run balls. The current group is headed by Derek Schaul (Derek the Five Dollar Kid). Prior to the 2006 season, they were updated, with new shops and private bar (The Batter's Eye) being added, and Bud Light bought naming rights to the bleacher section, dubbing them the Bud Light Bleachers.

Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cub player, explains columnist George Will, because &quot;He exemplified mediocrity under pressure, he was competent but obscure and typifying of the work ethics.&quot; Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed, but his ill feeling disappeared several years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan, also a society member, at the White House. Hillary Clinton, Jim Belushi, Joe Mantegna, Rahm Emanuel, Dick Cheney and many others have been included among its membership.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did a group of Chicago Cubs fans form the Emil Verban Society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1975</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the Emil Verban Society founders based in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Washington, D.C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who currently heads the Emil Verban Society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Illinois Senator Dick Durbin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the summer of 1969, a Chicago studio group produced a single record called &quot;Hey Hey! Holy Mackerel! (The Cubs Song)&quot; whose title and lyrics incorporated the catch-phrases of the respective TV and radio announcers for the Cubs, Jack Brickhouse and Vince Lloyd. Several members of the Cubs recorded an album called Cub Power which contained a cover of the song. The song received a good deal of local airplay that summer, associating it very strongly with that bittersweet season. It was played much less frequently thereafter, although it remained an unofficial Cubs theme song for some years after.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the single &quot;Hey Hey!
