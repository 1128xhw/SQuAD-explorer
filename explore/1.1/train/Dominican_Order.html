Membership in this &quot;mendicant&quot; order includes friars, nuns, active sisters, and lay or secular Dominicans (formerly known as tertiaries, though recently there has been a growing number of Associates, who are unrelated to the tertiaries) affiliated with the order.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Latin for Order of Preachers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ordo Praedicatorum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Pope approved of the Order of Preachers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pope Honorius III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the 15th century, what was the Order of Preachers known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dominican Order</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion does the Dominican Order belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Catholic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Spanish Priest founded the Order of Preachers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint Dominic de Guzman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Founded to preach the Gospel and to combat heresy, the teaching activity of the order and its scholastic organization placed the Preachers in the forefront of the intellectual life of the Middle Ages.

Men of God were no longer expected to stay behind the walls of a cloister. Instead, they travelled among the people, taking as their examples the apostles of the primitive Church. Out of this ideal emerged two orders of mendicant friars: one, the Friars Minor, was led by Francis of Assisi; the other, the Friars Preachers, by Dominic of Guzman. Like his contemporary, Francis, Dominic saw the need for a new type of organization, and the quick growth of the Dominicans and Franciscans during their first century of existence confirms that the orders of mendicant friars met a need.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Middle Ages, who was no longer expected to stay behind walls away from the common man?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Men of God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many orders of mendicant friars came out of the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Friars Minor order at this time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Francis of Assisi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dominic of Guzman led what order of mendicant friars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Friars Preachers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two groups grew quickly during the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dominicans and Franciscans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dominic sought to establish a new kind of order, one that would bring the dedication and systematic education of the older monastic orders like the Benedictines to bear on the religious problems of the burgeoning population of cities, but with more organizational flexibility than either monastic orders or the secular clergy. Dominic's new order was to be a preaching order, trained to preach in the vernacular languages. Rather than earning their living on vast farms as the monasteries had done, the new friars would survive by begging, &quot;selling&quot; themselves through persuasive preaching.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Dominican Order received influence from what monastic order?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Benedictines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of order was the Dominican Order?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a preaching order</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did previous religious orders do for a living?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">farms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Dominican Order earn money?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by begging</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dominic inspired his followers with loyalty to learning and virtue, a deep recognition of the spiritual power of worldly deprivation and the religious state, and a highly developed governmental structure.

The brethren of the Dominican Order were urban and learned, as well as contemplative and mystical in their spirituality. While these traits had an impact on the women of the order, the nuns especially absorbed the latter characteristics and made those characteristics their own. In England, the Dominican nuns blended these elements with the defining characteristics of English Dominican spirituality and created a spirituality and collective personality that set them apart.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Dominic inspire his followers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with loyalty to learning and virtue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group especially benefited from the Dominican Order's mystical spirituality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nuns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country did Dominican Order nuns thrive in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of spirituality did Dominic want his followers to learn?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a &quot;mixed&quot; spirituality</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As an adolescent, he had a particular love of theology and the Scriptures became the foundation of his spirituality.

On the other hand, the Cathars lived in a state of self-sacrifice that was widely appealing. For these reasons, Prior Diego suggested that the papal legates begin to live a reformed apostolic life. The legates agreed to change if they could find a strong leader. The prior took up the challenge, and he and Dominic dedicated themselves to the conversion of the Albigensians. Despite this particular mission, in winning the Albigensians over by persuasion Dominic met limited success, &quot;for though in his ten years of preaching a large number of converts were made, it has to be said that the results were not such as had been hoped for.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Prior Diego think the members of the Holy Church acted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with an offensive amount of pomp and ceremony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Prior Diego admire more than the Holy Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Cathars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Cathars live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in a state of self-sacrifice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In order to change to a better way of life, what did the legates request of Diego?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a strong leader</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Diego and Dominic try to convert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Albigensians</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dominic became the spiritual father to several Albigensian women he had reconciled to the faith, and in 1206 he established them in a convent in Prouille.

Prior Diego sanctioned the building of a monastery for girls whose parents had sent them to the care of the Albigensians because their families were too poor to fulfill their basic needs. The monastery was at Prouille would later become Dominic's headquarters for his missionary effort there. After two years on the mission field, Prior Diego died while traveling back to Spain.

Its purpose was revolutionary in the pastoral ministry of the Catholic Church. These priests were organized and well trained in religious studies. Dominic needed a framework—a rule—to organize these components. The Rule of St. Augustine was an obvious choice for the Dominican Order, according to Dominic's successor, Jordan of Saxony, because it lent itself to the &quot;salvation of souls through preaching&quot;. By this choice, however, the Dominican brothers designated themselves not monks, but canons-regular.

With charity, the other concept that most defines the work and spirituality of the order, study became the method most used by the Dominicans in working to defend the Church against the perils that hounded it, and also of enlarging its authority over larger areas of the known world. In Dominic's thinking, it was impossible for men to preach what they did not or could not understand. When the brethren left Prouille, then, to begin their apostolic work, Dominic sent Matthew of Paris to establish a school near the University of Paris.

In May 1220 at Bologna the order's first General Chapter mandated that each new priory of the order maintain its own studium conventuale thus laying the foundation of the Dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its studium conventuale occurred with the legal transfer of property from Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on June 5, 1222. This studium was transformed into the order's first studium provinciale by Saint Thomas Aquinas in 1265. Part of the curriculum of this studium was relocated in 1288 at the studium of Santa Maria sopra Minerva which in the 16th century world be transformed into the College of Saint Thomas (Latin: Collegium Divi Thomæ).

It assumed remarkable proportions in the congregations of Lombardy and the Netherlands, and in the reforms of Savonarola in Florence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The term &quot;Dominican mysticism&quot; is also knows as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German mysticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what European countries did the Dominican Order experience changes to how they thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany and Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What saint is associated with the new Dominican mysticism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. Catherine of Siena</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dominican mysticism also spread to what European country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Netherlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What friar helped to spread Dominican mysticism to Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Savonarola</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the same time the order found itself face to face with the Renaissance.

He took the habit of a Friar Preacher at Rome (1839), and the province of France was canonically erected in 1850. From this province were detached the province of Lyon, called Occitania (1862), that of Toulouse (1869), and that of Canada (1909). The French restoration likewise furnished many laborers to other provinces, to assist in their organization and progress. From it came the master general who remained longest at the head of the administration during the 19th century, Père Vincent Jandel (1850–1872). Here should be mentioned the province of St. Joseph in the United States. Founded in 1805 by Edward Fenwick, afterwards first Bishop of Cincinnati, Ohio (1821–1832), this province has developed slowly, but now ranks among the most flourishing and active provinces of the order. In 1910 it numbered seventeen convents or secondary houses. In 1905, it established a large house of studies at Washington, D.C., called the Dominican House of Studies.

Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection. The contemplative then knows that God is, but she does not know what God is. Thus, contemplation forever produces a mystified, imperfect knowledge of God. The soul is exalted beyond the rest of God's creation but it cannot see God Himself.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What enhances man's faith in God according to Albertus Magnus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wisdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a tool that God uses to speak to the average man?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">understanding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can man obtain understanding of God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Contemplation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If someone contemplates God forever, what type of knowledge will they obtain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">imperfect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cannot see God itself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The soul</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the image of God grows within man, he learns to rely less on an intellectual pursuit of virtue and more on an affective pursuit of charity and meekness.

There were seventy-four Dominican female houses in Germany, forty-two in Italy, nine in France, eight in Spain, six in Bohemia, three in Hungary, and three in Poland. Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as Beguines, that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There were one hundred and fifty-seven nunneries in the order by 1358.

This type of mysticism carried with it four elements. First, spiritually it emulated the moral essence of Christ's life. Second, there was a connection linking moral emulation of Christ's life and humanity's disposition as images of the divine.

As their love and knowledge of God grows and is sanctified by faith and experience, the image of God within man becomes ever more bright and clear.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is man always seen as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an image of God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the English Dominicans like to concentrate on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">moral implications of image-bearing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What amends humanity to God's life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The process of Christ's life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The idea of the image of God allows man to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">move toward God</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
