During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research. The first dedicated systems started to appear in the market as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world. One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from PictureTel Corp., which had an Initial Public Offering in November, 1984.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade was digital telephony transmission made possible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the minimum bit rate for compressed video and audio transmission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">128 kilobits/s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of an early form of digital video and audio communication?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Media space</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what form did the first dedicated videoconferencing system appear as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ISDN networks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company offered the first commercial videoconferencing system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PictureTel Corp.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane, which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation, endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls.

Such students are able to explore, communicate, analyze and share information and ideas with one another. Through videoconferencing, students can visit other parts of the world to speak with their peers, and visit museums and educational facilities. Such virtual field trips can provide enriched learning opportunities to students, especially those in geographically isolated locations, and to the economically disadvantaged.

Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony. The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services in the 1990s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company introduced the first device to help deaf people communicate through telecommunications?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AT&amp;T</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of AT&amp;T's videophone device?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Picturephone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was AT&amp;T's &quot;Picturephone&quot; device introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1964</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was AT&amp;T's &quot;Picturephone&quot; device unveiled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1964 New York World's Fair</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade were more efficient ways of using sign language via video-telephony developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the increasingly globalized film industry, videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production.

At the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Nagano, Japan, Seiji Ozawa conducted the Ode to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony simultaneously across five continents in near-real time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what decade was Internet video-conferencing made possible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what device was videoconferencing finally able to be used in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">desktop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was CU-SeeMe, a desktop-based videoconferencing tool, developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the first public video-conference take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1995</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What South African city participated in the first public video-conference?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cape Town</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The core technology used in a videoconferencing system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time. The hardware or software that performs compression is called a codec (coder/decoder). Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved. The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled packets, which are then transmitted through a digital network of some kind (usually ISDN or IP). The use of audio modems in the transmission line allow for the use of POTS, or the Plain Old Telephone System, in some low-speed applications, such as videotelephony, because they convert the digital pulses to/from analog waves in the audio spectrum range.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the software that performs audio and/or video compression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a codec (coder/decoder)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How high can compression rates go?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1:500</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one digital network through which a digital stream can be transmitted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">IP</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does POTS stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Plain Old Telephone System</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do POTS do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">convert the digital pulses to/from analog waves</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Typical use of the various technologies described above include calling or conferencing on a one-on-one, one-to-many or many-to-many basis for personal, business, educational, deaf Video Relay Service and tele-medical, diagnostic and rehabilitative use or services.

With videoconferencing, patients may contact nurses and physicians in emergency or routine situations; physicians and other paramedical professionals can discuss cases across large distances. Rural areas can use this technology for diagnostic purposes, thus saving lives and making more efficient use of health care money. For example, a rural medical center in Ohio, United States, used videoconferencing to successfully cut the number of transfers of sick infants to a hospital 70 miles (110 km) away. This had previously cost nearly $10,000 per transfer.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one way that videoconferencing is useful?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">real-time telemedicine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What areas benefit especially from videoconferencing? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rural</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what US state did a rural area use videoconferencing to help reduce the number of transfers of sick infants to hospitals? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ohio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far away was the hospital from this rural area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70 miles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did videoconferencing help this rural area save?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$10,000 per transfer</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>VRS services have become well developed nationally in Sweden since 1997 and also in the United States since the first decade of the 2000s.

These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as &quot;decentralized multipoint&quot;, where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central &quot;manager&quot; or other bottleneck. The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they don't have to be relayed through a central point. Also, users can make ad-hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU. This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth, because every station must transmit to every other station directly.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do systems with no MCU use in order to perform multipoint conferencing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a standards-based H.323 technique</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one advantage of using an H.323 technique?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">higher quality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one disadvantage of using the H.323 technique?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increased network bandwidth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the H.323 technique also known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decentralized multipoint</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the video and audio of the H.323 technique higher quality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they don't have to be relayed through a central point</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA), which oversees the world's largest administrative judicial system under its Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR), has made extensive use of videoconferencing to conduct hearings at remote locations.
