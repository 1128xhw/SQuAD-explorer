sexual orientation, but they are distinguished, with sexual identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and orientation referring to &quot;fantasies, attachments and longings.&quot; Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors. People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as 'closeted'. The term may, however, reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities. In studies related to sexual orientation, when dealing with the degree to which a person's sexual attractions, behaviors and identity match, scientists usually use the terms concordance or discordance. Thus, a woman who is attracted to other women, but calls herself heterosexual and only has sexual relations with men, can be said to experience discordance between her sexual orientation (homosexual or lesbian) and her sexual identity and behaviors (heterosexual).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is sexual identity defined as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individual's conception of themselves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is sexual behavior defined as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">actual sexual acts performed by the individual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the term closeted mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the terms related to the degree to which a person's sexual attractions, behavior and identity match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">concordance or discordance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is sexual orientation defined as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fantasies, attachments and longings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the differences in sexual identity and sexual behaviour? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sexual identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does a person have to show their sexual oreintation in their personal acts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a term that can be used for someone who does not show their homosexuality openly? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">closeted</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word is used when somebodys sexual orientation, behaviors, and idenity do not match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">discordance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which word is used when somebodys sexual orientation, behaviors, and idenity match?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">concordance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gay and lesbian people can have sexual relationships with someone of the opposite sex for a variety of reasons, including the desire for a perceived traditional family and concerns of discrimination and religious ostracism.

Research in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity found that concepts of masculinity and femininity are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum, with each end representing opposite extremes. When compared on the same scale, they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa. However, if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine. Similarly, considering heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either. When they are measured independently, the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined, rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual as determined using the Kinsey Scale.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a concern of the Kinsey scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are masculinity and femininity more appropriately measured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as independent concepts on a separate scale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens if the concepts are measured on the same scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the advantage of measuring these elements separately?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined, rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is considered to be a problem with the Kinsey scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the research performed in the 1970s show about masculinity and feminity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would be possible if homesexuality and heterosexuality where measured on different scales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another benefit of measuring sexuality on two scaless verses just the Kinsey scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Research focusing on sexual orientation uses scales of assessment to identify who belongs in which sexual population group.

Knowing how much of the population is made up of homosexual individuals influences how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies. For example, if homosexual individuals constitute only 1% of the general population they are politically easier to ignore or than if they are known to be a constituency that surpasses most ethnic and ad minority groups. If the number is relatively minor then it is difficult to argue for community based same sex programs and services, mass media inclusion of gay role models, or Gay/Straight Alliances in schools. For this reason, in the 1970s Bruce Voeller, the chair of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force perpetuated a common myth that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population by averaging a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women. Voeller generalized this finding and used it as part of the modern gay rights movement to convince politicians and the public that &quot;we [gays and lesbians] are everywhere&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What myth did Bruce Voeller perpetuate in the 70's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the calculations of this myth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">averaging a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What message did Voeller deliver using this myth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">we [gays and lesbians] are everywhere</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What comes along with defining how much of the population is homosexual?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">influences how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does knowing the sexual population influence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the cahir of the national gay and lesbian task force in the 1970s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bruce Voeller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Bruce Voeller do with his findings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">used it as part of the modern gay rights movement to convince politicians and the public that &quot;we [gays and lesbians] are everywhere&quot;.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What myth did Bruce Voeller preserve in the 1970s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population by averaging a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another study on men and women's patterns of sexual arousal confirmed that men and women have different patterns of arousal, independent of their sexual orientations.

The meaning of words referencing categories of sexual orientation are negotiated in the mass media in relation to social organization. New words may be brought into use to describe new terms or better describe complex interpretations of sexual orientation. Other words may pick up new layers or meaning.

For example, it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa. This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud, as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through the second half of the twentieth century, gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations. An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous, and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the &quot;gender-conforming heterosexual&quot; and the &quot;gender-nonconforming homosexual&quot; as negative stereotypes. Nevertheless, studies by J. Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Early writers linked orientation to what concept?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the subject's own sex</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What theorists agreed with this concept?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two things became to be seen as distinct from one another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What negative stereotypes have emerged from this understanding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gender-conforming heterosexual&quot; and the &quot;gender-nonconforming homosexual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a majority of gay men and women experience in their childhood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gender-nonconformity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did gender idenity become to be seen as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be considered to be bad stereotypes to gay communities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;gender-conforming heterosexual&quot; and the &quot;gender-nonconforming homosexual&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who performed the studies that found most homosexual people having different degrees of gender issues?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was thought of early lesbians and gay men?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In these studies when was the gender-noncomformity experienced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">during their childhood years.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the United States, non-Caucasian LGBT individuals may find themselves in a double minority, where they are neither fully accepted or understood by mainly Caucasian LGBT communities, nor are they accepted by their own ethnic group.

Because of the limited populations that each component captures, consumers of research should be cautious in generalizing these findings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are the three component used to determine sexual orientation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all three are used independently and provide different conclusions regarding sexual orientation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Savin WIlliams talk about the issues with these components?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">(2006)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What issues to Savin address during this talk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">basing findings regarding sexual orientation on a single component, researchers may not actually capture the intended population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why does basing sexual orientation on one component cause problems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Because of the limited populations that each component captures</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How should consumers of the research approach these findings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">should be cautious in generalizing these findings.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>More recently, scientists have started to focus on measuring changes in brain activity related to sexual arousal, by using brain-scanning techniques.

Kinsey reported that when the individuals' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed, most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual — i.e., most people have some attraction to either sex, although usually one sex is preferred. According to Kinsey, only a minority (5–10%) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual.[citation needed] Conversely, only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual (with an equal attraction to both sexes). Kinsey's methods have been criticized as flawed, particularly with regard to the randomness of his sample population, which included prison inmates, male prostitutes and those who willingly participated in discussion of previously taboo sexual topics. Nevertheless, Paul Gebhard, subsequent director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, reexamined the data in the Kinsey Reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and prostitutes barely affected the results.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two studies where created by Alfred C.

Androphilia and gynephilia are terms used in behavioral science to describe sexual orientation as an alternative to a gender binary conceptualization. Androphilia describes sexual attraction to masculinity; gynephilia describes the sexual attraction to femininity. The term sexual preference largely overlaps with sexual orientation, but is generally distinguished in psychological research. A person who identifies as bisexual, for example, may sexually prefer one sex over the other.

The classification scheme, which was meant only to describe males, separated them into three basic categories: dionings, urnings and uranodionings. An urning can be further categorized by degree of effeminacy. These categories directly correspond with the categories of sexual orientation used today: heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual. In the series of pamphlets, Ulrichs outlined a set of questions to determine if a man was an urning.

Valuable information was lost by collapsing the two values into one final score. A person who has only predominantly same sex reactions is different from someone with relatively little reaction but lots of same sex experience. It would have been quite simple for Kinsey to have measured the two dimensions separately and report scores independently to avoid loss of information.

Furthermore, sexuality is fluid such that one's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life. Diamond (2003) found that over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once, with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings. Furthermore, women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour. One woman stated &quot;I'm mainly straight but I'm one of those people who, if the right circumstance came along, would change my viewpoint&quot;. Therefore, individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What reflects the prevalence rates varying?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">people's inconsistent responses to the different components of sexual orientation within a study and the instability of their responses over time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does it mean when someones sexualiity is fluid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">such that one's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Diamond find about the women?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did women acknowledge who considered themselves as lesbian or bisexual?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes it difficult to determine if someone is homosexual or not?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because sexual orientation is complex and multi-dimensional, some academics and researchers, especially in queer studies, have argued that it is a historical and social construction.

Social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation. Influences of culture may complicate the process of measuring sexual orientation. The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples, however there are pockets of research that document various other cultural groups, although these are frequently limited in diversity of gender and sexual orientation of the subjects. Integration of sexual orientation with sociocultural identity may be a challenge for LGBT individuals. Individuals may or may not consider their sexual orientation to define their sexual identity, as they may experience various degrees of fluidity of sexuality, or may simply identify more strongly with another aspect of their identity such as family role. American culture puts a great emphasis on individual attributes, and views the self as unchangeable and constant. In contrast, East Asian cultures put a great emphasis on a person's social role within social hierarchies, and view the self as fluid and malleable.

As a result of this immune effect, alterations in later-born males' prenatal development have been thought to occur. This process, known as the maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH), would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment.

There is &quot;little coherent relationship between the amount and mix of homosexual and heterosexual behavior in a person's biography and that person's choice to label himself or herself as bisexual, homosexual, or heterosexual&quot;. Individuals typically experience diverse attractions and behaviors that may reflect curiosity, experimentation, social pressure and is not necessarily indicative of an underlying sexual orientation. For example, a woman may have fantasies or thoughts about sex with other women but never act on these thoughts and only have sex with opposite gender partners. If sexual orientation was being assessed based on one's sexual attraction then this individual would be considered homosexual, but her behavior indicates heterosexuality.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are sexual attraction. behavior, and idenity components of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sexual orientation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do individuals typically experience?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diverse attractions and behaviors that may reflect curiosity, experimentation, social pressure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is there little coherent relationships between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the amount and mix of homosexual and heterosexual behavior in a person's biography and that person's choice to label himself</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the paper &quot;Who's Gay?

He first suggests that greater priority should be given to sexual arousal and attraction over behaviour and identity because it is less prone to self- and other-deception, social conditions and variable meanings. To measure attraction and arousal he proposed that biological measures should be developed and used. There are numerous biological/physiological measures that exist that can measure sexual orientation such as sexual arousal, brain scans, eye tracking, body odour preference, and anatomical variations such as digit-length ratio and right or left handedness. Secondly, Savin-Williams suggests that researchers should forsake the general notion of sexual orientation altogether and assess only those components that are relevant for the research question being investigated.

Sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, behavior, identity), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do these studies suggest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is this reflected in the studies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some dimensions of sexual orientation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">attractions, behavior, identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do mens sexual orientations tend be focused on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">physical component of attractions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do researches believe must be taken into account for women in these studies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emotional attachment</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One person may presume knowledge of another person's sexual orientation based upon perceived characteristics, such as appearance, clothing, tone of voice, and accompaniment by and behavior with other people.
