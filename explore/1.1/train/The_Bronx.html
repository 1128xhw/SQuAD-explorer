He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem (on Manhattan island), and bought additional tracts from the local tribes. He eventually accumulated 500 acres (about 2 square km, or 3/4 of a square mile) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung, which became known as Bronck's River, or The Bronx.

The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers.

The Herculoids, made up of Herc, Coke La Rock, and DJ Clark Kent, were the earliest to gain major fame. The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as &quot;The Boogie Down Bronx&quot;, or just &quot;The Boogie Down&quot;.

The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series, when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like, &quot;There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning&quot;. Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.

In the 1979 film The Warriors, the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn. A Bronx Tale (1993) depicts gang activities in the Belmont &quot;Little Italy&quot; section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and &quot;Gunhill&quot; (a play off the name Gun Hill Road). This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning, an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series (2007) about the New York Yankees' drive to winning baseball's 1977 World Series.

A 1973 Yorkshire Television documentary and &quot;A Kind of Alaska&quot;, a 1985 play by Harold Pinter, were also based on Sacks' book.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did &quot;Awakenings&quot; come out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose real story is 'Awakenings' based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oliver Sacks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Sacks' career?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neurologist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was 'A Kind of Alaska' performed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'A Kind of Alaska'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harold Pinter</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in Herman Wouk's City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. Kate Simon's Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue. In Jacob M. Appel's short story, &quot;The Grand Concourse&quot; (2007), a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in Avery Corman's book The Old Neighborhood (1980), an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood (Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was 'City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder' published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1948</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of 'City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder' is set in the Bronx?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about half</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Herman Wouk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was 'The Grand Concourse' published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'The Grand Concourse'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jacob M.

A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, the New York Times reported that &quot;the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.&quot; In the same article, the Reverend Al Sharpton (whose fictional analogue in the novel is &quot;Reverend Bacon&quot;) asserts that &quot;twenty years later, the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe's wardrobe.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'Bonfire of the Vanities'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tom Wolfe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was 'Bonfire of the Vanities' published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1987</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the main character of 'Bonfire of the Vanities'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sherman McCoy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What race was Sherman McCoy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">white</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did McCoy get lost?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
