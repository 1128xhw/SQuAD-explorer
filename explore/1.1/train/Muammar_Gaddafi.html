Founding a revolutionary cell within the military, in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic. Ruling by decree, he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments. Intent on pushing Libya towards &quot;Islamic socialism&quot;, he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973 he initiated a &quot;Popular Revolution&quot; with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in The Green Book.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book did Gaddafi publish that detailed his Third Internal Theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Green Book</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Gaddafi's first position in government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As Chairman of the RCC, list the first two things that Gaddafi accomplished.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Gaddafi change the legal system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Describe the Popular Revolution.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Gaddafi change the legal system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Gaddafi use all the money that resulted from nationalizing the oil industry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to bolster the military, implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Describe the Popular Revolution.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Gaddafi established his power in the government, what were his first actions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What political ideology did Gaddafi want to push his country to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islamic socialism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the profession of Gaddafi's father?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">goat herder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Gaddafi's ethnicity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bedouin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city was the Royal Military Academy located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benghazi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what monarch did Gaddafi's movement take over Libya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Idris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the governing body headed by Gaddafi after the revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Revolutionary Command Council</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state, the Jamahiriya (&quot;state of the masses&quot;). Officially adopting a symbolic role in governance, he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents. Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing led to Libya's label of &quot;international pariah&quot;. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions. Rejecting his earlier ideological commitments, from 1999 Gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with Western nations, also embracing Pan-Africanism and helping to establish the African Union. Amid the Arab Spring, in 2011 an anti-Gaddafist uprising led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) broke out, resulting in the Libyan Civil War. NATO intervened militarily on the side of the NTC, bringing about the government's downfall. Retreating to Sirte, Gaddafi was captured and killed by NTC militants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">state of the masses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Gaddafi's role in jamahiriya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">List two reasons why Libya become an &quot;international pariah.&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name two significant events in 1986 that demonstrated the world's view of Libya.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Gaddafi lose power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">uprising led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) broke out, resulting in the Libyan Civil War.

His family came from a small, relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985), and his mother was named Aisha (died 1978); Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder. Nomadic Bedouins, they were illiterate and kept no birth records. As such, Gaddafi's date of birth is not known with certainty, and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943, although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940. His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life.

At World War II's end in 1945, Libya was occupied by British and French forces. Although Britain and France intended on dividing the nation between their empires, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) declared that the country be granted political independence.

Subsequently moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years. Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents.

The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963.

Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup.

Such attempts to form a working relationship with the RCC failed; Gaddafi was determined to reassert national sovereignty and expunge what he described as foreign colonial and imperialist influences. His administration insisted that the U.S. and U.K. remove their military bases from Libya, with Gaddafi proclaiming that &quot;the armed forces which rose to express the people's revolution [will not] tolerate living in their shacks while the bases of imperialism exist in Libyan territory.&quot; The British left in March and the Americans in June 1970.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nations comprised the Four Powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who told Gaddafi about a possible counter-coup in 1970?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the U.S., what major power recognized Gaddafi's government at an early date?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.K.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what month and year did the United States remove its military bases from Libya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who removed their Libyan military bases in March of 1970?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Moving to reduce Italian influence, in October 1970 all Italian-owned assets were expropriated and the 12,000-strong Italian community expelled from Libya alongside a smaller number of Jews.

Gaddafi proclaimed that the People's Congresses provided for Libya's every political need, rendering other political organizations unnecessary; all non-authorized groups, including political parties, professional associations, independent trade unions and women's groups, were banned.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the GPC accused of being vis-à-vis Gaddafi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a rubber stamp</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What policy did Gaddafi propose that the GPC was against?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">primary schools to be abolished</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of education did Gaddafi prefer to primary schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">home schooling</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a policy that Gaddafi instituted without support from the GPC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allow women into the armed forces</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With preceding legal institutions abolished, Gaddafi envisioned the Jamahiriya as following the Qur'an for legal guidance, adopting sharia law; he proclaimed &quot;man-made&quot; laws unnatural and dictatorial, only permitting Allah's law.

His emphasis on placing his own work on a par with the Qur'an led conservative clerics to accuse him of shirk, furthering their opposition to his regime. In July, a border war broke out with Egypt, in which the Egyptians defeated Libya despite their technological inferiority.

In February 1978, Gaddafi discovered that his head of military intelligence was plotting to kill him, and began to increasingly entrust security to his Qaddadfa tribe. Many who had seen their wealth and property confiscated turned against the administration, and a number of western-funded opposition groups were founded by exiles. Most prominent was the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), founded in 1981 by Mohammed Magariaf, which orchestrated militant attacks against Libya's government, while another, al-Borkan, began killing Libyan diplomats abroad. Following Gaddafi's command to kill these &quot;stray dogs&quot;, under Colonel Younis Bilgasim's leadership, the Revolutionary Committees set up overseas branches to suppress counter-revolutionary activity, assassinating various dissidents. Although nearby nations like Syria also used hit squads, Gaddafi was unusual in publicly bragging about his administration's use of them; in June 1980, he ordered all dissidents to return home or be &quot;liquidated wherever you are.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What tribe did Gaddafi belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Qaddadfa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Libyan government official allegedly plotted to kill Gaddafi in 1978?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">head of military intelligence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1981, what Libyan opposition group was founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Front for the Salvation of Libya</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the NFSL?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mohammed Magariaf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group notably murdered Libyan diplomats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">al-Borkan,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1979, the U.S. placed Libya on its list of &quot;State Sponsors of Terrorism&quot;, while at the end of the year a demonstration torched the U.S. embassy in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis. The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What list did the United States add Libya to in 1979?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">State Sponsors of Terrorism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what Libyan city was the United States embassy burned in 1979?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tripoli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event prompted the burning of the US embassy in Libya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iran hostage crisis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did Syria owe to the Soviets as of 1980?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">£1 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country's military was attacking Uganda in 1979?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tanzanian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on &quot;Gaddafi's Pet Project&quot;, the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a joint NFSL–Muslim Brotherhood militia, and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did Libya earn from oil in 1986?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$5.4 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was another name for the Great Man-Made River?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gaddafi's Pet Project</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country did FROLINAT operate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Libyan military pull out of Chad at the behest of the OAU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1981</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the ruler of Morocco in 1984?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hassan II</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan pursued a hard line approach to Libya, erroneously considering it a puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed as a part of its territorial waters – in August 1981 the U.S. shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised U.S. companies operating in the country to reduce the number of American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the U.S. implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all U.S. companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the U.K., after Libyan diplomats were accused in the shooting death of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the U.S. Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the U.S. sank several Libyan ships.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what years did Gaddafi visit the Soviet Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1981 and 1985</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Reagan wrongly believe Libya to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a puppet regime of the Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As a result of American hostility, what military alliance did Libya say it would join?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Warsaw Pact</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Libyan aircraft were shot down by the United States in 1981?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Su-22</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the occupation of Yvonne Fletcher?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">policewoman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the U.S. accused Libya of orchestrating the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, in which two American soldiers died, Reagan decided to retaliate militarily.

In Operation El Dorado Canyon, orchestrated on 15 April 1986, U.S. military planes launched a series of air-strikes on Libya, bombing military installations in various parts of the country, killing around 100 Libyans, including several civilians. One of the targets had been Gaddafi's home. Himself unharmed, two of Gaddafi's sons were injured, and he claimed that his four-year-old adopted daughter Hanna was killed, although her existence has since been questioned.  In the immediate aftermath, Gaddafi retreated to the desert to meditate, while there were sporadic clashes between Gaddafists and army officers who wanted to overthrow the government. Although the U.S. was condemned internationally, Reagan received a popularity boost at home. Publicly lambasting U.S. imperialism, Gaddafi's reputation as an anti-imperialist was strengthened both domestically and across the Arab world, and in June 1986, he ordered the names of the month to be changed in Libya.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many Libyans died in Operation El Dorado Canyon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What terrorist attack did the United States claim Libya supported?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1986 Berlin discotheque bombing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Americans died in the Berlin disco bombing of 1986?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Gaddafi's daughter who may not have existed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hanna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did the CIA believe Reagan should attack instead of Libya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Syria</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The late 1980s saw a series of liberalising economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues. In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the &quot;Revolution within a Revolution&quot;, which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business. Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticised them, asserting that &quot;they deviated, harmed, tortured&quot; and that &quot;the true revolutionary does not practise repression.&quot; In March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive. Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the &quot;Revolution within a Revolution&quot; begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1987</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many articles were contained in the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">27</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who won the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights in 1989?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nelson Mandela</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Mandela's nationality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South African</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the aftermath of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalised army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bodies were intended to be replaced by the popular militia created in 1988?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">army and police</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Libya manufacture mustard gas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rabta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What chemical weapon did Libya start making in 1987?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mustard gas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did an abortive coup occur in 1993?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Misrata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did a Muslim insurgency take place in 1995?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benghazi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the foundation of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the west when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticising them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, who was a founding member of the Arab Maghreb Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mauritania</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who was suspected of the attack on Pan Am Flight 103?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abdelbaset al-Megrahi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people not on Pan Am Flight 103 were killed by its destruction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 1992 UN Resolution imposed sanctions on Libya for its refusal to hand over the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing suspects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">748</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the value of the economic losses experienced by Libya as a result of Resolution 748?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$900 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the 20th century came to a close, Gaddafi increasingly rejected Arab nationalism, frustrated by the failure of his Pan-Arab ideals; instead he turned to Pan-Africanism, emphasising Libya's African identity. From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he proclaimed that African states should reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki. At the third AU summit, held in Libya in July 2005, he called for a greater level of integration, advocating a single AU passport, a common defence system and a single currency, utilising the slogan: &quot;The United States of Africa is the hope.&quot; In June 2005, Libya joined the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and in August 2008 Gaddafi was proclaimed &quot;King of Kings&quot; by an assembled committee of traditional African leaders. On 1 February 2009, his &quot;coronation ceremony&quot; was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, coinciding with Gaddafi's election as AU chairman for a year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization did Libya join in 1999?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Community of Sahel-Saharan States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the OAU summit in July 1999 occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Algiers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization was founded in July of 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is COMESA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the president of South Africa circa 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thabo Mbeki</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The era saw Libya's return to the international arena. In 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to normalise relations. In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. The following month, Gaddafi travelled to the headquarters of the European Union (EU) in Brussels, signifying improved relations between Libya and the EU, the latter ending its remaining sanctions in October. In October 2010, the EU paid Libya €50 million to stop African migrants passing into Europe; Gaddafi encouraged the move, saying that it was necessary to prevent the loss of European cultural identity to a new &quot;Black Europe&quot;. Removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2006, Gaddafi nevertheless continued his anti-western rhetoric, and at the Second Africa-South America Summit in Venezuela in September 2009, joined Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in calling for an &quot;anti-imperialist&quot; front across Africa and Latin America. Gaddafi proposed the establishment of a South Atlantic Treaty Organization to rival NATO. That month he also addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time, using it to condemn &quot;western aggression&quot;. In Spring 2010, Gaddafi proclaimed jihad against Switzerland after Swiss police accused two of his family members of criminal activity in the country, resulting in the breakdown of bilateral relations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What world leader notably visited Libya in 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jiang Zemin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What conflict prompted Libya to end its nuclear weapons program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iraq War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What world leader visited Gaddafi in 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tony Blair</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city is the EU headquarters located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brussels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did Libya receive to stem the flow of African migrants into Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">€50 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging &quot;people's socialism&quot; rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what month and year did Gaddafi make a speech promoting economic privatization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much direct foreign investment existed in Libya circa 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$40 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what factor did direct foreign investment in Libya increase between 2003 and 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sixfold</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to the plan of 2010, what fraction of Libya's economy was intended to be privatized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">half</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of October 2009, who was the head of the PSLC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then threatened by the Tunisian Revolution.

Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventative measures, reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors and releasing several Islamist prisoners. They proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogenous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30%.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the so-called Arab Spring occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the president of Tunisia in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zine El Abidine Ben Ali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About what percentage of the Libyan population was unemployed in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date in 2011 did protests begin in Libya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 February</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with corruption, what were Libyans upset with in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">patronage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Accusing the rebels of being &quot;drugged&quot; and linked to al-Qaeda, Gaddafi proclaimed that he would die a martyr rather than leave Libya.

Shocked at the government's response, a number of senior politicians resigned or defected to the protesters' side. The uprising spread quickly through Libya's less economically developed eastern half.

In March, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation.

Libya's chief forensic pathologist, Dr. Othman al-Zintani, carried out the autopsies of Gaddafi, his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths; although the pathologist initially told the press that Gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head, the autopsy report was not made public.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who claimed to have murdered Gaddafi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Senad el-Sadik el-Ureybi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What son of Gaddafi, present in the convoy, was found dead shortly after being captured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mutassim</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did an ambulance take Gaddafi after he was murdered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Misrata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the chief forensic pathologist of Libya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dr. Othman al-Zintani</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bodies of Gaddafi supporters were found at the Mahari Hotel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">66</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On the afternoon of Gaddafi's death, NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril publicly revealed the news.

During the early 1970s, Gaddafi formulated his own particular approach to Arab nationalism and socialism, known as Third International Theory, which has been described as a combination of &quot;utopian socialism, Arab nationalism, and the Third World revolutionary theory that was in vogue at the time&quot;. He laid out the principles of this Theory in the three volumes of The Green Book, in which he sought to &quot;explain the structure of the ideal society.&quot; His Arab nationalist views led him to believe that there needed to be unity across the Arab world, combining the Arab nation under a single nation-state. He described his approach to economics as &quot;Islamic socialism&quot;, although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that Gaddafi's socialism had a &quot;curiously Marxist undertone&quot;, with political scientist Sami Hajjar arguing that Gaddafi's model of socialism offered a simplification of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' theories.

He was driven by a sense of &quot;divine mission&quot;, believing himself a conduit of Allah's will, and thought that he must achieve his goals &quot;no matter what the cost&quot;. Raised within the Sunni branch of Islam, Gaddafi called for the implementation of sharia within Libya. He desired unity across the Islamic world, and encouraged the propagation of the faith elsewhere. On a 2010 visit to Italy, he paid a modelling agency to find 200 young Italian women for a lecture he gave urging them to convert. He also funded the construction and renovation of two mosques in Africa, including Uganda's Kampala Mosque. He nevertheless clashed with conservative Libyan clerics as to his interpretation of Islam. Many criticised his attempts to encourage women to enter traditionally male-only sectors of society, such as the armed forces. Gaddafi was keen to improve women's status, though saw the sexes as &quot;separate but equal&quot; and therefore felt women should usually remain in traditional roles.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What variety of Islam was Gaddafi raised in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sunni</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country is Kampala Mosque located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uganda</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what ethnic culture was Gaddafi raised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bedouin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Gaddafi notably visit Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A fundamental part of Gaddafi's ideology was anti-Zionism.

Highlighting that under Gaddafi, all Libyans enjoyed free education to a university level, they point to the dramatic rise in literacy rates after the 1969 revolution. Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised. Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that under the first decade of Gaddafi's leadership, life for most Libyans &quot;undoubtedly changed for the better&quot; as material conditions and wealth drastically improved, while Libyan studies specialist Lillian Craig Harris remarked that in the early years of his administration, Libya's &quot;national wealth and international influence soared, and its national standard of living has risen dramatically.&quot; Such high standards declined during the 1980s, as a result of economic stagnation.

Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as &quot;a police state&quot;. Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that 1,270 prisoners were massacred. Dissidents abroad or &quot;stray dogs&quot; were also publicly threatened with death and sometimes killed by government hit squads. His government's treatment of non-Arab Libyans has also came in for criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya.

Gaddafi's government was frequently criticized for not being democratic, with Freedom House consistently giving Libya under Gaddafi the &quot;Not Free&quot; ranking for civil liberties and political rights.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Reagan call Gaddafi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mad dog of the Middle East</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Human Rights Watch, how many prisoners were killed on June 29, 1996?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,270</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under Gaddafi, how did Freedom House rate Libya?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Not Free</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Gaddafi call Libya dissidents based outside the country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stray dogs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what prison did extrajudicial executions occur according to HRW?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abu Salim</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>International reactions to Gaddafi's death were divided. U.S. President Barack Obama stated that it meant that &quot;the shadow of tyranny over Libya has been lifted,&quot; while UK Prime Minister David Cameron stated that he was &quot;proud&quot; of his country's role in overthrowing &quot;this brutal dictator&quot;. Contrastingly, former Cuban President Fidel Castro commented that in defying the rebels, Gaddafi would &quot;enter history as one of the great figures of the Arab nations&quot;, while Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez described him as &quot;a great fighter, a revolutionary and a martyr.&quot; Nelson Mandela expressed sadness at the news, praising Gaddafi for his anti-apartheid stance, remarking that he backed the African National Congress during &quot;the darkest moments of our struggle&quot;. Gaddafi was mourned by many as a hero across Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, a vigil was held by Muslims in Sierra Leone. The Daily Times of Nigeria stated that while undeniably a dictator, Gaddafi was the most benevolent in a region that only knew dictatorship, and that he was &quot;a great man that looked out for his people and made them the envy of all of Africa.&quot; The Nigerian newspaper Leadership reported that while many Libyans and Africans would mourn Gaddafi, this would be ignored by western media and that as such it would take 50 years before historians decided whether he was &quot;martyr or villain.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who referred to Gaddafi as a martyr?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugo Chávez</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who noted Gaddafi's opposition to apartheid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nelson Mandela</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who expressed pride at overthrowing Gaddafi's government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Cameron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country was there a notable Muslim vigil for Gaddafi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sierra Leone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said something about tyranny?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barack Obama</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following his defeat in the civil war, Gaddafi's system of governance was dismantled and replaced under the interim government of the NTC, who legalised trade unions and freedom of the press. In July 2012, elections were held to form a new General National Congress (GNC), who officially took over governance from the NTC in August. The GNC proceeded to elect Mohammed Magariaf as president of the chamber, and then voted Mustafa A.G. Abushagur as Prime Minister; when Abushagar failed to gain congressional approval, the GNC instead elected Ali Zeidan to the position. In January 2013, the GNC officially renamed the Jamahiriyah as the &quot;State of Libya&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was elected president of the GNC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mohammed Magariaf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was initially named prime minister by the GNC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mustafa A.G.
