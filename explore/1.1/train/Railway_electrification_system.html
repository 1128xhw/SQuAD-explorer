At the same voltage, DC often has less loss than AC, and for this reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A few railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle. An experimental 6 kV DC railway was built in the Soviet Union.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of electric power garantees lesser loss?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of supply for electric motors creates electromagnetic radiation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of power does require three-phase transmission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can electromagnetic radiation interfere with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">signalling and communications</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was an experimental 6kV DC railway built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Soviet Union</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>1,500 V DC is used in the Netherlands, Japan, Republic Of Indonesia, Hong Kong (parts), Republic of Ireland, Australia (parts), India (around the Mumbai area alone, has been converted to 25 kV AC like the rest of India), France (also using 25 kV 50 Hz AC), New Zealand (Wellington) and the United States (Chicago area on the Metra Electric district and the South Shore Line interurban line).

The third rail was below street level. The tram picked up the current through a plough (U.S. &quot;plow&quot;) accessed through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington DC, where the abandoned tracks have not been paved over. The slot can easily be confused with the similar looking slot for cable trams/cars (in some cases, the conduit slot was originally a cable slot). The disadvantage of conduit collection included much higher initial installation costs, higher maintenance costs, and problems with leaves and snow getting in the slot. For this reason, in Washington, D.C. cars on some lines converted to overhead wire on leaving the city center, a worker in a &quot;plough pit&quot; disconnecting the plough while another raised the trolley pole (hitherto hooked down to the roof) to the overhead wire. In New York City for the same reasons of cost and operating efficiency outside of Manhattan overhead wire was used. A similar system of changeover from conduit to overhead wire was also used on the London tramways, notably on the southern side; a typical changeover point was at Norwood, where the conduit snaked sideways from between the running rails, to provide a park for detached shoes or ploughs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the other name for the street trams?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">streetcars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is third rail situated in the street trams system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">below street level</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area in US discontinued using overhead wires for streetcars in 1962?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Washington, D.C.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What external and weather factors can effect conduit slot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">leaves and snow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the main reasons the conduit lines were converted to overhead  wire system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cost and operating efficiency</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A new approach to avoiding overhead wires is taken by the &quot;second generation&quot; tram/streetcar system in Bordeaux, France (entry into service of the first line in December 2003; original system discontinued in 1958) with its APS (alimentation par sol – ground current feed). This involves a third rail which is flush with the surface like the tops of the running rails. The circuit is divided into segments with each segment energized in turn by sensors from the car as it passes over it, the remainder of the third rail remaining &quot;dead&quot;. Since each energized segment is completely covered by the lengthy articulated cars, and goes dead before being &quot;uncovered&quot; by the passage of the vehicle, there is no danger to pedestrians.

This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What danger can return currents cause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electrolytic damage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are stray earth currents kept to a manageable levels? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by using resistors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What insures minimal current leak during power rails instalation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ceramic chairs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did return current effect water and gas in iron pipes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">water and gas mains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the crucial advantage of four-rail system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">running rail carries any current</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On tracks that London Underground share with National Rail third-rail stock (the Bakerloo and District lines both have such sections), the centre rail is connected to the running rails, allowing both types of train to operate, at a compromise voltage of 660 V.

Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two guide rails provided outside the running 'roadways' double up as conductor rails, so at least electrically it is a four-rail scheme. One of the guide rails is bonded to the return conventional running rails situated inside the roadway so a single polarity supply is required. The trains are designed to operate from either polarity of supply, because some lines use reversing loops at one end, causing the train to be reversed during every complete journey. The loop was originally provided to save the original steam locomotives having to 'run around' the rest of the train saving much time. Today, the driver does not have to change ends at termini provided with such a loop, but the time saving is not so significant as it takes almost as long to drive round the loop as it does to change ends. Many of the original loops have been lost as lines were extended.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why some lines of Paris Metro have to operate on a four-rail system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rubber tyres</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the solution for the return current problem in Paris Metro?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two guide rails</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is required in order for the guide rails to operate properly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a single polarity supply</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How train is able to turn around after each completed journey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reversing loops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the reversing loop created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">having to 'run around' the rest of the train</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An early advantage of AC is that the power-wasting resistors used in DC locomotives for speed control were not needed in an AC locomotive: multiple taps on the transformer can supply a range of voltages.

This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station to be shut down and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent the risk of an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main requirement for electric feeder stations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What invention prevented lines from getting mixed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phase Breaks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the part of wire in Phase Break sections an arc being drawn from one wire to another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The earthed section</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were the drivers warned to start coasting the train?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">warning board</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What should the driver do in order to open and close the circuit breaker?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to shut off power and coast</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nowdays electrification systems can use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main action AC and DC systems have to deal with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">converting and transporting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of losses happen during conversion and transmission in wires and electronics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ohmic losses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of losses take place in transformers and inductors during conversion/transmission process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">magnetic field losses</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Soviet Union, in the 1970s, a comparison was made between systems electrified at 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC (50 Hz). The results showed that percentage losses in the overhead wires (catenary and contact wires) was over 3 times greater for 3 kV DC than for 25 kV AC. But when the conversion losses were all taken into account and added to overhead wire losses (including cooling blower energy) the 25 kV AC lost a somewhat higher percent of energy than for 3 kV DC. Thus in spite of the much higher losses in the catenary, the 3 kV DC was a little more energy efficient than AC in providing energy from the USSR power grid to the terminals of the traction motors (all DC at that time). While both systems use energy in converting higher voltage AC from the USSR's power grid to lower voltage DC, the conversions for the DC system all took place (at higher efficiency) in the railway substation, while most of the conversion for the AC system took place inside the locomotive (at lower efficiency). Consider also that it takes energy to constantly move this mobile conversion hardware over the rails while the stationary hardware in the railway substation doesn't incur this energy cost.

When converting lines to electric, the connections with other lines must be considered. Some electrifications have subsequently been removed because of the through traffic to non-electrified lines. If through traffic is to have any benefit, time consuming engine switches must occur to make such connections or expensive dual mode engines must be used. This is mostly an issue for long distance trips, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of diesel trains even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic which is more efficient when utilizing the double-stack car also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a major factor whn it comes to electrification?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Network effects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the reason some electrifications were removed after a while?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through traffic to non-electrified lines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be a drawback of electrification of long distance freight trains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electrification to isolated areas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can the issue of through traffic benefits occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">long distance trips</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the increasing demand for container traffic make companies use more often?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diesel trains</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Additionally, there are issues of connections between different electrical services, particularly connecting intercity lines with sections electrified for commuter traffic, but also between commuter lines built to different standards. This can cause electrification of certain connections to be very expensive simply because of the implications on the sections it is connecting. Many lines have come to be overlaid with multiple electrification standards for different trains to avoid having to replace the existing rolling stock on those lines. Obviously, this requires that the economics of a particular connection must be more compelling and this has prevented complete electrification of many lines. In a few cases, there are diesel trains running along completely electrified routes and this can be due to incompatibility of electrification standards along the route.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the other issue that comes to sight when using electrification system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">connections between different electrical services</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why the commuter lines built to different standards can cause be complicated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the implications on the sections it is connecting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the solution many lines came up with in order to avoid replacing present rolling stock?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to be overlaid with multiple electrification standards</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are disel trains  still used on electrified routes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">due to incompatibility of electrification standards</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Central station electricity can often be generated with higher efficiency than a mobile engine/generator. While the efficiency of power plant generation and diesel locomotive generation are roughly the same in the nominal regime, diesel motors decrease in efficiency in non-nominal regimes at low power  while if an electric power plant needs to generate less power it will shut down its least efficient generators, thereby increasing efficiency. The electric train can save energy (as compared to diesel) by regenerative braking and by not needing to consume energy by idling as diesel locomotives do when stopped or coasting. However, electric rolling stock may run cooling blowers when stopped or coasting, thus consuming energy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of two can be more efficiently electricified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Central station</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can electric power plant become more power efficient?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it will shut down its least efficient generators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can electric train be more energy efficient?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by regenerative braking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of train continues to use energy while coasting or being stopped?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diesel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes electric trains to waste energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cooling blowers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Energy sources unsuitable for mobile power plants, such as nuclear power, renewable hydroelectricity, or wind power can be used. According to widely accepted global energy reserve statistics, the reserves of liquid fuel are much less than gas and coal (at 42, 167 and 416 years respectively). Most countries with large rail networks do not have significant oil reserves and those that did, like the United States and Britain, have exhausted much of their reserves and have suffered declining oil output for decades. Therefore, there is also a strong economic incentive to substitute other fuels for oil. Rail electrification is often considered an important route towards consumption pattern reform. However, there are no reliable, peer-reviewed studies available to assist in rational public debate on this critical issue, although there are untranslated Soviet studies from the 1980s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can renewable source of electricity be used in mobile power plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unsuitable</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the recent incentive in  order to overcome oil scarcity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to substitute other fuels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of natural resources is more scarce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">liquid fuel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What research can be used in the future if translated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soviet studies from the 1980s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the former Soviet Union, electric traction eventually became somewhat more energy-efficient than diesel. Partly due to inefficient generation of electricity in the USSR (only 20.8% thermal efficiency in 1950 vs. 36.2% in 1975), in 1950 diesel traction was about twice as energy efficient as electric traction (in terms of net tonne-km of freight per kg of fuel). But as efficiency of electricity generation (and thus of electric traction) improved, by about 1965 electric railways became more efficient than diesel. After the mid 1970s electrics used about 25% less fuel per ton-km. However diesels were mainly used on single track lines with a fair amount of traffic  so that the lower fuel consumption of electrics may be in part due to better operating conditions on electrified lines (such as double tracking) rather than inherent energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the cost of diesel fuel was about 1.5 times more (per unit of heat energy content) than that of the fuel used in electric power plants (that generated electricity), thus making electric railways even more energy-cost effective.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of trains became more energy-efficient in the former Soviet Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electric</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year could be marked as year when electric railways more efficient than diesel ones?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much fuel did electric train used less than diesel in the middle of 1970 in USSR?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25% less fuel per ton-km</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could be a factor of lower energy consumption for electric trains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">better operating conditions on electrified lines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much more expensive was diesel compare to electricity per unit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.5 times more (per unit of heat energy content</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Besides increased efficiency of power plants, there was an increase in efficiency (between 1950 and 1973) of the railway utilization of this electricity with energy-intensity dropping from 218 to 124 kwh/10,000 gross tonne-km (of both passenger and freight trains) or a 43% drop. Since energy-intensity is the inverse of energy-efficiency it drops as efficiency goes up. But most of this 43% decrease in energy-intensity also benefited diesel traction. The conversion of wheel bearings from plain to roller, increase of train weight, converting single track lines to double track (or partially double track), and the elimination of obsolete 2-axle freight cars increased the energy-efficiency of all types of traction: electric, diesel, and steam. However, there remained a 12–15% reduction of energy-intensity that only benefited electric traction (and not diesel). This was due to improvements in locomotives, more widespread use of regenerative braking (which in 1989 recycled 2.65% of the electric energy used for traction,) remote control of substations, better handling of the locomotive by the locomotive crew, and improvements in automation. Thus the overall efficiency of electric traction as compared to diesel more than doubled between 1950 and the mid-1970s in the Soviet Union. But after 1974 (thru 1980) there was no improvement in energy-intensity (wh/tonne-km) in part due to increasing speeds of passenger and freight trains.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the energy efficiency to go up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">energy-intensity dropping</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of locomotives got improved during 1950-1973 in Soviet Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electric</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of energy was saved and re-used due to regenerative braking in 1989?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2.65%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was there an energy efficiency improvement in the period 1974 through 1980?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no improvement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Elimination of what helped the efficiency of diesel traction to go up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2-axle freight cars</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
