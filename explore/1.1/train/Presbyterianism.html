Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government, which is governed by representative assemblies of elders. Many Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word &quot;Presbyterian,&quot; when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to the churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English churches that bore that name and English political groups that formed during the English Civil War. Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 which created the kingdom of Great Britain. In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants. The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there are a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism. Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can you trace back the origins of Presbyterianism back to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Isles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Presbyterian church typically emphasize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sovereignty of God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which act created the kingdom of Great Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Britain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the European Reformation of the 16th century; the example of John Calvin's Geneva being particularly influential. Most Reformed churches which trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government. In the twentieth century, some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement, including the World Council of Churches. Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches. Some Presbyterian churches have entered into unions with other churches, such as Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists. Presbyterians in the United States came largely from Scotch-Irish immigrants communities, and also from New England Yankee communities that had originally been Congregational but changed because of an agreed-upon &quot;Plan of Union of 1801&quot; for frontier areas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do most presbyterian churches trace their history back to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scotland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the reformation during the roots of Presbyterianism take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group did Presbyterian churches union with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Presbyterian history is part of the history of Christianity, but the beginning of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement occurred during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. As the Catholic Church resisted the reformers, several different theological movements splintered from the Church and bore different denominations. Presbyterianism was especially influenced by the French theologian John Calvin, who is credited with the development of Reformed theology, and the work of John Knox, a Scotsman who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland and brought his teachings back to Scotland. The Presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to England and Scotland. In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland adopted the Scots Confession as the creed of the Scottish Kingdom. In December 1560, the First Book of Discipline was published, outlining important doctrinal issues but also establishing regulations for church government, including the creation of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed superintendents which later became known as presbyteries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other religion has history as being part of Presbyterian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which frenchman greatly influenced Presbyterianism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Calvin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the parliament of Scotland adopt the Scots Confession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1560</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which book was touted for establishing regulations for church and government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">First Book of Discipline</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organization (or &quot;church order&quot;) and worship; often using a &quot;Book of Order&quot; to regulate common practice and order. The origins of the Presbyterian churches are in Calvinism. Many branches of Presbyterianism are remnants of previous splits from larger groups. Some of the splits have been due to doctrinal controversy, while some have been caused by disagreement concerning the degree to which those ordained to church office should be required to agree with the Westminster Confession of Faith, which historically serves as an important confessional document – second only to the Bible, yet directing particularities in the standardization and translation of the Bible – in Presbyterian churches.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term described the method used to regulate common practice and or order?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Book of Order</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which document is an important confessional document second only to the Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Westminster Confession of Faith</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other name is used when referring to the origins of the Presbyterian Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calvinism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Presbyterians place great importance upon education and lifelong learning.

It is generally considered that the point of such learning is to enable one to put one's faith into practice; some Presbyterians generally exhibit their faith in action as well as words, by generosity, hospitality, as well as proclaiming the gospel of Christ.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Presbyterians put importance into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">education and lifelong learning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do their studies consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scriptures, theological writings, and understanding and interpretation of church doctrine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do Presbyterians exhibit their faith?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by generosity, hospitality, as well as proclaiming the gospel of Christ.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Presbyterian government is by councils (known as courts) of elders.

This has two implications. The obvious one is that confessional churches express their faith in the form of &quot;confessions of faith,&quot; which have some level of authoritative status. However this is based on a more subtle point: In confessional churches, theology is not solely an individual matter. While individuals are encouraged to understand Scripture, and may challenge the current institutional understanding, theology is carried out by the community as a whole. It is this community understanding of theology that is expressed in confessions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Presbyterianism is based on this type of tradition, what is it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">confessional tradition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Confessional churches express this form of confession, what is it named?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">confessions of faith</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is not a sole matter individually in a confessional church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">theology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is theology carried out in a confessional church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by the community as a whole</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some Presbyterian traditions adopt only the Westminster Confession of Faith as the doctrinal standard to which teaching elders are required to subscribe, in contrast to the Larger and Shorter catechisms, which are approved for use in instruction.

There may be a rail between the communion table and the &quot;Chancel&quot; behind it, which may contain a more decorative altar-type table, choir loft, or choir stalls, lectern and clergy area. The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the &quot;empty&quot; cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross. This not only emphasized the resurrection, but also acknowledges historical aspects of Presbyterianism. A baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area. Presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. You may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible. Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper located behind the Chancel. St. Giles Cathedral ( Church Of Scotland- The Mother Church of Presbyterians) does have a Crucifix next to one of the Pulpits that hangs alongside.

After a period of religious convulsion and political conflict culminating in a victory for the Protestant party at the Siege of Leith the authority of the Church of Rome was abolished in favour of Reformation by the legislation of the Scottish Reformation Parliament in 1560. The Church was eventually organised by Andrew Melville along Presbyterian lines to become the national Church of Scotland. King James VI and I moved the Church of Scotland towards an episcopal form of government, and in 1637, James' successor, Charles I and William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to force the Church of Scotland to use the Book of Common Prayer. What resulted was an armed insurrection, with many Scots signing the Solemn League and Covenant. The Covenanters would serve as the government of Scotland for nearly a decade, and would also send military support to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II, despite the initial support that he received from the Covenanters, reinstated an episcopal form of government on the church.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did John Knox past away?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1572</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Knox do when he returned to Scotland after studying under Calvin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to reform the Church in line with Calvinist doctrines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The church of Scotland was organized by this person, whats his name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andrew Melville</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Government of church reinstated? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1660</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Church of Scotland was finally unequivocally recognised as a Presbyterian institution by the monarch due to Scottish Presbyterian support for the aforementioned revolution and the Acts of Union 1707 between Scotland and England guaranteed the Church of Scotland's form of government.

In 1733, a group of ministers seceded from the Church of Scotland to form the Associate Presbytery, another group seceded in 1761 to form the Relief Church and the Disruption of 1843 led to the formation of the Free Church of Scotland.

Thomas Cartwright is thought to be the first Presbyterian in England. Cartwright's controversial lectures at Cambridge University condemning the episcopal hierarchy of the Elizabethan Church led to his deprivation of his post by Archbishop John Whitgift and his emigration abroad. Between 1645 and 1648, a series of ordinances of the Long Parliament established Presbyterianism as the polity of the Church of England. Presbyterian government was established in London and Lancashire and in a few other places in England, although Presbyterian hostility to the execution of Charles I and the establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England meant that Parliament never enforced the Presbyterian system in England. The re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660 brought the return of Episcopal church government in England (and in Scotland for a short time); but the Presbyterian church in England continued in Non-Conformity, outside of the established church. In 1719 a major split, the Salter's Hall controversy, occurred; with the majority siding with nontrinitarian views. Thomas Bradbury published several sermons bearing on the controversy, and in 1719, &quot;An answer to the reproaches cast on the dissenting ministers who subscribed their belief of the Eternal Trinity.&quot;.

English Presbyterian missionary James Laidlaw Maxwell established the first Presbyterian church in Tainan in 1865. His colleague George Leslie Mackay, of the Canadian Presbyterian Mission, was active in Danshui and north Taiwan from 1872 to 1901; he founded the island's first university and hospital, and created a written script for Taiwanese Minnan. The English and Canadian missions joined together as the PCT in 1912. One of the few churches permitted to operate in Taiwan through the era of Japanese rule (1895–1945), the PCT experienced rapid growth during the era of Guomindang-imposed martial law (1949–1987), in part due to its support for democracy, human rights, and Taiwan independence. Former ROC president Lee Teng-hui (in office 1988–2000) is a Presbyterian.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the largest Presbyterian church in Taiwan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Presbyterian Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many members make up The Presbyterian Church denomination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">238,372</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person to bring Presbyterianism into Taiwan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Laidlaw Maxwell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what era did The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan experience a large growth in members?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">era of Guomindang</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the mainly Christian Indian state of Mizoram, the Presbyterian denomination is the largest denomination; it was brought to the region with missionaries from Wales in 1894. Prior to Mizoram, the Welsh Presbyterians (missionaries) started venturing into the north-east of India through the Khasi Hills (presently located within the state of Meghalaya in India) and established Presbyterian churches all over the Khasi Hills from the 1840s onwards. Hence there is a strong presence of Presbyterians in Shillong (the present capital of Meghalaya) and the areas adjoining it. The Welsh missionaries built their first church in Sohra (aka Cherrapunji) in 1846. Presbyterians participated in the mergers that resulted in the Church of North India and the Church of South India.Sohra</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the largest Presbyterian denomination brought to Mizoram?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1894</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before Mizoram, what was the name of the group of  missionaries that  ventured into east india?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Welsh Presbyterians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Welsh Presbyterians build there first church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sohra</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Australia, Presbyterianism is the fourth largest denomination of Christianity, with nearly 600,000 Australians claiming to be Presbyterian in the 2006 Commonwealth Census. Presbyterian churches were founded in each colony, some with links to the Church of Scotland and others to the Free Church. There were also congregations originating from United Presbyterian Church of Scotland as well as a number founded by John Dunmore Lang. Most of these bodies merged between 1859 and 1870, and in 1901 formed a federal union called the Presbyterian Church of Australia but retaining their state assemblies. The Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia representing the Free Church of Scotland tradition, and congregations in Victoria of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, originally from Ireland, are the other existing denominations dating from colonial times.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many members make up the Presbyterian church in Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">600,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Australian church follows the traditions of Scotland Presbyterians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most of the churches in Australia merged in which years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1859 and 1870, and in 1901</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1977, two thirds of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, along with most of the Congregational Union of Australia and all the Methodist Church of Australasia, combined to form the Uniting Church in Australia. The third who did not unite had various reasons for so acting, often cultural attachment but often conservative theological or social views. The permission for the ordination of women given in 1974 was rescinded in 1991 without affecting the two or three existing woman ministers. The approval of women elders given in the 1960s has been rescinded in all states except New South Wales, which has the largest membership. The theology of the church is now generally conservative and Reformed. A number of small Presbyterian denominations have arisen since the 1950s through migration or schism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Presbyterian Church of Australia , the Congregational Union of Australia , and all the Methodist Church of Australasia merge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1977</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was ordination of woman ministries recsinded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The approval of women elders which was given in 1960 has been rescinded in all of the Australian states except one, which state did not?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New South Wales</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Presbyterian Church in Vanuatu is the largest denomination in the country, with approximately one-third of the population of Vanuatu members of the church. The PCV was taken to Vanuatu by missionaries from Scotland. The PCV (Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu) is headed by a moderator with offices in Port Vila. The PCV is particularly strong in the provinces of Tafea, Shefa, and Malampa. The Province of Sanma is mainly Presbyterian with a strong Roman Catholic minority in the Francophone areas of the province. There are some Presbyterian people, but no organised Presbyterian churches in Penama and Torba, both of which are traditionally Anglican. Vanuatu is the only country in the South Pacific with a significant Presbyterian heritage and membership. The PCV is a founding member of the Vanuatu Christian Council (VCC). The PCV runs many primary schools and Onesua secondary school.
