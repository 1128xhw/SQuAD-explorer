During the 13th century, the native Prussians were conquered by the crusading Teutonic Knights. The indigenous Balts who survived the conquest were gradually converted to Christianity. Because of Germanization and colonisation over the following centuries, Germans became the dominant ethnic group, while Poles and Lithuanians formed minorities. From the 13th century, East Prussia was part of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. After the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466 it became a fief of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1525, with the Prussian Homage, the province became the Duchy of Prussia. The Old Prussian language had become extinct by the 17th or early 18th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who defeated the native Prussians during the 13 century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teutonic Knights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other groups during this period for form minorities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Poles and Lithuanians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Balts were gradually converted into which religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ethnic group become dominant following the 13 century just a few hundred years later?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around when did the Old Prussian language become extinct?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17th or early 18th century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because the duchy was outside of the core Holy Roman Empire, the prince-electors of Brandenburg were able to proclaim themselves King of Prussia beginning in 1701.

Following Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II in 1945, war-torn East Prussia was divided at Joseph Stalin's insistence between the Soviet Union (the Kaliningrad Oblast in the Russian SFSR and the constituent counties of the Klaipėda Region in the Lithuanian SSR) and the People's Republic of Poland (the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship). The capital city Königsberg was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946. The German population of the province was largely evacuated during the war or expelled shortly thereafter in the expulsion of Germans after World War II. An estimated 300,000 (around one fifth of the population) died either in war time bombings raids or in the battles to defend the province.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Kingdom of Prussia become the leading state of the German Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1871</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What well known treaty would eventually would grant West Prussia to Poland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Versailles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Nazi's fall in World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1945</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many died trying to defend the province in Kaliningrad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">300,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Upon the invitation of Duke Konrad I of Masovia, the Teutonic Knights took possession of Prussia in the 13th century and created a monastic state to administer the conquered Old Prussians. Local Old-Prussian (north) and Polish (south) toponyms were gradually Germanised. The Knights' expansionist policies, including occupation of Polish Pomerania with Gdańsk/Danzig and western Lithuania, brought them into conflict with the Kingdom of Poland and embroiled them in several wars, culminating in the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, whereby the united armies of Poland and Lithuania, defeated the Teutonic Order at the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410. Its defeat was formalised in the Second Treaty of Thorn in 1466 ending the Thirteen Years' War, and leaving the former Polish region Pomerania/Pomerelia under Polish control. Together with Warmia it formed the province of Royal Prussia. Eastern Prussia remained under the Knights, but as a fief of Poland. 1466 and 1525 arrangements by kings of Poland were not verified by the Holy Roman Empire as well as the previous gains of the Teutonic Knights were not verified.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group took possession of Prussia in the 13th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Teutonic Knights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two areas were slowly Germanized during the 13th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old-Prussian (north) and Polish (south) toponyms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the knights of expansionist polices eventually lead to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several wars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Second Treaty of Thorn enacted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1466</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Teutonic Order lost eastern Prussia when Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach converted to Lutheranism and secularized the Prussian branch of the Teutonic Order in 1525.

Walter von Cronberg, the next Grand Master, was enfeoffed with the title to Prussia after the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, but the Order never regained possession of the territory.

Darré, a neopaganist rural romantic, wanted to enforce his vision of an agricultural East Prussia. When his &quot;Land&quot; representatives challenged Koch's plans, Koch had them arrested.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were East Prussians able to pay for land improvements and road construction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">publicly funded emergency relief programs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the initiative to help with the new projects in East Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Erich Koch Plan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Koch report to Hitler in 1933?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that unemployment had been banished entirely</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1938 the Nazis altered about one-third of the toponyms of the area, eliminating, Germanizing, or simplifying a number of Old Prussian names, as well as those Polish or Lithuanian names originating from colonists and refugees to Prussia during and after the Protestant Reformation.
