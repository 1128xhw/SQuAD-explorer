However, Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient India and the Delhi Sultanate, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire (as it was officially called) from Calcutta to Delhi. Unlike Calcutta, which was located on the eastern coast of India, Delhi was at the centre of northern India and the Government of British India felt that it would be logistically easier to administer India from the latter rather than the former.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city was the capital of India until December 1911?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calcutta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the city formerly known as Calcutta?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kolkata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the empire for which Delhi served as the political and financial capital from 1649 to 1857?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mughal Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the early 1900s, the capital of the British Indian Empire was shifted from Calcutta to what city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Delhi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what part of India is Delhi located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the centre of northern India</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 12 December 1911, during the Delhi Durbar, George V, then Emperor of India, along with Queen Mary, his Consort, made the announcement that the capital of the Raj was to be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi, while laying the foundation stone for the Viceroy's residence in the Coronation Park, Kingsway Camp. The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by King George V and Queen Mary at the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911 at Kingsway Camp on 15 December 1911, during their imperial visit. Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens (Sir Edwin from 1918), who first visited Delhi in 1912, and Herbert Baker (Sir Herbert from 1926), both leading 20th-century British architects. The contract was given to Sobha Singh (later Sir Sobha Singh). Construction really began after World War I and was completed by 1931. The city that was later dubbed &quot;Lutyens' Delhi&quot; was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on 10 February 1931 by Lord Irwin, the Viceroy. Lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain's imperial aspirations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who announced that the capital of India would be moved from Calcutta to Delhi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was it announced that the capital of India would be moved to Delhi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12 December 1911</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who laid the foundation stone of New Delhi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King George V and Queen Mary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for designing large parts of New Delhi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edwin Lutyens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did inauguration ceremonies for New Delhi begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 February 1931</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Soon Lutyens started considering other places. Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, with George Swinton as chairman and John A. Brodie and Lutyens as members, submitted reports for both North and South sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at India Gate, was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the Viceroy's House at one end with Paharganj at the other. During the project's early years, many tourists believed it was a gate from Earth to Heaven itself. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the North side, the committee settled on the South site. A site atop the Raisina Hill, formerly Raisina Village, a Meo village, was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy's House. The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel, which was also considered the site of Indraprastha, the ancient region of Delhi. Subsequently, the foundation stone was shifted from the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911–1912, where the Coronation Pillar stood, and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the Secretariat. The Rajpath, also known as King's Way, stretched from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The Secretariat building, the two blocks of which flank the Rashtrapati Bhawan and houses ministries of the Government of India, and the Parliament House, both designed by Herbert Baker, are located at the Sansad Marg and run parallel to the Rajpath.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who rejected the proposals of Brodie and Lutyens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Viceroy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which site was eventually chosen by the Delhi Town Planning Committee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the South site</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Raisina Hill lay directly opposite what religious site?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dinapanah citadel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Rajpath was also known by what name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King's Way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the Parliament House of New Delhi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Herbert Baker</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the south, land up to Safdarjung's Tomb was acquired in order to create what is today known as Lutyens' Bungalow Zone. Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of Raisina Hill, a circular railway line around the Council House (now Parliament House), called the Imperial Delhi Railway, was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years. The last stumbling block was the Agra-Delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial (India Gate) and Kingsway (Rajpath), which was a problem because the Old Delhi Railway Station served the entire city at that time. The line was shifted to run along the Yamuna river, and it began operating in 1924. The New Delhi Railway Station opened in 1926 with a single platform at Ajmeri Gate near Paharganj and was completed in time for the city's inauguration in 1931. As construction of the Viceroy's House (the present Rashtrapati Bhavan), Central Secretariat, Parliament House, and All-India War Memorial (India Gate) was winding down, the building of a shopping district and a new plaza, Connaught Place, began in 1929, and was completed by 1933.

Many employees were brought into the new capital from distant parts of India, including the Bengal Presidency and Madras Presidency. Subsequently housing for them was developed around Gole Market area in the 1920s.
