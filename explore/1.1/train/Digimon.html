The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a &quot;Digital World&quot;, a parallel universe that originated from Earth's various communication networks. In many incarnations, Digimon are raised by humans called &quot;Digidestined&quot; or &quot;Tamers&quot;, and they team up to defeat evil Digimon and human villains who are trying to destroy the fabric of the Digital world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Digimon stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digital Monsters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What forms of entertainment does the Digimon franchise include?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">virtual pet toys, anime, manga, video games, films and a trading card game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Digital World in which the Digimon creatures live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a parallel universe that originated from Earth's various communication networks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the people who raise Digimon called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Digidestined&quot; or &quot;Tamers&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Digimon villians main goals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trying to destroy the fabric of the Digital world</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The franchise was first created in 1997 as a series of virtual pets, akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American comics. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, Digimon Adventure, and an early video game, Digimon World, both released in 1999. Several seasons of the anime and films based on them have aired, and the video game series has expanded into genres such as role-playing, racing, fighting, and MMORPGs. Other media forms have also been released.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Digimon first appear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name the original Digimon anime.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digimon Adventure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name the Digimon video game that was released in 1999.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digimon World</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name two types of toys the original Digimon bore a close resemblence to.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Digimon series created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What influenced the look of the Digimons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Digimon video game released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1999</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Digimon was first conceived as a virtual pet toy in the vein of Tamagotchis and, as such, took influence from Tamagotchis' cute and round designs. The small areas of the screens (16 by 16 pixels) meant that character designers had to create monsters whose forms would be easily recognizable. As such, many of the early Digimon—including Tyrannomon, the first one ever created—were based on dinosaurs. Many further designs were created by Kenji Watanabe, who was brought in to help with the &quot;X-Antibody&quot; creatures and art for the Digimon collectible card game. Watanabe was one influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and &quot;cool.&quot; The character creation process, however, has for most of the franchise's history been collaborative and reliant on conversation and brainstorming.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of toy were the original Digimon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">virtual pet toy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of creatures where the early digimon patterned after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dinosaurs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What properties of american comics were the later generations of digimon trying to capture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stronger and &quot;cool.&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the designer responsible for the westernization of Digimon character design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kenji Watanabe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the original Digimon character?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tyrannomon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the screen size of the Digimon toy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16 by 16 pixels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animals were the digimon based off of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dinosaurs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the designer of the Digimon card game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kenji Watanabe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Watanabe get his influence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American comics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called Digi-Eggs (デジタマ, Dejitama?). In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of Digi-Egg that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a Digimental (デジメンタル, Dejimentaru?) in Japanese. (This type of Digi-Egg was also featured as a major object throughout season 2 as a way of Digivolution available only to certain characters at certain points throughout the season.) They age via a process called &quot;Digivolution&quot; which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of intelligence and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages of evolution known as Ultimate and Mega in the dub.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do digimon evolve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digimental</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are digimon born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called Digi-Eggs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process of aging called for digimon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digivolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What effect does digivolution have on digimon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">changes their appearance and increases their powers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are digimon all mindless monsters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Some Digimon act feral.

The V-Pet is similar to its predecessors, with the exceptions of being more difficult and being able to fight other Digimon v-pets. Every owner would start with a Baby Digimon, train it, evolve it, take care of it, and then have battles with other Digimon owners to see who was stronger. The Digimon pet had several evolution capabilities and abilities too, so many owners had different Digimon.

It also features an appearance by a character from the Adventure universe. In addition, each series has spawned assorted feature films. Digimon still shows popularity, as new card series, video games, and movies are still being produced and released: new card series include Eternal Courage, Hybrid Warriors, Generations, and Operation X; the video game, Digimon Rumble Arena 2; and the previously unreleased movies Revenge of Diaboromon, Runaway Locomon, Battle of Adventurers, and Island of Lost Digimon.

Its premise is a group of 7 kids who, while at summer camp, travel to the Digital World, inhabited by creatures known as Digital Monsters, or Digimon, learning they are chosen to be &quot;DigiDestined&quot; (&quot;Chosen Children&quot; in the Japanese version) to save both the Digital and Real World from evil. Each Kid was given a Digivice which selected them to be transported to the DigiWorld and was destined to be paired up with a Digimon Partner, such as Tai being paired up with Agumon and Matt with Gabumon. The children are helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai, who helps them via hologram. The Digivices help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into stronger creatures in times of peril. The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations, such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms. Later, each character discovered a crest that each belonged to a person; Tai the Crest of Courage, Matt the Crest of Friendship, Sora the Crest of Love, Izzy the Crest of Knowledge, Mimi the Crest of Sincerity, Joe the Crest of Reliability, T.K. the Crest of Hope, and later Kari the Crest of Light which allowed their Digimon to digivolve into their Ultimate forms. The group consisted of seven original characters: Taichi &quot;Tai&quot; Kamiya, Yamato &quot;Matt&quot; Ishida, Sora Takenouchi, Koushiro &quot;Izzy&quot; Izumi, Mimi Tachikawa, Joe Kido, and Takeru &quot;T.K.&quot; Takaishi.

Three years later, with most of the original DigiDestined now in high school at age fourteen, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, a new evil has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor (Digimon Kaiser) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has been enslaving Digimon with Dark Rings and Control Spires and has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. However, five set Digi-Eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new DigiDestined along with T.K. and Kari, two of the DigiDestined from the previous series. This new evolutionary process, dubbed Armor Digivolution helps the new DigiDestined to defeat evil lurking in the Digital World. Eventually, the DigiDestined defeat the Digimon Emperor, more commonly known as Ken Ichijouji on Earth, only with the great sacrifice of Ken's own Digimon, Wormmon. Just when things were thought to be settled, new Digimon enemies made from the deactivated Control Spires start to appear and cause trouble in the Digital World. To atone for his past mistakes, Ken joins the DigiDestined, being a DigiDestined himself, with his Partner Wormmon revived to fight against them. They soon save countries including France and Australia from control spires and defeat MaloMyotismon (BelialVamdemon), the digivolved form of Myotismon (Vamdemon) from the previous series. They stop the evil from destroying the two worlds, and at the end, every person on Earth gains their own Digimon partner.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the second series of Digimon air?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 2, 2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What age are the original DigiDestined now that they are in High School?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fourteen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the new evil force that has been enslaving people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digimon Kaiser</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ken do in order to atone for his mistakes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">joins the DigiDestined</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The third Digimon series, which began airing on April 1, 2001, is set largely in a &quot;real world&quot; where the Adventure and Adventure 02 series are television shows, and where Digimon game merchandise (based on actual items) become key to providing power boosts to real Digimon which appear in that world. The plot revolves around three Tamers, Takato Matsuki, Rika Nonaka, and Henry Wong. It began with Takato creating his own Digimon partner by sliding a mysterious blue card through his card reader, which then became a D-Power. Guilmon takes form from Takato's sketchings of a new Digimon. (Tamers’ only human connection to the Adventure series is Ryo Akiyama, a character featured in some of the Digimon video games and who made an appearance in some occasions of the Adventure story-line.) Some of the changes in this series include the way the Digimon digivolve with the introduction of Biomerge-Digivolution and the way their &quot;Digivices&quot; work. In this series, the Tamers can slide game cards through their &quot;Digivices&quot; and give their Digimon partners certain advantages, as in the card game. This act is called &quot;Digi-Modify&quot; (Card Slash in the Japanese version). The same process was often used to Digivolve the Digimon, but as usual, emotions play a big part in the digivolving process. Unlike the two seasons before it and most of the seasons that followed, Digimon Tamers takes a darker and more realistic approach to its story featuring Digimon who do not reincarnate after their deaths and more complex character development in the original Japanese. The anime has become controversial over the decade, with debates about how appropriate this show actually is for its &quot;target&quot; audience, especially due to the Lovecraftian nature of the last arc. The English dub is more lighthearted dialogue-wise, though still not as much as previous series.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the third Digimon series begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 1, 2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can tamers do in order to give their partners advantages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">slide game cards through their &quot;Digivices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the act called of giving partners advantages in Digimon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digi-Modify</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The fourth Digimon series, which began airing on April 7, 2002, radically departs from the previous three by focusing on a new and very different kind of evolution, Spirit Evolution, in which the human characters use their D-Tectors (this series' Digivice) to transform themselves into special Digimon called Legendary Warriors, detracting from the customary formula of having digital partners. After receiving unusual phone messages from Ophanimon (one of the three ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and Cherubimon) Takuya Kanbara, Koji Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto, Tommy Himi, and Koichi Kimura go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World. Summoned by Ophanimon, the Digidestined realize that they must find the ten legendary spirits and stop the forces of Cherubimon from physically destroying the Digital World. After finding the ten spirits of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon, Grumblemon, Ranamon, and Arbormon, they finally end up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. After the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal Knights—Dynasmon and Crusadermon—from destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical Lucemon. Ultimately the Digidestined fail in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the Real World. In the final battle, all of the legendary spirits the digidestined have collected thus far merge and create Susanoomon. With this new form, the digidestined are able to effectively defeat Lucemon and save the Digital World. In general, Frontier has a much lighter tone than that of Tamers, yet remains darker than Adventure and Adventure 02.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the fourth series of Digimon begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 7, 2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main focus surrounding the fourth series?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spirit Evolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the characters use to transform themselves into special Digimons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">D-Tectors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the characters transformed into special Digimons, what were they called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Legendary Warriors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After a three-year hiatus, a fifth Digimon series began airing on April 2, 2006. Like Frontier, Savers has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (&quot;Digital Accident Tactics Squad&quot;), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad requires the human partner's DNA (&quot;Digital Natural Ability&quot; in the English version and &quot;Digisoul&quot; in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon's attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver are not edited and used in the English dub. Well Go USA released it on DVD instead of Disney. The North American English dub was televised on Jetix in the U.S. and on the Family Channel in Canada.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did Digimon stay off the air before returning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three-year hiatus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the fifth  series start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 2, 2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main focus of the 5th season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">D.A.T.S.

It began airing in Japan on TV Asahi from July 6, 2010 onwards. Reverting to the design style of the first four series as well as the plot taking on the younger, lighter tone present in series one, two and four throughout the story. The story follows a boy named Mikey Kudō (Taiki Kudo in Japan) who, along with his friends, ends up in the Digital World where they meet Shoutmon and his Digimon friends. Wielding a digivice known as a Fusion Loader (Xros Loader in Japan), Mikey is able to combine multiple Digimon onto one to enhance his power, Shoutmon being the usual core of the combination, using a technique known as 'DigiFuse' (Digi-Xros in Japan). Forming Team Fusion Fighters (Team Xros Heart in Japan), Mikey, Shoutmon and their friends travel through the Digital World to liberate it from the evil Bagra Army, led by Bagramon(Lord Bagra in English), and Midnight, a shady group led by AxeKnightmon with Nene as a figurehead before joining the Fusion Fighters. The Fusion Fighters also finds themselves at odds with Blue Flare, led by Christopher Aonuma (Kiriha Anouma in Japan). The second arc of Xros Wars was subtitled The Evil Death Generals and the Seven Kingdoms. It saw the main cast reshuffled with a new wardrobe while Angie (Akari in Japan) and Jeremy (Zenjiro in Japan) stay behind in the Human World; thus making Mikey, Christopher and Nene the lead protagonists as they set off to face the Seven Death Generals of the Bagra Army and AxeKnightmon's new pawn: Nene's brother Ewan (Yuu in Japan). A new evolution known as Super Digivolution was introduced at the end of the first arc. The English dub of the series began airing on Nickelodeon on September 7, 2013, which is produced by Saban Brands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long after the 5th season did the next one start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Three and a quarter years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the sixth season of Digimon begin airing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 6, 2010</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the main character in the sixth Digimon series?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mikey Kudō</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Fusion fighters find themselves in battle with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Blue Flare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the English dub for the sixth season start airing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 7, 2013</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On August 17, 2011, Shueisha's V-Jump magazine announced a sequel set one year later, a third arc of Xros Wars subtitled The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time, which aired from October 2, 2011 to March 25, 2012, following on from the previous arc.

Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official Digimon Magazine and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, Wickid. These original stories only roughly followed the continuity of Adventure 02. When the comic switched to the Tamers series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as Mitsuo Yamaki's past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from Digimon Magazine, which returned to printing translated German adaptations of Tamers episodes.
