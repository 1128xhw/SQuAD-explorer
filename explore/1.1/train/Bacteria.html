There are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested bacterial life forms thrive in the Mariana Trench, which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest part of the Earth's oceans. Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States. According to one of the researchers, &quot;You can find microbes everywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What amount of bacteria can be found in a gram of soil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">40 million bacterial cells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bacteria cells can be in a milliltre of fresh water?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">million bacterial cells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does bacteria help to sustain life in hydrothermal vents and cold seeps?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by converting dissolved compounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What deepest part of the ocean was bacteria found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mariana Trench</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can bacteria survive inside rocks under the sea level?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thrive inside rocks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are approximately ten times as many bacterial cells in the human flora as there are human cells in the body, with the largest number of the human flora being in the gut flora, and a large number on the skin. The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, and some are beneficial. However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the ratio of human/bacteria cells in human flora?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ten times as many bacterial cells</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What keeps bacteria at bay in human body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the immune system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of bacteria can cause infectious diseases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pathogenic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the deadliest diseases caused by bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">respiratory infections</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes bacteria resistant to antibiotic treatment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">farming</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Once regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes.

For about 3 billion years, most organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life. In 2008, fossils of macroorganisms were discovered and named as the Francevillian biota. Although bacterial fossils exist, such as stromatolites, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage. Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g. in ancient &quot;amitochondrial&quot; protozoa). Later on, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms. This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants. There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events. Here, eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a &quot;second-generation&quot; plastid. This is known as secondary endosymbiosis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the first antecedents of bacteria appear on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4 billion years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were bacteria and archaea dominant forms of life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most organisms were microscopic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Stromatolites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bacterial fossils</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What pre-historic group did bacteria evolve from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">archaeal/eukaryotic lineage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did chloroplast appear in first vegetation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called morphologies.

Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface area to volume ratio of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments.

Certain bacterial species, such as the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vesicles, which they use to regulate their buoyancy – allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions are considered to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue. Gas vacuoles, which are freely permeable to gas, are membrane-bound vesicles present in some species of Cyanobacteria. They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy.

Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively.

In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does gram-positive bacteria have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why gram-negative cell bacteria is more toxic than gram-positive bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polysaccharides and lipid A</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be endotoxins called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lipopolysaccharides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can different structure of the cell walls of bacteria effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">differences in antibiotic susceptibility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main defense of human body against eye infections?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacteria, are resistant to decolorization by acids during staining procedures.

When a population of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, also known as the logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the first stage of bacteria adaptation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lag phase</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the second phase of bacteria growth known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rapid exponential growth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The absence of what causes the last stage of bacteria growth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nutrients</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is called the third statge of growth of bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stationary phase</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many phase are in the growth of bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four phases</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most bacteria have a single circular chromosome that can range in size from only 160,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria Candidatus Carsonella ruddii, to 12,200,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacteria Sorangium cellulosum.

While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasizes molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridization, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology.

These two domains, along with Eukarya, are the basis of the three-domain system, which is currently the most widely used classification system in microbiolology.

Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How pathogenes interact with it's human host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can all bacteria in human body  be harmful?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which bacteria cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever disiease?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">species of Rickettsia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of antibiotics called bacterocidal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">if they kill bacteria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of antibiotics are used for prevention of bacterial growth</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bacteriostatic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the drawback of using antibiotics if agriculture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides in treating human disease where else are antibiotics used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in intensive farming to promote animal growth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is common prevention method of infections in medicine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sterilizing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertilizer was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What quality of bacteria is being widely used re-cyling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is being used in cleaning up oil spills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bacteria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other way is bacteria aiding to nature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">used for the bioremediation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sciences use bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope of his own design. He then published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London. Bacteria were Leeuwenhoek's most remarkable microscopic discovery. They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and, in one of the most striking hiatuses in the history of science, no one else would see them again for over a century. Only then were his by-then-largely-forgotten observations of bacteria — as opposed to his famous &quot;animalcules&quot; (spermatozoa) — taken seriously.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first time bacteria were observed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1676</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who discovered bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was he able to see bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">using a single-lens microscope of his own design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did it take for his discovery to be taken seriously?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over a century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Though it was known in the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available.

Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first antibiotic discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In 1910</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the creator of antibiotic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul Ehrlich</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bacteria did he treat first?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treponema pallidum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who based their research on Enrlich's stains works?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gram stain and the Ziehl–Neelsen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was his discovery aknowledged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
