He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in bodybuilding and has written many books and articles on the sport. He is widely considered to be among the greatest bodybuilders of all times as well as its biggest icon. Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit and resulted in a sequel. In 1984, he appeared in James Cameron's science-fiction thriller film The Terminator, which was a massive critical and box-office success. Schwarzenegger subsequently reprised the Terminator character in the franchise's later installments in 1991, 2003, and 2015. He appeared in a number of successful films, such as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Twins (1988), Total Recall (1990), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and True Lies (1994). He was nicknamed the &quot;Austrian Oak&quot; in his bodybuilding days, &quot;Arnie&quot; during his acting career, and &quot;The Governator&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Governor&quot; and &quot;The Terminator&quot;, one of his best-known movie roles).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Schwarzenegger when he started bodybuilding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was Schwarzenegger awarded the Mr. Olympia title?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which film from 1982 did Schwarzenegger first gain fame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Conan the Barbarian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Schwarzenegger when he won Mr. Universe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nickname did Schwarzenegger's co-stars call him by during his acting career?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arnie</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a Republican, he was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis.

His parents were Gustav Schwarzenegger (August 17, 1907 – December 13, 1972), and Aurelia Schwarzenegger (née Jadrny; July 29, 1922 – August 2, 1998). Gustav was the local chief of police, and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938, though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. He married Arnold's mother on October 20, 1945;– he was 38, and she was 23 years old. According to Schwarzenegger, both of his parents were very strict: &quot;Back then in Austria it was a very different world, if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.&quot; He grew up in a Roman Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country was Schwarzenegger born in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Schwarzenegger's mother's maiden name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jadrny</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Schwarzenegger's father's first name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gustav</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Schwarzenegger's dad's job in their town?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chief of police</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard (July 17, 1946 – May 20, 1971), over Arnold. His favoritism was &quot;strong and blatant,&quot; which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. Schwarzenegger has said his father had &quot;no patience for listening or understanding your problems.&quot; Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death. In later life, Schwarzenegger commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav's being involved in atrocities, despite Gustav's membership in the Nazi Party and SA. Schwarzenegger's father's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California recall campaign. At school, Schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle but stood out for his &quot;cheerful, good-humored and exuberant&quot; character. Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Schwarzenegger's older brother's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Meinhard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What appliance did Schwarzenegger's family buy that he called a highlight of his youth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">refrigerator</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: &quot;I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.&quot; However, his official website biography claims: &quot;At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.&quot; During a speech in 2001, he said, &quot;My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.&quot; Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: &quot;As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.&quot; In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. &quot;It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.&quot; When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: &quot;I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sport Schwarzenegger played led to a trip to the gym that sparked his love of weightlifting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soccer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who starred in the first movie Schwarzenegger remembers seeing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Wayne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What job did Schwarzenegger's father want him to pursue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">police officer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Schwarzenegger's bodybuilding idols died in 2000?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Steve Reeves</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On May 20, 1971, his brother, Meinhard, died in a car accident. Meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was due to marry Erika Knapp, and the couple had a three-year-old son, Patrick. Schwarzenegger would pay for Patrick's education and help him to emigrate to the United States. Gustav died the following year from a stroke. In Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image more cold and machine-like in order to fan controversy for the film. Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, has said he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Schwarzenegger's brother die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Meinhard's son named?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Patrick</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused Schwarzenegger's father Gustav's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stroke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first woman Schwarzenegger was serious about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barbara Baker</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In an interview with Fortune in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what &quot;would now be called child abuse&quot; at the hands of his father: &quot;My hair was pulled.

He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in military prison: &quot;Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.&quot; He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirer Hof Hotel (where he had placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous. &quot;The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America – the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.&quot; Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London.

As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Also in 1966, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title.
