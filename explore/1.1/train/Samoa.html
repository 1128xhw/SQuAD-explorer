The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on agriculture and fishing at the local level. In modern times, development aid, private family remittances from overseas, and agricultural exports have become key factors in the nation's economy. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labour force, and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, noni (juice of the nonu fruit, as it is known in Samoan), and copra.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What institution is in charge of Samoa's currency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Central Bank of Samoa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to agriculture, what industry historically supported Samoa's local economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fishing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What fruit juice is a major Samoan export?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">noni</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What portion of Samoa works in agriculture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two-thirds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of oil does Samoa export?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coconut</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Samoan government has called for deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline.[citation needed] Observers point to the flexibility of the labour market as a basic strength for future economic advances.[citation needed] The sector has been helped enormously by major capital investment in hotel infrastructure, political instability in neighbouring Pacific countries, and the 2005 launch of Virgin Samoa a joint-venture between the government and Virgin Australia (then Virgin Blue).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which sector would the government of Samoa like to see deregulation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">financial</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The flexibility of what segment could support economic growth in Samoa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the labour market</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What infrastructure has benefited greatly from capital investment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hotel infrastructure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's the name of the team-up between Samoa and Virgin Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Virgin Samoa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is Samoa helped or hurt by political upheaval in the countries around them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">helped</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the period before German colonisation, Samoa produced mostly copra.

If the rhinoceros beetle in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are Criollo-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven.
