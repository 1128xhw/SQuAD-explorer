Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States, brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Before that the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states. Today the term &quot;High Plains&quot; is used for a subregion of the Great Plains.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what is the name of the region east of the Rocky Mountains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Great Plains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who brought the term great plains into widespread usage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nevin Fenneman's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what year was Nevin Fenneman's study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1916</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what was theregion called before &quot;the great plans&quot;? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the High Plains</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Much of the Great Plains became open range, or rangeland where cattle roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. In 1866-95, cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as Dodge City, Kansas and Ogallala, Nebraska; from there, cattle were shipped eastward.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what type of land is much of the great plans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">open range</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">when did ranchers usually have a cattle round up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spring and fall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in a cattle round up, what did ranchers do to the new calves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">branded</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">from 1866-95 about how many cattle did cowboys herd?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the arrival of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, a Spanish conquistador, the first recorded history of encounter between Europeans and Native Americans in the Great Plains occurred in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska from 1540-1542.

In this context, the High Plains, as well as Southern Alberta, south-western Saskatchewan and Eastern Montana are mainly semi hot steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland. The region (especially the High Plains) is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought; high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms. The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas, and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what is the name of the line that divides the great plains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The 100th meridian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">about how much rainfall does the great plains get per year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 inches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what do high winds in the area sometimes cause?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dust storms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what type of climate does the eastern great plains fall into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humid subtropical climate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After 1870, the new railroads across the Plains brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides. The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to European farmers, who rushed to settle the land. They (and Americans as well) also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. In Kansas, for example, nearly 5000 towns were mapped out, but by 1970 only 617 were actually operating. In the mid-20th century, closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for business.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">after about what year did railroads bring hunters to the great plains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what animal did hunters kill off for their hides?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bison</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what farmers rushed in to settle the land with the help of the railroads?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European farmers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what did the railroads offer the farmers that rushed in to settle the area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">packages of land and transportation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The rural Plains have lost a third of their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles (several hundred thousand square kilometers) of the Great Plains have fewer than 6 inhabitants per square mile (2.3 inhabitants per square kilometer)—the density standard Frederick Jackson Turner used to declare the American frontier &quot;closed&quot; in 1893. Many have fewer than 2 inhabitants per square mile (0.77 inhabitants per square kilometer). There are more than 6,000 ghost towns in the state of Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable, and there has been a proposal - the &quot;Buffalo Commons&quot; - to return approximately 139,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of these drier parts to native prairie land.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">how much of the population have the rural plains lost since 1920? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who declated the American frontier &quot;closed&quot; in 1893?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frederick Jackson Turner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">how many ghost towns are in the state of Kansas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 6,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">how much prarie land does the &quot;Buffalo Commons&quot; want to return?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">139,000 square miles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife, plains residents created busy social lives for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees, Grange meetings, church activities and school functions. Women organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families. The Grange was a nationwide farmers' organization, they reserved high offices for women, and gave them a voice in public affairs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who usually organized shared meals and potluck events?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Women</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From the 1950s on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings.

Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling paperwork and financial details. During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping, and home economics courses in the schools.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what mainly opened the great plains for settlement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">railroads</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what did the railroads make it easy to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ship wheat and other crops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who did the railroads sell cheap lands to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">immigrants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who two new technologies were introducted in the 1930s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sewing and washing machines</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates and glires, that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked. However, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals, giving rise to the &quot;grit, not grass&quot; hypothesis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">about how long ago did the climate become favorable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 25 million years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what animals did the grasslands provide a new home for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mammals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what diet did the mammals switch to from browsing diets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grazing diets</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">the spread of grasslands and what have been strongly linked?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">development of grazers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To allow for agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population, the US passed the Homestead Acts of 1862: it allowed a settler to claim up to 160 acres (65 ha) of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the Kinkaid Act of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land. Many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent. Much of the Plains were settled during relatively wet years. Government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked[citation needed]. Germans from Russia who had previously farmed, under similar circumstances, in what is now Ukraine were marginally more successful than other homesteaders. The Dominion Lands Act of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">when did the US pass the Homestead ACt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1862</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">how much land did the Homestead Act allow a person to claim?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up to 160 acres</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">how long did the person have to live on the land?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">when was the Kinkaid Act brought about? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1904</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">the dominion act was passed in what year</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1871</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
