These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, escort carriers were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of merchant aircraft carriers, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. Light aircraft carriers were carriers that were fast enough to operate with the fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity. Soviet aircraft carriers now in use by Russia are actually called heavy aviation cruisers, these ships while sized in the range of large fleet carriers were designed to deploy alone or with escorts and provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser in addition to supporting fighters and helicopters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of carrier is the largest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fleet carrier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What capability does a fleet carrier offer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">offensive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What purpose were excort carriers developed for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to provide defense for convoys of ships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were most escort carriers built from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mercantile hulls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the soviet aircraft carriers used by Russia actually called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heavy aviation cruisers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This new-found importance of naval aviation forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage required the construction of several new 'light' carriers. Escort aircraft carriers, such as USS Bogue, were sometimes purpose-built, but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Following this concept, light aircraft carriers built by the US, such as USS Independence, represented a larger, more &quot;militarized&quot; version of the escort carrier. Although with similar complement to Escort carriers, they had the advantage of speed from their converted cruiser hulls. The UK 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier was designed for building quickly by civilian shipyards and with an expected service life of about 3 years. They served the Royal Navy during the war and was the hull design chosen for nearly all aircraft carrier equipped navies after the war until the 1980s. Emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft carriers. CAM ships, were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch (but not retrieve) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend the convoy from long range German aircraft.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of aircraft carrier was the USS Bogue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Escort</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of aircraft was the USS Independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What advantage did light carriers have over escort carriers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">speed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the expected serice life of the UK 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the UK 1941 Design Light Fleet Carriers serve during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Navy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Speaking in St. Petersburg, Russia on 30 June 2011, the head of Russia's United Shipbuilding Corporation said his company expected to begin design work for a new carrier in 2016, with a goal of beginning construction in 2018 and having the carrier achieve initial operational capability by 2023.

Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects take-off procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are typically regarded as &quot;runways at sea&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aircraft carriers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What design feature do aircraft carriers feature to aid in launching and recovering aircraft?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flat-top flight deck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The flight deck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a primary reason that ships have shorter runways than land runways have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do aircraft need to do when using shorter runway lengths?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">accelerate more quickly to gain lift</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a bolter, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck allows the installation of one or two &quot;waist&quot; catapults in addition to the two bow cats.

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are ski-jump ramps located on aircraft carriers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the forward end of the flight deck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did ski-jump ramps allow STOVL aircraft to do that they couldn't do with a flat deck??</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">take off at far higher weights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who originally developed the ski-jump ramp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Royal Navy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a ski-jump ramp convert in order to be successful?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the ski-jump ramp prevent a fully loaded and fueled aircraft from doing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft.

On 9 May 1912 the first airplane take-off from a ship underway was made from the deck of the British Royal Navy's HMS Hibernia. Seaplane tender support ships came next, with the French Foudre of 1911. In September 1914 the Imperial Japanese Navy Wakamiya conducted the world's first successful ship-launched air raid: on 6 September 1914 a Farman aircraft launched by Wakamiya attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth and the German gunboat Jaguar in Kiaochow Bay off Tsingtao; neither was hit.

Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance. Supercarriers, displacing 75,000 tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Some are powered by nuclear reactors and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home.

Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually led to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to &quot;bolt&quot; and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do almost all carriers using conventional aircraft have arrested-recovery systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conventional aircraft cannot decelerate on their own</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of an arrested-recovery system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to recover their aircraft</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do aircraft do when landing in order to stop on a short distance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">extend a tailhook that catches on arrestor wires stretched across the deck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a landing area angles off access allow an aircraft to do if if misses the arresting wires?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bolt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can a &quot;bolt&quot; prevent an aircraft from doing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">crashing into aircraft on the forward deck</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Key personnel involved in the flight deck include the shooters, the handler, and the air boss.

The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dramatically changed naval combat in World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The aircraft carrier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What drove the advent of carrier-launched aircraft as focal weapons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were carrier-launched aircraft more effective than naval guns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">They had higher range and precision</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was signalled in 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched an strike on an Italian fleet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event showed the vulnerability of carriers when forced into gun-range enounters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships.

As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships. These conversions gave rise to the Lexington-class aircraft carriers (1927), Akagi and Courageous class. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s, resulting in the commissioning of ships such as Hōshō (1922), HMS Hermes (1924), and Béarn (1927).

It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area.

In addition, lack of an island meant difficulties managing the flight deck, performing air traffic control, a lack of radar housing placements and problems with navigating and controlling the ship itself.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What feature was pioneered on the HMS Hermes in 1923?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an island</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is concentrated in the small area called an island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The superstructure of a carrier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than Japanese carriers, which side of the flight deck are islands typically built on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">starboard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the biggest drawback to the flush deck configuration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">management of the exhaust from the power plant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a major issue in the USS Langley?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fumes coming across the deck</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>1 CATOBAR carrier: Charles de Gaulle is a 42,000 tonne nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2001 and is the flagship of the French Navy (Marine Nationale).
