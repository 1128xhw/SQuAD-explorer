De Rerum Natura provides mechanistic explanations for phenomena such as erosion, evaporation, wind, and sound. Famous principles like &quot;nothing can touch body but body&quot; first appeared in the works of Lucretius.

Matter can be argued to be redundant, as in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If you believe in idealism, you are disbeliving in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">materialism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>If matter and energy are seen as necessary to explain the physical world, but incapable of explaining mind, dualism results.
