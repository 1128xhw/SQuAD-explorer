There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The members of what class were priests in ancient Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which God exemplified just rule for the Romans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jupiter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the time span of the Roman Republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">509–27 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of political separation did not exist in Rome? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">church and state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As a result of what war were many new temples built by victorious generals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Punic Wars</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Roman religion was thus practical and contractual, based on the principle of do ut des, &quot;I give that you might give.&quot; Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What characteristics were not inherent in Roman religious practice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">faith or dogma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was brought forth by religion in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social order</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religious feature did each Roman home have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">household shrine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of celebrations made up the Roman calendar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious observances</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religious group was in charge of Rome's sacred flame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vestals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists.

The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art.

The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of &quot;magic&quot;, conspiratorial (coniuratio), or subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity, as with the senate's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the practice of religion to the Romans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">personal choice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the standard practice in Roman religious life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">public religion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of Roman religious practice involved secrecy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mysteries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group viewed the mysteries as suspicious or subversive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conservative Romans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the mysteries seem to threaten that made the Romans occasionally attempt to ban them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">morality and unity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them, since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability. One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces, among them Cybele, Isis, Epona, and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict. For example, religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To the Romans what did them think promoted social stability?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">preserving tradition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Romans tend to do with local religions and deities in conquered areas? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">absorb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What facet of religion was not an issue for Roman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tolerance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what areas of the Roman empire did the Romans take their deities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">remote provinces</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What facet of a foreign people did Rome add to itself to promote order?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious heritage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the wake of the Republic's collapse, state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called &quot;emperor worship&quot; expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius, the divine tutelary of every individual. Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome's conflict with Christianity, which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the Republic collapsed,  what addition was made to the religions of Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emperors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first Roman emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Augustus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For whose well being were public vows made in the empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emperor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Romans use as a means of expanding their rule throughout the empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Imperial cult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As what during the time of the Roman empire  was rejection of the state religion viewed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">treason</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas, son of Venus, who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium, Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy.

Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander, a Greek exile from Arcadia, to whom were attributed other religious foundations: he established the Ara Maxima, &quot;Greatest Altar,&quot; to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium, and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia, an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mythical figure did the Romans consider to be semi-divine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aeneas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what did Aeneas establish the central feature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman religion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the keepers of Aeneas's sacred objects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vestals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ancient festival was celebrated until the 5th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lupercalia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom did Aeneas set up an alter in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hercules</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy (the Latin kings of Alba Longa) with the well-known legend of Rome's founding by Romulus and Remus.

Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien. The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults.

Jupiter, the most powerful of all gods and &quot;the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested&quot;, consistently personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization and external relations. During the archaic and early Republican eras, he shared his temple, some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus, who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva. A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres, Liber and Libera, and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult. Other major and minor deities could be single, coupled, or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure. These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic, part philosophical creations, and often Greek in origin. The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians, and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To the Romans who was the most powerful of the gods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jupiter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Jupiter personify in regards to Rome's highest offices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">divine authority</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What gods did Juno and Minerva replace in Roman religious practice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mars and Quirinus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where does the practice of linking various gods into grouping come?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek in origin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what did the linking of Greek and Roman deities promote a feeling? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heritage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The impressive, costly, and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual's domestic and personal deities, the patron divinities of Rome's various neighborhoods and communities, and the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion.

Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi (&quot;games,&quot; such as chariot races and theatrical performances), with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia, and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber. Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes, or particular groups, such as women at the Bona Dea rites.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many religious celebrations did Rome have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">forty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What type of day were there more of in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sacred days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what were Roman festivals organized in accordance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seasonal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What traditions did the seasonal festivals incorporate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">local</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of the public, what did some religious rites only require?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">particular groups</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Other public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of festivals happened when events warranted them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fulfillment of religious vows</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of an event organized religious celebration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The triumph</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what aspect of the festival did political figures try to out do each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">public display</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under what auspices did public displays  come during the Principate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Imperial</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who paid for the most lavish of festival events?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emperors</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome's intellectual elite, but the more obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, Ovid. In his Fasti, a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia, Consualia, and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March, where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people. But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did obscure festivals offer Romans the opportunity to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reinterpretation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Augustus wish to do for Roman religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reform</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What poet wrote a long poem describing Roman religious holidays?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ovid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was lacking in the presentation of religious events in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">authoritative calendar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under whose rule were new Christian festivals added to previous Roman holidays?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself, but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury: &quot;The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual.&quot; The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct, and the more common Latin words aedes, delubrum, or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building.

Pliny the Elder declared that &quot;a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods.&quot; Prayer by itself, however, had independent power. The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action, and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy. Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked, hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities. Public prayers (prex) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community. Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start. The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the &quot;Roman people&quot; among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer; the festival had to be started over. Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic, a recitation rather than a personal expression, though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did each offering require to be valid in Roman religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prayer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Pliny the Elder think that a sacrifice without prayer was?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">useless</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What act alone had power in Roman thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prayer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was missing in the formulas of prayer in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">personal expression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What knowledge was of importance in the potency of prayer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">correct verbal formulas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sacrifice to deities of the heavens (di superi, &quot;gods above&quot;) was performed in daylight, and under the public gaze.

Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation. In household cult, the paterfamilias functioned as priest, and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants. Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise. The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines (the singular is flamen), attributed to king Numa: the major flamines, dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, were traditionally drawn from patrician families. Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity, whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some. Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity; Jupiter's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was lacking as to the profession of a priest class in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">separate priestly caste</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What authority in a community sponsored religious rites? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">highest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of religious participants were available for consultation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Specialists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the earliest priesthoods? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flamines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which member of a family functioned as priest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paterfamilias</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Regal era, a rex sacrorum (king of the sacred rites) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king (rex) or in his absence, and announced the public festivals.

Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group selected public priests in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">collegia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the term of office for a priest in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lifetime</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What limited an individual's access to religious offices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Because of the lack of pay, what was the type of honor in being a priest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">costly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a priesthood in the Imperial cult gain a provencial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman citizenship</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta, goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame.

The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this sacred space, and only later referred to a building. Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary (pomerium) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state. In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) and the pomerium. Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before, during and after an act of sacrifice. Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (vitium) or an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (ius augurum) to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic. By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices, whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what area did public rites take place in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sacred precinct</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What person marked the religious area ritually?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">augur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original meaning of the templum in Latin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sacred space</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who designated the first boundary of Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romulus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did augers seek to understand through observances?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">divine will</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Haruspicy was also used in public cult, under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate.

Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient, ethnically Etruscan &quot;outsider&quot; religious profession, separate from Rome's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy, essential but never quite respectable. During the mid-to-late Republic, the reformist Gaius Gracchus, the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla, and the &quot;notorious Verres&quot; justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners. The senate and armies used the public haruspices: at some time during the late Republic, the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination. Being of independent means, they would be better motivated to maintain a pure, religious practice for the public good.

Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods. As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name. Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial, with such grave goods as relatives could afford.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what source does information of Roman thought about the afterlife come?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">educated elite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of practices were those affecting the care of the dead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">archaic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the ancient Romans expect after death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">afterlife</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With whom did the  early Romans expect to associate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gods</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did later Romans invest in rather than grave offerings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monumental endowments</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth, status and religious context. In Cicero's time, the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the less well-off, inhumation with &quot;a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient&quot;. Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld. They had become one of the di Manes, who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia, a multi-day festival of remembrance in February.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of rites varied in accordance with status and religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Funeral and commemorative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the grave sacrifice in Cicero's time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What class gave only wine and food as a grave offering?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">less well-off</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the multi day of remembrance for the dead? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parentalia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What goddess was an intermediary  between the dead and the living?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ceres</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the later Imperial era, the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped. Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members, and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica. The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the &quot;drunken&quot; practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to &quot;new life&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group's burial practices over-lapped with the Roman's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What items were shared among Christian and non- Christians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tombs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did St Augustine believe that funeral feasts gave an opportunity for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alms of food</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Christian attendance at Parentalia become forbidden by the Christians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">AD 567</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the Romans view the corpse of the dead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ritual pollution</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual; in effect they were Rome in miniature. The commander's headquarters stood at the centre; he took the auspices on a dais in front. A small building behind housed the legionary standards, the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era, the image of the ruling emperor. In one camp, this shrine is even called Capitolium. The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major, set battle. A ram, a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded, led around the outer perimeter of the camp (a lustratio exercitus) and in through a gate, then sacrificed: Trajan's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars. The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum; all within are purified and protected.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were Roman camps laid out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">standard pattern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what purpose were Roman camps arranged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">defense and religious ritual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what were Roman camps diminutive versions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rome</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was in the center of each Roman camp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">commander's headquarters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the religious rites performed before battle suggest that the camp has become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">divine templum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Each camp had its own religious personnel; standard bearers, priestly officers and their assistants, including a haruspex, and housekeepers of shrines and images.

As in Rome, whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods, personal deities and deities otherwise unknown. From the earliest Imperial era, citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions, anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows. They celebrated Rome's official festivals in absentia, and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire, Jupiter, Victoria and Concordia were typical. By the early Severan era, the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi, the current emperor's numen, genius and domus (or familia), and special cult to the Empress as &quot;mother of the camp.&quot; The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of personnel did every camp have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What officer headed the religious personnel of a Roman camp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">senior magistrate-commander</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the Imperial era, what cult did legionnaires follow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emperor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Even in other places, of what did the legions keep observance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rome's official festivals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What person was considered to be &quot;Mother of the camp''?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Empress</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The devotio was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make, promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods. Livy offers a detailed account of the devotio carried out by Decius Mus; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson, all bearing the same name, also devoted themselves. Before the battle, Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate. When he offers sacrifice, the victim's liver appears &quot;damaged where it refers to his own fortunes&quot;. Otherwise, the haruspex tells him, the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods. In a prayer recorded by Livy, Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus, charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering. Had he failed to die, his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void, with possibly disastrous consequences.

Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias.

Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect. So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit, subversive or magical purposes. Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times, notably in 139 BC and 33 BC. In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death. &quot;Egyptian rites&quot; were particularly suspect: Augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19.

Similar traditions existed throughout the empire, persisting until around the 7th century AD, well into the Christian era.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What science has confirmed the existence of magic use from early times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Archaeology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the term for binding spells in the Roman world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">defixiones</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the elite use instead of spells and potions to redress a wrong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">law and justice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Until what era did spells persist in the empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7th century AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What era produced a decline in the use of spells?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian era</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Rome's government, politics and religion were dominated by an educated, male, landowning military aristocracy.

However, all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices, in the name of the senate and people of Rome. &quot;In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine, just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What male group dominated all aspects of Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aristocracy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what class was more than half of Rome's population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">slave or free non-citizens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the lowest class of Roman citizens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plebeians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many adult males were able to vote in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Less than a quarter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization was Rome's official caretaker?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the senate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome's internal governance, diplomacy and development from kingdom, to Republic and to Empire. Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia. The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians. In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The link between what groups was necessary to Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious and political</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the basic power in Rome to be found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">patrician elite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group was excluded from high offices ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plebeians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Senate select to settle a strike by the lower classes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Camillus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom was a temple dedicated at the settlement of the strike?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Concordia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults.

Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship.

Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation. In 63 BC, Julius Caesar's appointment as pontifex maximus &quot;signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics&quot;. Likewise, political candidates could sponsor temples, priesthoods and the immensely popular, spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic.

In the last century of the Republic, Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, Scaevola and the polymath Varro. For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with.

He was not a living divus but father of his country (pater patriae), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a divus, he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the emperor's rule in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">divinely approved</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As a living divus, what was the emperor to Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">father of his country</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As first citizen, what must the emperor's mores represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">traditional</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After his death, how was the emperor's afterlife decided?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vote in the Senate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did emperors before Diocletian try to guarantee in religion? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">traditional cults</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate, Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea's Hellenised elite. Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them. Early Italian synagogues have left few traces; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period. Judaea's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora; in Rome, this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion. Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by Julius Caesar. By the Augustan era, the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews. In some periods under Roman rule, Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice, under certain conditions. Judaism was a superstitio to Cicero, but the Church Father Tertullian described it as religio licita (an officially permitted religion) in contrast to Christianity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What means guaranteed the Jews and Judaism in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">treaty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Judea become an allied kingdom to Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">63 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religious buildings were established in Rome in the imperial period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">synagogues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who recognized the Jewish synagogues as being legitimate in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Julius Caesar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In contrast to what religion was Judaism acceptable in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats, who were later persecuted and killed. From that point on, Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution. During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century, “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms”, regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless, who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State, and therefore threatened its existence. The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework.

The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman.

His second edict acknowledged a Christian threat to the Imperial system – not yet at its heart but close to it, among Rome’s equites and Senators. Christian apologists interpreted his disgraceful capture and death as divine judgement. The next forty years were peaceful; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile, due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence. Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius' predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a “pagan” basis in Christian heresies. The Christian churches were disunited; Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 for &quot;dogmatic reasons – his doctrine on the human nature of Christ was rejected – and for his lifestyle, which reminded his brethren of the habits of the administrative elite&quot;. The reasons for his deposition were widely circulated among the churches. Meanwhile, Aurelian (270-75) appealed for harmony among his soldiers (concordia militum), stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official, Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene Sol Invictus in Rome's Campus Martius.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did  Valerian call the Christian religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subversive foreign cult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Christian events did Valerian outlaw?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">assemblies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what gods did Valerian tell the Christians to sacrifice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rome's traditional</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Valerian's second edict call the Christians' presence in the empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">threat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Christian church become in the years after Valerian's death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stronger</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 295, a certain Maximilian refused military service; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath.
