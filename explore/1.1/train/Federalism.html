Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established. It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is federalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mode of government, combining a general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What features are distinctive of federalism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a relationship of parity between the two levels of government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is federlism defined as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What document exemplified modern federalist government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constitution of 1789</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What distinguishes Federalism from other types of government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is the division of power among different levels of government equal in a Federalist government? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Federalism combines what two types of government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is federalism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federalism refers to the mixed or compound mode of government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Federalism, are the division of powers equal? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">division of powers between two levels of government of equal status</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of governments are included in federalism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many governments are apart of federalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relationship of parity between the two levels of government</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Until recently, in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition, the concept was thought to mean (as a shorthand) 'a division of sovereignty between two levels of government'. New research, however, argues that this cannot be correct, as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible. The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century, over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession, showed this. One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government'. What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established. This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples): the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union), respectively. Leading examples of the federal state include the United States, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and India. The leading example of the federal union of states is the European Union.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What distinguishes Federalism from other multi-level governments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">equality of standing between the two levels of government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What historical event illustrated that dividing sovereignty was not possible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Civil War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization is a leading example of a federal union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What form of Federalism is characterized by where sovereignty resides in the whole?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">federal state (or federation)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">New research has clarified that Federalism has how many distinct forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two distinct federal forms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before new research, what was the definition of federalism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a division of sovereignty between two levels of government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After new research, what was the final definition of federalism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was federalism put into place? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the difference between multi-level political forms and federalism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a federal union? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the European Union</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the Latin word foedus, meaning treaty, pact or covenant. Their common meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms. It was in this sense that James Madison in Federalist 39 had referred to the new United States as 'neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both' (ie. neither a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a hybrid of the two). In the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form, while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states. Thus, this article relates to the modern usage of the word 'federalism'.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Latin word for federalism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">foedus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was federalism and confederalism common meaning in the 18th century? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did James Madison referred to the new United States as? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">'neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Whilst it is often perceived as an optimal solution for states comprising different cultural or ethnic communities, the federalist model seems to work best in largely homogeneous states such as the United States, Germany or Australia, but there is also evidence to the contrary such as in Switzerland.

This is very different from the modern usage of &quot;federalism&quot; in Europe and the United States. The distinction stems from the fact that &quot;federalism&quot; is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a confederacy and a unitary state.

When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the Federation of Australia commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.

The 1937 Constitution, for example, granted the federal government the authority to appoint State Governors (called interventors) at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of President Getúlio Vargas.

Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municípios) with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a &quot;little constitution&quot;, called &quot;organic law&quot; (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, &quot;free municipality&quot;) is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is a federation formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two levels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two levels equal a federation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the central government and the regions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is Brazil an exception?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is each state divided into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">municipalities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does each state have their own of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>China is the largest unitary state in the world by both population and land area.

Instead of adopting a federal model, the UK has relied on gradual devolution to decentralise political power. Devolution in the UK began with the Government of Ireland Act 1914 which granted home rule to Ireland as a constituent country of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the partition of Ireland in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign Irish Free State (which eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland), Northern Ireland retained its devolved government through the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK to have such a body at this time. This body was suspended in 1972 and Northern Ireland was governed by direct rule during the period of conflict known as The Troubles.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How has United Kingdom been governed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unitary state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of the UK adopting the federalist model, what did they do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UK has relied on gradual devolution to decentralise political power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did devolution in the UK begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Ireland Act 1914?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">which granted home rule to Ireland as a constituent country of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Irish Free State?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In modern times, a process of devolution in the United Kingdom has decentralised power once again.

Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to presbyteries and further to a general assembly. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members. In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself.

In their arguments, this is particularly demonstrated in the Council of Jerusalem, described in Acts chapter 15, where the Apostles and elders gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church.

Notably, the states of Germany retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the Kingdom of Bavaria's agreement to join the German Empire in 1871. Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another. The constitutions of Germany and the United States provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like Canada and India, on the other hand, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility. Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state as concurrent powers are retained by the constituent states.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In nearly all federalism countries, central powers enjoy what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the powers of foreign policy and national defense as exclusive federal powers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Per the UN definition, what is federalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">federation would not be a single sovereign state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the German Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the libson treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state as concurrent powers are retained by the constituent states.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
