A series of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed  along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today (what is now the Kromme Rijn). These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers.

The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, bishop of the Frisians. The tenure of Willibrordus is generally considered to be the beginning of the Bishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The archbishops of Utrecht were based at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian Empire. In addition, the city of Utrecht had competition from the nearby trading centre Dorestad. After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands. The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522 (the last non-Italian pope before John Paul II).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to convert Frisians</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the pope appoint Bishop</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, bishop of the Frisians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Charles Martel do </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Utrecht gain in power </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What showed the importance of Utrecht</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops. The territory of the bishopric not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht'), but also extended to the northeast. The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht. The prince-bishopric was involved in almost continuous conflicts with the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders. The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What hapend when Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was part of the territory of bishopric </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht'), but also extended to the northeast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What conflict affected Utrecht</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was in conflict with the prince bishopric </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What region was seized </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Several churches and monasteries were built inside, or close to, the city of Utrecht. The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower. The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished. Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator's Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century. Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039 and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives). Besides these churches the city housed St. Paul's Abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Most dominant Cathedral in Utrecht</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What began in 1254 </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was the cathedral finished </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many collegiate churches existed in Utecht besides the cathedral</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What else was housed in the city </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the city housed St. Paul's Abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town Utrecht was granted city rights by Henry V in 1122. When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed, which still flowed through the heart of the town became evermore canalized; and the wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system. On the wharfs storage facilities (werfkelders) were built, on top of which the main street, including houses was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure.[nb 2] The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy. The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel at IJsselstein.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Utrecht's location allow </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who granted Utrecht city rights </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry V in 1122</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the relationship with the bishop like for citizens of Utrecht</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Industry did the bishop hurt </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht – which included the city of Utrecht – to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V combined the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France) as a personal union. This ended the prince-bishopric Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the lordship of Utrecht, with the religious power remaining with the bishop, although Charles V had gained the right to appoint new bishops. In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious center of the Northern ecclesiastical province in the Seventeen provinces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the bishop lose power </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht – which included the city of Utrecht – to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Charles V combine </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles V combined the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France) as a personal union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the loss of power end </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the prince-bishopric Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the lordship of Utrecht, with the religious power remaining with the bishop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the bishop of Utrecht raised to </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious center of the Northern ecclesiastical province in the Seventeen provinces</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The transition from independence to a relatively minor part of a larger union was not easily accepted.

The heavily fortified castle Vredenburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city.

The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht. Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was signed in 1579 </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is this union seen as </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What became the dominant province </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">towards its dominant province Holland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the state of Utrecht </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The fortified city temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year); where the French invasion was only stopped west of Utrecht at the Old Hollandic Waterline.

The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of St Martin church which collapsed; creating the current Dom square between the tower and choir. In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession.

The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What hapend in the early 19th century</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1843 what brought growth to Utrecht </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was reinstated in 1853 </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what was built in the 1920's and 1930's </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The area surrounding Utrecht Centraal railway station and the station itself were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a brutalist style.

Boroughs such as Kanaleneiland, Overvecht and Hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments, and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Socio economic problems does Utrecht face </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">About 38% percent of its population either earns a minimum income or is dependent on social welfare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">percentage of population that's dutch </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">About 69% of the population is of Dutch ancestry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What boroughs are known for high crime </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kanaleneiland, Overvecht and Hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments, and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Utrecht is the centre of a densely populated area, which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary.

Because of the role of Utrecht as a fortified city, construction outside the medieval centre and its city walls was restricted until the 19th century. Surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th- and early 20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out. The eastern part of Utrecht remains fairly open.
