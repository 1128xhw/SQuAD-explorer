Its major appliance manufacturing plant &quot;Appliance Park&quot; was the first non-governmental site to host one. However, in 1970, GE sold its computer division to Honeywell, exiting the computer manufacturing industry, though it retained its timesharing operations for some years afterwards. GE was a major provider of computer timesharing services, through General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS), offering online computing services that included GEnie.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which decade did GE start manufacuring computers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of GE's major appliance manufacturing plant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Appliance Park</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did GE sell its computer division to Honeywell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What division of GE provides computer timesharing services?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GXS</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of first business in the world to own a computer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GE</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During 1889, Thomas Edison had business interests in many electricity-related companies: Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; Edison Machine Works, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; Bergmann &amp; Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and Edison Electric Light Company, the patent-holding company and the financial arm backed by J.P.

Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II, and GE was the world leader in exhaust-driven supercharging when the war started. This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the Whittle W.1 jet engine that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941. GE ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

A rival joint bid was submitted in June 2014 by Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) with Siemens seeking to acquire Alstom's gas turbine business for €3.9 billion, and MHI proposing a joint venture in steam turbines, plus a €3.1 billion cash investment. In June 2014 a formal offer From GE worth $17 billion was agreed by the Alstom board. Part of the transaction involved the French government taking a 20% stake in Alstom to help secure France's energy and transport interests, and French jobs. A rival offer from Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was rejected. The acquisition was expected to be completed in 2015.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did GE announce it was in talks to acquire the French engineering group Alstom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the final acquisition price paid by GE for Alstom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$17 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How big was the stake in Alstom taken by the French government as part of the acquisition deal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was GE's acquisition of Alstom agreed to by Alstom's board?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From which company did the Alstom board reject a rival acquisition proposal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>GE is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Fairfield, Connecticut.
