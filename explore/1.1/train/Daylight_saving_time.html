In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST's proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer's day. An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on 12 February 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What particular kind of scientist was George Hudson?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">entomologist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did George Hudson spend time collecting when he wasn't working?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">insects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Hudson first present his two-hour daylight saving theory to the Wellington Philosophical Society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1895</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some people believe it wasn't Hudson who created DST, but an Englishman by what name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Willett</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the member of Parliament who brought a bill about Daylight Saving Time to the House of Commons in 1908?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Pearce</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Starting on 30 April 1916, Germany and its World War I ally Austria-Hungary were the first to use DST (German: Sommerzeit) as a way to conserve coal during wartime.

In some cases only part of a country shifts; for example, in the US, Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe DST.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which time zone in Europe always has a one-hour lead on Central European Time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eastern European Time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For one hour each spring, how far ahead of Pacific Time is Mountain Time in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two hours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2008, what month and day did Western Australia change their clocks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 26</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At DST in the fall, how long does it stay the same time in both Pacific and Mountain time in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one hour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to much of the state of Arizona, what U.S. state does not ever change their clocks for DST?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hawaii</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Start and end dates vary with location and year.

The 2007 US change was part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right to go back to the previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done.

The US was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few US cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York.

In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to US DST.

DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland State election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed.

Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise.

Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results.

It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts.

See British Double Summer Time and Central European Midsummer Time for details.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Places like Spain and parts of France effectively go by DST in the winter but add what in the summer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an extra hour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the summer in Nome, about how many hours ahead of the sun do they set their clocks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term was used in Britain for double daylight saving time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Double Summer Time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's a third name for double daylight saving time or Double Summer Time used in Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Central European Midsummer Time</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
