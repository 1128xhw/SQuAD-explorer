It is the third largest desert after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its surface area of 9,400,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi)[citation needed]—including the Libyan Desert—is comparable to the respective land areas of China or the United States. The desert comprises much of the land found within North Africa, excluding the fertile coastal region situated against the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley of Egypt and Sudan. The Sahara stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north, to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually transitions to a coastal plain. To the south, it is delimited by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert. Its name is derived from the plural Arabic language word for desert (صحارى ṣaḥārā  [ˈsˤɑħɑːrɑː]).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the third hottest desert in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Sahara</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the third largest desert in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Sahara</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the surface area of the Sahara Desert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9,400,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the hottest desert in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sahara</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The central part of the Sahara is hyperarid, with little to no vegetation.

The stability of the atmosphere above the desert prevents any convective overturning, thus making rainfall virtually non-existent. As a consequence, the weather tends to be sunny, dry and stable with a minimal risk of rainfall. Subsiding, diverging, dry air masses associated with subtropical high-pressure systems are extremely unfavorable for the development of convectional showers. The subtropical ridge is the predominate factor that explains the hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) of this vast region. The lowering of air is the strongest and the most effective over the eastern part of the Great Desert, in the Libyan Desert which is the sunniest, the driest and the most nearly rainless place on the planet rivaling the Atacama Desert, lying in Chile and Peru.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What allows unhindered light and thermal radiation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dissolution of clouds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What weather is virtually non-existent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rainfall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the air the strongest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eastern part of the Great Desert</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The rainfall inhibition and the dissipation of cloud cover are most accentuated over the eastern section of the Sahara rather than the western. The prevailing air mass lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert during most of the year. Because of this extreme heating process, a thermal low is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The Sahara High represents the eastern continental extension of the Azores High, centered over the North Atlantic Ocean.

Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by his geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme aridity of the Sahara can't be only explained by the subtropical high pressure. The Atlas Mountains, found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is blocked due to local surface low pressure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">air ascent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mountain helps enhance the aridity of the desert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atlas Mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the Atlas Mountains located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Algeria</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The primary source of rain in the Sahara is the equatorial low a continuous belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief, short and irregular rainy season to the Sahel and the southern Sahara.

Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation. The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by extremely low, unreliable, highly erratic rainfall; extremely high sunshine duration values; high temperatures year-round; negligible rates of relative humidity, a significant diurnal temperature variation and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the primary source of rain in the Sahara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">low-pressure systems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the reason the Sahara lacks moisture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lack of a precipitation-generating mechanism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the desert have to overcome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the temperature like year around in the desert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high temperatures year-round</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert enjoys more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time, and the highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production. The constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide and certainly the hottest place on Earth during summertime in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds 38 °C (100.4 °F) - 40 °C (104 °F) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high mountainous areas. The highest officially recorded average high temperature was 47 °C (116.6 °F) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters above sea level. It's the world's highest recorded average high temperature and only Death Valley, California rivals it. Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 meters above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46 °C (114.8 °F) during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has an average high temperature of 43.8 °C (110.8 °F), 46.4 °C (115.5 °F), 45.5 (113.9 °F). Furthermore, 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) in June, July, August and September. In fact, there are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around 3 – 5 months when the average high strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F). The southern central part of the desert experiences up to 6 – 7 months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F) which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this are Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F) everywhere and can approach 30 °C (86 °F) in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of 25 °C (77 °F). The sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach 80 °C (176 °F) or more. A sand temperature of 83.5 °C (182.3 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan. Ground temperatures of 72 °C (161.6 °F) have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75 °C (167 °F) has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad. Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it's a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 °C (55.4 °F) and 20 °C (68 °F). The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10 °C (50 °F), while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it's true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the largest hottest continuously large area   worldwide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Great Desert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the value temperature of most of the desert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25 °C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of time is the sun generally over most of the   desert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">82% of the time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the annual average direct solar irradiation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During daytime how high can the temperatures reach?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">80 °C (176 °F)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part. The thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front, although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm (3,93 in) to 250 mm (9,84 in). For example, Biskra, Algeria and Ouarzazate, Morocco are found in this zone. The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm (3,93 in) to 250 mm (9,84 in). For example, Timbuktu, Mali and Agadez, Niger are found in this zone. The vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 mm (0.04 in). In fact, most of the Sahara receives less than 20 mm (0.79 in). Of the 9,000,000 km2 of desert land in the Sahara, an area of about 2,800,000 km2 (about 31% of the total area) receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 mm (0.39 in) or less, while some 1,500,000 km2 (about 17% of the total area) receive an average of 5 mm or less. The annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1,000,000 km2 in the eastern Sahara comprising deserts of Libya, Egypt and Sudan (Tazirbu, Kufra, Dakhla, Kharga, Farafra, Siwa, Asyut, Sohag, Luxor, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Wadi Halfa) where the long-term mean approximates 0.5 mm per year. The rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the Sahara as it may vary considerably year by year. In full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts, the annual rates of potential evaporation are extraordinarily high, roughly ranging from 2,500 mm/year to more than 6,000 mm/year in the whole desert. Nowhere else on Earth has air been found as dry and evaporative as in the Sahara region. With such an evaporative power, the Sahara can only be desiccated and dried out further more and the moisture deficit is tremendous.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the reason the northern fringe receives more   cloudiness and rainfall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">low pressure systems</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average rainfall of the Sahara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">less than 1 mm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much desert land is the Sahara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9,000,000 km2 of desert land</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes the southern fringe to receive cloudiness and   rainfall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Intertropical Convergence Zone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south.

Fossils of dinosaurs, including Afrovenator, Jobaria and Ouranosaurus, have also been found here. The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the Nile Valley, at a few oases, and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow. It was long believed that the region had been this way since about 1600 BCE, after shifts in the Earth's axis increased temperatures and decreased precipitation. However, this theory has recently been called into dispute, when samples taken from several 7 million year old sand deposits led scientists to reconsider the timeline for desertification.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did people start living on the edge of the desert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ice age</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many river animals were thought to be found during   the ice age era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Over 30,000 petroglyphs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area of the Sahara is full of vegetation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Nile Valley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is believed to have increased temperatures in the   Sahara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shifts in the Earth's axis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Neolithic Era, before the onset of desertification, around 9500 BCE the central Sudan had been a rich environment supporting a large population ranging across what is now barren desert, like the Wadi el-Qa'ab.

The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves (which were put to work extending the tunnels). The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with the Garamantes, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes capital of Garama.

The legacy of the French colonial era administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the Third and Fourth republics, which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region. Diplomacy with local clients was primarily conducted in Arabic, which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs. Mediation of disputes and inter-agency communication was served by interpreters contracted by the French government, who, according to Keenan, &quot;documented a space of intercultural mediation,&quot; contributing much to preserving indigenous cultural identities in the region.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common dialect spoken in the Sahara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arabic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language is mainly spoken in West Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the traditional language of Bureaucratic affairs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arabic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
