Standing on the River Thames in the south eastern part of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London,[note 1] a region of England governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[note 2] The conurbation also covers two English counties: the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London. The latter constitutes the vast majority of London, though historically it was split between Middlesex (a now abolished county), Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city is the capital of England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the city of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Romans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of 2011, what was the population of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7,375</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of London constitutes the bulk of the city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">county of Greater London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When founded by the Romans, what was the name they gave the city of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Londinium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of 2011 what was the population of the core of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7,375</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what river is London situated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">River Thames</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was London's original name, as founded by the Romans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Londinium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bodies govern Greater London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Mayor of London and the London Assembly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the approximate area of the core of the City of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>London is a leading global city, with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transport all contributing to its prominence.

It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London is one of the world's leading investment destinations, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe, and a 2014 report placed it first in the world university rankings. According to the report London also ranks first in the world in software, multimedia development and design, and shares first position in technology readiness.

The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain, which should demand a form *(h)lōndinion (as opposed to *londīnion), from earlier *loundiniom.

In most cases this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the administration which governed the City of London called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Corporation of London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 12th century, where were the various bodies of English government centrally located for the most part?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Westminster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the royal treasury housed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Tower</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before being centrally located, how was the English government handled in terms of location?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, much of London passing from church to private ownership. The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable. But the tentacles of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what era did the Protestant Reformation occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Tudor period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event greatly boosted English shipping and commerce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What phenomenon did the Reformation bring about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a gradual shift to Protestantism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Typically what were the nationalities of ships that traveled to and from England via the Straight of Gibraltar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Italian or Ragusan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was England again able to ship to the Netherlands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 1565</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause.

The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the National Portrait Gallery known for housing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">depictions of figures from British history</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">London's Tate Britain and Tate Modern galleries were formerly one entity known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Tate Gallery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cultural and scientific hub was named in honor of Queen Victoria's husband?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albertopolis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What London museum was named for an historic Queen of England and her Prince husband?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original purpose for the construction of the Tate Gallery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as an annexe of the National Gallery</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>London is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and is home to major music corporations, such as EMI and Warner Music Group as well as countless bands, musicians and industry professionals.
