Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines.

They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities.

The ice of a polar glacier is always below freezing point from the surface to its base, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by the temperature at its base alone. A cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate. A warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to slide at this contact. This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed, as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below. Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where is the temperature of a glacier measured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">base alone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of glacier is above or at freezing at it's interface and is able to slide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">warm-based glacier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What temperature makes a glacier polythermal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">partly cold-based and partly warm-based</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What temperature determines a polar glacier?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">always below freezing point from the surface to its base</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What temperature characteristic determines a temperate glacier?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">melting point throughout the year, from its surface to its base</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation. The area in which a glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm) - a typically armchair-shaped geological feature (such as a depression between mountains enclosed by arêtes) - which collects and compresses through gravity the snow which falls into it. This snow collects and is compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it forming névé. Further crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns it into 'glacial ice'. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it 'overflows' through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure. On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15 m (50 ft) of snow-ice.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under what circumstances do glaciers form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a cirque?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The area in which a glacier forms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What shape is a cirque, generally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">armchair-shaped</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much ice and snow is minimally necessary to begin to slide on steep glaciers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 m (50 ft)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Glaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions. The ablation zone is the region where there is a net loss in glacier mass. The equilibrium line separates the ablation zone and the accumulation zone; it is the altitude where the amount of new snow gained by accumulation is equal to the amount of ice lost through ablation. The upper part of a glacier, where accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the accumulation zone. In general, the accumulation zone accounts for 60–70% of the glacier's surface area, more if the glacier calves icebergs. Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to exert a downward force that erodes underlying rock. After a glacier melts, it often leaves behind a bowl- or amphitheater-shaped depression that ranges in size from large basins like the Great Lakes to smaller mountain depressions known as cirques.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What characteristics determine glacial zones?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">surface snowpack and melt conditions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which glacial zone area reports a net-loss in glacial mass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ablation zone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the line seperating the ablation zone from the accumulation zone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">equilibrium line</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much glacial surface area is typically considered accumulation zone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">60–70%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.

During glacial periods of the Quaternary, Taiwan, Hawaii on Mauna Kea and Tenerife also had large alpine glaciers, while the Faroe and Crozet Islands were completely glaciated.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many countries contain glaciers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fifty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which continent contains glaciers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">every continent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which mountain ranges contain glaciers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andes, the Himalayas, the Rocky Mountains, the Caucasus, and the Alps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are glaciers in Africa located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, on Mount Kenya and in the Rwenzori Mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which sub-antarctic islands have glaciers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marion, Heard, Grande Terre (Kerguelen) and Bouvet</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation is affected by factors such as the degree of slope on the land, amount of snowfall and the winds.
