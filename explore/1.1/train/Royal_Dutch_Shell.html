It was a move largely driven by the need to compete globally with Standard Oil. The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was a Dutch company founded in 1890 to develop an oilfield in Sumatra, and initially led by August Kessler, Hugo Loudon, and Henri Deterding. The &quot;Shell&quot; Transport and Trading Company (the quotation marks were part of the legal name) was a British company, founded in 1897 by Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted, and his brother Samuel Samuel. Their father had owned an antique company in Houndsditch, London, which expanded in 1833 to import and sell sea-shells, after which the company &quot;Shell&quot; took its name.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Royal Shell Group Created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 1907</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1890</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When WAS the &quot;Shell&quot; Transport and Trading Company founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1897</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Royal Dutch Shell Group was created through the merger of which two rival companies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company of the Netherlands and the &quot;Shell&quot; Transport and Trading Company Ltd of the United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main reason for the creation of the Royal Dutch Shell Group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the need to compete globally with Standard Oil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Royal Dutch Shell Group created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1907</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1890</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to develop an oilfield in Sumatra</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Shell was vertically integrated and is active in every area of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation and trading.

On April 2010 Shell announced that the corporation is in process of trying to find a potential buyer for all of its operations in Finland and is doing similar market research concerning Swedish operations. On October 2010 Shell's gas stations and the heavy vehicle fuel supply networks in Finland and Sweden, along with a refinery located in Gothenburg, Sweden were sold to St1, a Finnish energy company, more precisely to its major shareholding parent company Keele Oy. Shell branded gas stations will be rebranded within maximum of five years from the acquisition and the number of gas stations is likely to be reduced.
