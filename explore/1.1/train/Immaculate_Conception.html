This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media. Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother, traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. In 1677, the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived, which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century. The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (when Mary was conceived free from original sin) on 8 December, exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary. The feast of the Annunciation (which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus) is celebrated on 25 March, nine months before Christmas Day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is the view of the impregnation of Mary's pregnancy the same as the one held for the birth of her first child ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">doctrine of the immaculate conception (Mary being conceived free from original sin) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the view held at the Vatican regarding how Mary was actually given life into the world ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did these contradictory views start to emerge ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">since the 4th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were contradictory views to  the belief of Mary's parentage struck down ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1677, the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the parents of Mary believed to be ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint Joachim and Saint Anne</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another misunderstanding is that, by her immaculate conception, Mary did not need a saviour. When defining the dogma in Ineffabilis Deus, Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime. He stated that Mary, rather than being cleansed after sin, was completely prevented from contracting Original Sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race. In Luke 1:47, Mary proclaims: &quot;My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.&quot; This is referred to as Mary's pre-redemption by Christ. Since the Second Council of Orange against semi-pelagianism, the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless, he would still require God's grace to remain sinless.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was explained by the man  Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti who later became leader of the Holy Roman Church ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dogma in Ineffabilis Deus, Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Mary supposedly not require that everyone else also required and why was this so ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Another misunderstanding is that, by her immaculate conception, Mary did not need a saviour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to the teaching of the Catholic religion is a savior for the world needed ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless, he would still require God's grace to remain sinless.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the child of Mary known to be famous for according to  Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the &quot;purification&quot; of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of &quot;purification&quot; in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as &quot;prokathartheisa (prepurified).&quot; Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as &quot;prepurified&quot; was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the &quot;Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]&quot; was becoming popular. After this period, the &quot;purification&quot; of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Empire held  Grecian teachers of the virginity of Mary's conception ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek theologians of Byzantium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave a reason for the purging of evil for the Blessed Virgin and her first child ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the &quot;purification&quot; of Jesus and Mary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What procedure was being performed while he gave his reasoning ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the circumcision</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was compelled to write of this instance that was also an author of one of the book of the Bible ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Luke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What became associated with the celebration of Mary's inception in the womb ? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that &quot;no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture&quot;. But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as &quot;in every respect holy&quot;, &quot;in all things unstained&quot;, &quot;super-innocent&quot;, and &quot;singularly holy&quot; are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is &quot;the earth before it was accursed&quot;. The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: &quot;As regards the mother of God,&quot; he says, &quot;I will not allow any question whatever of sin.&quot; It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin &quot;of every sort&quot; (omni ex parte).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What proof do some believe is offered as to proof of Mary being the ultimate concept of pure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">include original sin as well as actual.

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary &quot;prepurified&quot; in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was &quot;purified&quot; at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally &quot;holier than all 'Men' born of woman&quot; since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of &quot;purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.&quot; This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's &quot;pre purification&quot; as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the &quot;all pure seed&quot; of Joachim and the womb &quot;wider than heaven&quot; of St. Ann.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the majority of the concepts of Mary's birth show themselves the most ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what way did this Ruler refer to Mary  in his writings ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to call Mary &quot;prepurified&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Byzantine Ruler ho ruled from from 527 to 565 was also a well trained thinker of concepts ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emperor Justinian I,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event happened to Theotokos that was of significant religious note ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">she was &quot;purified&quot; at the Annunciation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did some view the the person whose name includes a Christian rite of passage from the Bible? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">holier than all 'Men' born of woman</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By 750, the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East, under the name of the Conception (active) of Saint Anne.

A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See.

All the same, the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios, Damascene, and their imitators. The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas. Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature, traditional objections to Palamas' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of &quot;the purification of Mary&quot; at the Annunciation. Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus' purification at His baptism and Mary's at the Annunciation, but Theophanes of Nicaea, Joseph Bryennius, and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced. In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius, St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary's title as &quot;prepurified&quot; against the Dominican, Manuel Calecas, who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sect often stands in disagreement over the virginal inception of Mary ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does this group believe of the story of a Virgin mother for Mary and those who follow its teaching ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an &quot;over-elaboration&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What in particular does the group feels is impossible to believe ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did this theological study do to set itself apart from the other groups ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">took its historical point of departure from Sophronios, Damascene, and their imitators.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the theological study of Mary called ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mariology</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Martin Luther, who initiated the Protestant Reformation, said: &quot;Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood.
