A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specializes in this field. The term &quot;botany&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word βοτάνη (botanē) meaning &quot;pasture&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;, or &quot;fodder&quot;; βοτάνη is in turn derived from βόσκειν (boskein), &quot;to feed&quot; or &quot;to graze&quot;. Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is botany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">science of plant life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the word botany mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;to feed&quot; or &quot;to graze&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is  a plant scientist called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A botanist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does botany only study plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">included the study of fungi and algae</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Botany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What science led to botany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">herbalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of plants did monasteries cultivate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plants of medical importance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did universities start growing gardens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1540s onwards</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did universities have these gardens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">facilitated the academic study of plants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was plant taxonomy developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to catalogue and describe their collections</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary metabolism, chemical products, development, diseases, evolutionary relationships, systematics, and plant taxonomy. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics, which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple foods, materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture, agriculture and forestry, plant propagation, breeding and genetic modification, in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in environmental management, and the maintenance of biodiversity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is are the main themes of present-day botany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">molecular genetics and epigenetics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can botany be applied to combating world hunger?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">providing staple foods</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can botany be applied to the construction industry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">synthesis of chemicals and raw materials</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is botany a narrow science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a broad, multidisciplinary subject</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides.

They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the University of Oxford Botanic Garden in 1621.

The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the meaning of dichotomous keys?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">choices between pairs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for keys used for identification?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diagnostic keys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were new plants arriving in Europe in the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">newly discovered countries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book is still used for nomenclature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Species Plantarum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are the plants classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">number of their male sexual organs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Increasing knowledge of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus had indicated.

The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What led scientists to believe that plants should be classified according to something other than just sexual system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Increasing knowledge of plant anatomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year to Candolle introduce the Candollean system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1819</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what did Candolle base his classification system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">morphological complexity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Darwin introduce that changed classification systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">concept of common descent</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first &quot;modern&quot; text book, Matthias Schleiden's Grundzüge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik, published in English in 1849 as Principles of Scientific Botany.

Clements is credited with the idea of climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology.

These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, and the rate of photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research.

The concept originally stated by Gottlieb Haberlandt in 1902 that all plant cells are totipotent and can be grown in vitro ultimately enabled the use of genetic engineering experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as GFP that report when a gene of interest is being expressed.

As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration.

The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, known as the gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for at least part of its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology).

This is what ecologists call the first trophic level. The modern forms of the major staple foods, such as maize, rice, wheat and other cereal grasses, pulses, bananas and plantains, as well as flax and cotton grown for their fibres, are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among wild ancestral plants with the most desirable characteristics. Botanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems.

Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibers that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record.

The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C4 carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway.

This can occur early in development to produce an autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species.

One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.

They include mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Pteridophytic vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period and diversified into several lineages during the late Silurian and early Devonian. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day. By the end of the Devonian period, several groups, including the lycopods, sphenophylls and progymnosperms, had independently evolved &quot;megaspory&quot; – their spores were of two distinct sizes, larger megaspores and smaller microspores. Their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained within the spore-producing organs (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, a condition known as endospory. Seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium surrounded by one or two sheathing layers (integuments). The young sporophyte develops within the seed, which on germination splits to release it. The earliest known seed plants date from the latest Devonian Famennian stage. Following the evolution of the seed habit, seed plants diversified, giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups, including seed ferns, as well as the modern gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms produce &quot;naked seeds&quot; not fully enclosed in an ovary; modern representatives include conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and Gnetales. Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a carpel or an ovary. Ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a sister clade to the gymnosperms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes mosses different from other land plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lack the vascular tissues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What protects the young plant in the seed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one or two sheathing layers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the plant escape the seed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">splits to release it</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for plants whose seeds do not have a protective ovary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gymnosperms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event led to the diversification of seed plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evolution of the seed habit</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life.

About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the theory of plant hormones introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what did Darwin compare the top of the plant radical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the brain of one of the lower animals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Darwin feel plants had something comparable to a brain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">movements of plant shoots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do auxins do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">promotes cell growth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can plant callus be coaxed into doing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">form roots and shoots</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell division or cytokinesis. The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are cytokinins responsible for in plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">control of cell division</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are cytokinins produced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in roots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is bud development determined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cytokinesis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the height of a plant determined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gibberelins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What acid slows or stops cell division?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abscisic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Plant anatomy is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues, whereas plant morphology is the study of their external form.

The sporophyte generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes up the bodies of vascular plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do roots contain chlorophyll?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">generally lack chlorophyll</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes a plant non-vascular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of a non-vascular plant is involved in photosynthesis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most of the plant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are sporophytes generated in liverworts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nonphotosynthetic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system. Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with Saintpaulia, or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant. In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do the roots and shoots need each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">interdependent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the roots get from the shoots?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">food</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are roots used for in beets and carrots?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to store food</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens if a plant looses roots or its shoots?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">can often regrow it</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the shoots get from the roots?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">water and minerals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or in the process of layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the stems used for in cacti?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">store water</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what are leaves used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gather sunlight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are angiosperms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of plants are gymnosperms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">woody plants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of leaves are large and flat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">foliage leaves</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Linnaeus group organisms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shared physical characteristics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Darwin change the grouping pioneered by Linnaeus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are grouping determined currently?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DNA sequences</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who maintains a standard of grouping for naming purposes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">International Botanical Congress.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kingdom Plantae belongs to Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single world-wide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase.

Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships. As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the phylogeny of a group represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relationships and heredity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are the relationships within the group determined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shared inheritance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would be an indication of a shared inheritance in two cacti?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spines produced from areoles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are areoles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pad-like structures</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Judging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently. Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why might two plants be similar but not actually be in the same group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">convergent evolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can two different plants acquire the same traits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arisen independently</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What traits show a shared ancestry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">derived characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are common ancestries represented for plant families?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tree-like diagrams</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been molecular phylogenetics, which uses molecular characters, particularly DNA sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. Clive Stace describes this as having &quot;direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.&quot; As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used now to group plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DNA sequences</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was previously used to group plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">morphological characters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is DNA grouping superior?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">genetic code itself is used</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are fungi more like plants or animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">closely related to animals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was DNA sequencing first used for grouping plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants.

Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.
