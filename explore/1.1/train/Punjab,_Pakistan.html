Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization, more than 4000 years ago. The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation. The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River. This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Achaemenids, Macedonians, Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas, and Hindu Shahi. It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time, otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire.

However, Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains. Having taken a northeasterly direction, he marched against the Aspii (mountaineers), who offered vigorous resistance, but were subdued.[citation needed] Alexander then marched through Ghazni, blockaded Magassa, and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning to the northeast, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the district now known as Pakhli. He entered Western Punjab, where the ancient city of Nysa (at the site of modern-day Mong) was situated. A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians, the people of Multan, who were very skilful in war. Alexander invested many troops, eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle, and the city of Sagala (present-day Sialkot) was razed to the ground.

The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 °C, newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 °C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat. Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993, when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 °C. In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season, referred to as barsat, which brings relief in its wake. The hardest part of the summer is then over, but cooler weather does not come until late October.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do monsoons traditionally happen in Punjab?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by May</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Punjab's weather pattern become unpredictable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">since the early 1970s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How hot do newspapers say it has gotten in Punjab?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">51 °C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the record heat spike in Multan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">54 °C</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the record heat spike in Multan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 1993</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The major and native language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi (which is written in a Shahmukhi script in Pakistan) and Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in country.
