They were appointed by local magistrates, who reported to higher authorities such as governors, who in turn were appointed by the emperor, and they oversaw the civil administration of their &quot;prefecture&quot;, or jurisdiction. Under each prefect were &quot;subprefects&quot; who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area. Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations, much like modern police detectives. Prefects could also be women.

The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal's provost, whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal. The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years' 'War, and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century. Another organisation, the Constabulary (French: Connétablie), was under the command of the Constable of France. The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337. Under King Francis I (who reigned 1515–1547), the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary. The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée, or, formally, the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two entities in Medieval France had police duties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Marshal of France and the Constable of France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were the Marshal and Constable of France formally classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Officers of the Crown of France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Marshal's force called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Marshalcy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Constable's force called, in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Constabulary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Constable's force called, in French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Connétablie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two entities in Medieval France had police duties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Marshal of France and the Constable of France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were the Marshal and Constable of France formally classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Officers of the Crown of France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Marshal's force called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Marshalcy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Constable's force called, in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Constabulary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Constable's force called, in French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Connétablie</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris, then the largest city in Europe.

A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War. There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century (Nadelmann, 1993). It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception.

The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned. By 1992, with the signing of the Schengen Treaty, which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union, there were worries that much, if not all, of this intelligence sharing was opaque, raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe (Joubert and Bevers, 1996).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Sheptycki study police cooperation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the English Channel region</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Sheptycki write about police cooperation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Channel region establish routine cross-border policing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1968</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Schengen Treaty signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Schengen Treaty do for policing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer, so it is difficult to make generalizations, but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature (Alain, 2001).

James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic.

With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime, president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What should non-lethal weapons properly be called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;less than lethal&quot; or &quot;less-lethal&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are common less-lethal weapons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">batons, tear gas, riot control agents, rubber bullets, riot shields, water cannons and electroshock weapons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is supposed to be the last resort for police?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The use of firearms or deadly force</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is South Africa's &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; policy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can police shoot fleeing convicts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brazil</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment, carried both on the person and installed in vehicles, to co-ordinate their work, share information, and get help quickly.
