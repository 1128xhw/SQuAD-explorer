It is composed of semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals changes the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the use of a transistor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a transistor made of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">semiconductor material</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why does a transistor increase a signal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the minimum amount of external connection terminals to call an item a transistor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are most transistors found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">embedded in integrated circuits</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices, and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems.

The triode, however, was a fragile device that consumed a lot of power. Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld filed a patent for a field-effect transistor (FET) in Canada in 1925, which was intended to be a solid-state replacement for the triode. Lilienfeld also filed identical patents in the United States in 1926 and 1928. However, Lilienfeld did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of high-quality semiconductor materials was still decades away, Lilienfeld's solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built. In 1934, German inventor Oskar Heil patented a similar device.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the thermionic triode invented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1907</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the purpose of the thermionic triode?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who filed a patent for the field-effect transistor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Lilienfeld file his patent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Lilienfeld file his patent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1925</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From November 17, 1947 to December 23, 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in the United States performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input. Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors. The term transistor was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term transresistance. According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch, authors of a biography of John Bardeen, Shockley had proposed that Bell Labs' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor. Having unearthed Lilienfeld’s patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a &quot;grid&quot; was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor. In acknowledgement of this accomplishment, Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what time did Bardeen and Brattain experiment on increasing signal output?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 17, 1947 to December 23, 1947</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were gold contacts attached to to increase signal output?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">germanium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Solid State Physics Group Leader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Shockley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who came up with the term transistor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John R.

Using this knowledge, he began researching the phenomenon of &quot;interference&quot; in 1947. By June 1948, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, Mataré produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947.

In an n–p–n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter–base junction is forward biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from the junction) base–collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled. Collector current is approximately β (common-emitter current gain) times the base current.

A quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices, for example, at the 65 nm technology node.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What determines the conductivity in a FET?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What controls the current between the drain and source?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the voltage applied between the gate and source</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what rate is the drain-source current increased when the gate-source current is increased?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a roughly quadratic rate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is a quadratic behavior not observed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in modern devices</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>FETs are divided into two families: junction FET (JFET) and insulated gate FET (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a metal–oxide–semiconductor FET (MOSFET), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a p–n diode with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, both devices operate in the depletion mode, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many groups are FETs split into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is a JFET different from an IGFET?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the JFET gate forms a p–n diode with the channel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the names of the groups of FETs</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">junction FET (JFET) and insulated gate FET (IGFET)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mode do both JFET and IGFET operate in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">depletion mode</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the common term for an IFGET?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a metal–oxide–semiconductor FET (MOSFET)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>FETs are further divided into depletion-mode and enhancement-mode types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage. For enhancement mode, the channel is off at zero bias, and a gate potential can &quot;enhance&quot; the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can &quot;deplete&quot; the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices; most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are FET's separated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">depletion-mode and enhancement-mode types</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what point is a channel off in enhancement-mode?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at zero bias</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what point is a channel on in depletion-mode?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at zero bias</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What channel corresponds with high current?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">n-channel devices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What channel corresponds with low current?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">p-channel devices</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) was the most commonly used transistor in the 1960s and 70s.
