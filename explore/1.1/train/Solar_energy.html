The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C.

In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the inventor who built a solar engine in 1897?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Shuman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Sun Power Company formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1908</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Shuman patented his solar engine system in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1912</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Frank Shuman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did solar engine build his solar engine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1897</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the solar engine used to power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">steam engine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Sun Power Company established?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1908</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Frank Shuman patent his solar engine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1912</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Shuman built the world’s first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt, between 1912 and 1913.

A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90–150 °C (194–302 °F). Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of 315 °C (599 °F) and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Horace de Saussure built the first box cooker in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1767</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Reflector cookers can reach temperatures in Celsius of up to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">315</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are solar cookers used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cooking, drying and pasteurization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the 3 main categories of solar cookers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">box cookers, panel cookers and reflector cookers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the box cooker?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Horace de Saussure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the typical temperature range for a box cooker?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90–150 °C (194–302 °F)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do reflector cookers require to function?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">direct light</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the &quot;right to dry&quot; clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 °C (40 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (113–140 °F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems. As of 2003, over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres (380,000 sq ft) had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m2 (9,300 sq ft) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 (14,000 sq ft) collector in Coimbatore, India, used for drying marigolds.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Solar Total Energy Project had a field of how many parabolic dishes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">114</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are transpired collectors more or less cost-effective than glazed collection systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some examples of solar concentrating technologies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first commercial solar concentrating system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the oldest uses of solar energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some items used to dry clothes without the use of electricity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Unglazed transpired collectors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable.

In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954.

While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vinters, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Little Ice Age, what did English and French farmers use to increase collection of solar energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fruit walls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Vinters have adopted solar technology to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">power grape presses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do agriculture and horticulture seek to make the most use of the solar energy captured?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to optimize the productivity of plants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some techniques used to improve crop production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did French and English farmers do during the Little Ice Age to gain more solar energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">employed fruit walls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the purpose of the fruit walls built by French and English farmers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Greenhouses convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate.

These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 –  the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a possible alternative to making carbon-based fuels from reduction of carbon dioxide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hydrogen production from protons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process converts solar energy into storable and transportable fuels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Solar chemical processes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What solar process can be used to produce different fuels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">artificial photosynthesis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s.

Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 °C (2,200 °F).

This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter.
