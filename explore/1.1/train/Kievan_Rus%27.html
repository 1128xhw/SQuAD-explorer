Vladimir the Great (980–1015) introduced Christianity with his own baptism and, by decree, that of all the inhabitants of Kiev and beyond. Kievan Rus' reached its greatest extent under Yaroslav I (1019–1054); his sons assembled and issued its first written legal code, the Rus' Justice, shortly after his death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Kievan Rus became a territory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">882</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who achieve the first major expansion of Kievan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kiev.

Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the &quot;Normanist&quot; view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What controversy currently surrounds the Rus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">whether the Rus’ were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the &quot;Rus&quot; accourding to the &quot;Normanist&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scandinavians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Russians beleive the Rus were?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Slavs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ahmad ibn Fadlan, an Arab traveler during the 10th century, provided one of the earliest written descriptions of the Rus': &quot;They are as tall as a date palm, blond and ruddy, so that they do not need to wear a tunic nor a cloak; rather the men among them wear garments that only cover half of his body and leaves one of his hands free.&quot; Liutprand of Cremona, who was twice an envoy to the Byzantine court (949 and 968), identifies the &quot;Russi&quot; with the Norse (&quot;the Russi, whom we call Norsemen by another name&quot;) but explains the name as a Greek term referring to their physical traits (&quot;A certain people made up of a part of the Norse, whom the Greeks call [...] the Russi on account of their physical features, we designate as Norsemen because of the location of their origin.&quot;).

The Rus' turned back before attacking the city itself, due either to a storm dispersing their boats, the return of the Emperor, or in a later account, due to a miracle after a ceremonial appeal by the Patriarch and the Emperor to the Virgin.

In 883, he conquered the Drevlians, imposing a fur tribute on them. By 885 he had subjugated the Poliane, Severiane, Vyatichi, and Radimichs, forbidding them to pay further tribute to the Khazars.

Trade from the Baltic also moved south on a network of rivers and short portages along the Dnieper known as the &quot;route from the Varangians to the Greeks,&quot; continuing to the Black Sea and on to Constantinople. Kiev was a central outpost along the Dnieper route and a hub with the east-west overland trade route between the Khazars and the Germanic lands of Central Europe. These commercial connections enriched Rus' merchants and princes, funding military forces and the construction of churches, palaces, fortifications, and further towns.

In 894, the Magyars and Pechenegs were drawn into the wars between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire. The Byzantines arranged for the Magyars to attack Bulgarian territory from the north, and Bulgaria in turn persuaded the Pechenegs to attack the Magyars from their rear. Boxed in, the Magyars were forced to migrate further west across the Carpathian Mountains into the Hungarian plain, depriving the Khazars of an important ally and a buffer from the Rus'. The migration of the Magyars allowed Rus' access to the Black Sea, and they soon launched excursions into Khazar territory along the sea coast, up the Don river, and into the lower Volga region. The Rus' were raiding and plundering into the Caspian Sea region from 864, with the first large-scale expedition in 913, when they extensively raided Baku, Gilan, Mazandaran and penetrated into the Caucasus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What led to Khazar having to put more strain on its military?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">expansion of the Rus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the war on Dniester and Dnieper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oleg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year were the Magyars and Pechenges drug into the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">894</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Rus raid Baku, Gilan,Mazandaran, and Caucasus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">913</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the 10th century progressed, the Khazars were no longer able to command tribute from the Volga Bulgars, and their relationship with the Byzantines deteriorated, as Byzantium increasingly allied with the Pechenegs against them.

Rus' relations with the Pechenegs were complex, as the groups alternately formed alliances with and against one another. The Pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the Rus' for agricultural goods and other products. The lucrative Rus' trade with the Byzantine Empire had to pass through Pecheneg-controlled territory, so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential. Nevertheless, while the Primary Chronicle reports the Pechenegs entering Rus' territory in 915 and then making peace, they were waging war with one another again in 920.

The Slavs had no written language, so the brothers devised the Glagolitic alphabet, later developed into Cyrillic, and standardized the language of the Slavs, later known as Old Church Slavonic.

The wealth and income of the Rus' depended heavily upon trade with Byzantium. Constantine Porphyrogenitus described the annual course of the princes of Kiev, collecting tribute from client tribes, assembling the product into a flotilla of hundreds of boats, conducting them down the Dnieper to the Black Sea, and sailing to the estuary of the Dniester, the Danube delta, and on to Constantinople. On their return trip they would carry silk fabrics, spices, wine, and fruit. The importance of this trade relationship led to military action when disputes arose. The Primary Chronicle reports that the Rus' attacked Constantinople again in 907, probably to secure trade access. The Chronicle glorifies the military prowess and shrewdness of Oleg, an account imbued with legendary detail. Byzantine sources do not mention the attack, but a pair of treaties in 907 and 911 set forth a trade agreement with the Rus', the terms suggesting pressure on the Byzantines, who granted the Rus' quarters and supplies for their merchants and tax-free trading privileges in Constantinople.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the relations between the Rus and Byzantines start to become more complicated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">after Oleg took control over Kiev</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the primary concerns the Rus and Byzantines had with oleg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">commercial, cultural, and military concerns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Rus attack the Constantinole once again?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">907</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Chronicle provides a mythic tale of Oleg's death.

A navy of 10,000 vessels, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the Bithynian coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus’ burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with Greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus’, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire. Liutprand of Cremona wrote that &quot;the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.&quot; Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus’ fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack). The outcome indicates increased military might by Byzantium since 911, suggesting a shift in the balance of power.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Igot led a Rus attack on Constantinople?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the attack by the Rus go so well on the coast at the start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the emperor of Byzatine do to some of the old retired ships to help fight the Rus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">outfitted with Greek fire throwers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How large was the fleet that attacked the Bithynian coast along with the Pecheneg allies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10,000 vessels</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Igor returned to Kiev keen for revenge.

The Emperor sent gifts and offered tribute in lieu of war, and the Rus' accepted. Envoys were sent between the Rus’, the Byzantines, and the Bulgarians in 945, and a peace treaty was completed. The agreement again focused on trade, but this time with terms less favorable to the Rus’, including stringent regulations on the conduct of Rus’ merchants in Cherson and Constantinople and specific punishments for violations of the law.

In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What territory was Vladimar Prince of before his father died?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Novgorod</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 976, where did Vladimir have to flee to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scandinavia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Christianization of Kievan begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Vladimir marry that was the sister of the Byzantine emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Princess Anna</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Vladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the Dnieper River. Adherence to the Eastern Church had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a liturgy written in Cyrillic and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the Slavic peoples. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the Eastern Slavs and introduced them to rudimentary Greek philosophy, science, and historiography without the necessity of learning Greek (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek). In contrast, educated people in medieval Western and Central Europe learned Latin. Enjoying independence from the Roman authority and free from tenets of Latin learning, the East Slavs developed their own literature and fine arts, quite distinct from those of other Eastern Orthodox countries.[citation needed] (See Old East Slavic language and Architecture of Kievan Rus for details ). Following the Great Schism of 1054, the Rus' church maintained communion with both Rome and Constantinople for some time, but along with most of the Eastern churches it eventually split to follow the Eastern Orthodox. That being said, unlike other parts of the Greek world, Kievan Rus' did not have a strong hostility to the Western world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was considered too be Kiev's most important route for trade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dnieper River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language did the church write  the liturgy in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cyrillic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did this literature help with that was written in Cyrillic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">facilitated the conversion to Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Yaroslav, known as &quot;the Wise&quot;, struggled for power with his brothers.

Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway.

In 1169 Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (Великий Князь/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to Vladimir, this way claiming the primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the Mongol invasion, the metropolitan moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Slavs from Kievan would eventually settle in the North East of the region, What would this region later become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grand Duchy of Moscow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the oldest city in the north east?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rostov</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the mongol invasion begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In 1299</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To the southwest, the principality of Halych had developed trade relations with its Polish, Hungarian and Lithuanian neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, Prince Roman Mstislavich united the two previously separate principalities. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of Grand Duke of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, Prince Daniil (r. 1238–1264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a &quot;Rex Rusiae&quot; (&quot;King of Russia&quot;) from the Roman papacy, apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople granted the King of Poland a metropolitan for his Russian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. Cyprian, a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate &quot;Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and all Rus'&quot; for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who united the two previously separated principalities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Roman Mstislavich</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which neighbors did Halych develop trade relations with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polish, Hungarian and Lithuanian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Mstislavich defeat the Kiev?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1202</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became metropolitan in 1370?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cyprian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Due to the expansion of trade and its geographical proximity, Kiev became the most important trade centre and chief among the communes; therefore the leader of Kiev gained political &quot;control&quot; over the surrounding areas.

Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of Western European feudalism. Nevertheless, urban merchants, artisans and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the veche (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of slaves. More important was a class of tribute-paying peasants, who owed labour duty to the princes.

The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers.
