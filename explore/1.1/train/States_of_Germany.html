Though international relations including international treaties are primarily the responsibility of the federal level, the constituent states have certain limited powers in this area: in matters that affect them directly, the states defend their interests at the federal level through the Bundesrat (literally Federal Council, the upper house of the German Federal Parliament) and in areas where they have legislative authority they have limited powers to conclude international treaties &quot;with the consent of the federal government&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an entrenched constitutional principle in Germany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Germany, foreign affairs is under the exclusive purvey of what? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the federation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of what states retain authority over?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">culture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The states defend their interests at the federal level through what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Bundesrat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose consent do the states need to make international treaties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the federal government</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The use of the term Länder (Lands) dates back to the Weimar Constitution of 1919.

The Holy Roman Empire comprised many petty states numbering more than 300 around 1796. The number of territories was greatly reduced during the Napoleonic Wars (1796–1814). After the Congress of Vienna (1815), 39 states formed the German Confederation. The Confederation was dissolved after the Austro-Prussian War and replaced by a North German Federation under Prussian hegemony; this war left Prussia dominant in Germany, and German nationalism would compel the remaining independent states to ally with Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, and then to accede to the crowning of King Wilhelm of Prussia as German Emperor. The new German Empire included 25 states (three of them, Hanseatic cities) and the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The empire was dominated by Prussia, which controlled 65% of the territory and 62% of the population. After the territorial losses of the Treaty of Versailles, the remaining states continued as republics of a new German federation. These states were gradually de facto abolished and reduced to provinces under the Nazi regime via the Gleichschaltung process, as the states administratively were largely superseded by the Nazi Gau system.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Holy Roman Empire comprised of how many petty states? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 300</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The number of territories was greatly reduced during what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Napoleonic Wars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A North German Federation under Prussian hegemony replaced what confederation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the German Confederation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the population did Prussia control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">62%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the land did Prussia control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">65%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, internal borders were redrawn by the Allied military governments. No single state comprised more than 30% of either population or territory; this was intended to prevent any one state from being as dominant within Germany as Prussia had been in the past. Initially, only seven of the pre-War states remained: Baden (in part), Bavaria (reduced in size), Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse (enlarged), Saxony, and Thuringia. The states with hyphenated names, such as Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saxony-Anhalt, owed their existence to the occupation powers and were created out of mergers of former Prussian provinces and smaller states. Former German territory that lie east of the Oder-Neisse Line fell under either Polish or Soviet administration but attempts were made at least symbolically not to abandon sovereignty well into the 1960s. However, no attempts were made to establish new states in these territories as they lay outside the jurisdiction of West Germany at that time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who redrew Germany's internal borders after World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Allied military governments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">No single state comprised of how much of the population after World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After WWII how many states initially remained in Germany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Former German territory that lie east of the Oder-Neisse Line went under which countries administration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polish or Soviet administration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many made to establish new states in the territories  lying east of the Oder-Neisse Line?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no attempts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Upon its founding in 1949, West Germany had eleven states.

Hugo Preuss, the father of the Weimar Constitution, drafted a plan to divide the German Reich into 14 roughly equal-sized states. His proposal was turned down due to opposition of the states and concerns of the government. Article 18 of the constitution enabled a new delimitation of the German territory but set high hurdles: Three fifth of the votes handed in, and at least the majority of the population are necessary to decide on the alteration of territory. In fact, until 1933 there were only four changes in the configuration of the German states: The 7 Thuringian states were merged in 1920, whereby Coburg opted for Bavaria, Pyrmont joined Prussia in 1922, and Waldeck did so in 1929. Any later plans to break up the dominating Prussia into smaller states failed because political circumstances were not favorable to state reforms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the debate on delimitation begin in Germany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the father of the Weimar Constitution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugo Preuss</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many states was the German Reich to divided into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Until 1933 how many configurations in the German states occurred? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Pyrmont join Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1922</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the Nazi Party seized power in January 1933, the Länder increasingly lost importance.

Moreover, in territories or parts of territories whose affiliation with a Land had changed after 8 May 1945 without a referendum, people were allowed to petition for a revision of the current status within a year after the promulgation of the Basic Law (paragraph 2). If at least one tenth of those entitled to vote in Bundestag elections were in favour of a revision, the federal government had to include the proposal into its legislation. Then a referendum was required in each territory or part of a territory whose affiliation was to be changed (paragraph 3). The proposal should not take effect if within any of the affected territories a majority rejected the change. In this case, the bill had to be introduced again and after passing had to be confirmed by referendum in the Federal Republic as a whole (paragraph 4).
