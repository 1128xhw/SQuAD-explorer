The Jìn court fled from the north to the south, causing large numbers of northern Han Chinese to move into Fujian region.

This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. It is at this time when a need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem. Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou's to be a village dialect. Over the centuries, dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Xiamen dialect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amoy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main dialect spoken in Xiamen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xiamen dialect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what dynasty did the Xiamen dialect develope?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late Ming dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city took over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in SE China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xiamen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did peasants from Zhangzhou travel north to Xiamen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in search of job opportunities</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hokkien has one of the most diverse phoneme inventories among Chinese varieties, with more consonants than Standard Mandarin or Cantonese.

After the Opium War in 1842, Xiamen (Amoy) became one of the major treaty ports to be opened for trade with the outside world. From mid-19th century onwards, Xiamen slowly developed to become the political and economical center of the Hokkien-speaking region in China. This caused Amoy dialect to gradually replace the position of dialect variants from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. From mid-19th century until the end of World War II, western diplomats usually learned Amoy Hokkien as the preferred dialect if they were to communicate with the Hokkien-speaking populace in China or South-East Asia. In the 1940s and 1950s, Taiwan also held Amoy Hokkien as its standard and tended to incline itself towards Amoy dialect.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Hokkein originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quanzhou</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Opium war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1842</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Xiamen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amoy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What port became one of the major treaty ports after the Opium War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Xiamen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What dialect did western diplomats learn to communicate with the Hokkien speaking people in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amoy Hokkien</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1990s, marked by the liberalization of language development and mother tongue movement in Taiwan, Taiwanese Hokkien had undergone a fast pace in its development.

In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools. The mother tongue movement in Taiwan even influenced Xiamen (Amoy) to the point that in 2010, Xiamen also began to implement the teaching of Hokkien dialect in its schools. In 2007, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan also completed the standardization of Chinese characters used for writing Hokkien and developed Tai-lo as the standard Hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide. A number of universities in Taiwan also offer Hokkien degree courses for training Hokkien-fluent talents to work for the Hokkien media industry and education.

However, the written script was and remains adapted to the literary form, which is based on classical Chinese, not the vernacular and spoken form. Furthermore, the character inventory used for Mandarin (standard written Chinese) does not correspond to Hokkien words, and there are a large number of informal characters (替字, thè-jī or thòe-jī; 'substitute characters') which are unique to Hokkien (as is the case with Cantonese).

Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters are commonly borrowed or substituted to represent a particular morpheme. Examples include &quot;beautiful&quot; (美 bí is the literary form), whose vernacular morpheme suí is represented by characters like 媠 (an obsolete character), 婎 (a vernacular reading of this character) and even 水 (transliteration of the sound suí), or &quot;tall&quot; (高 ko is the literary form), whose morpheme kôan is 懸. Common grammatical particles are not exempt; the negation particle m̄ (not) is variously represented by 毋, 呣 or 唔, among others. In other cases, characters are invented to represent a particular morpheme (a common example is the character 𪜶 in, which represents the personal pronoun &quot;they&quot;). In addition, some characters have multiple and unrelated pronunciations, adapted to represent Hokkien words. For example, the Hokkien word bah (&quot;meat&quot;) has been reduced to the character 肉, which has etymologically unrelated colloquial and literary readings (he̍k and jio̍k, respectively). Another case is the word 'to eat,' chia̍h, which is often transcribed in Taiwanese newspapers and media as 呷 (a Mandarin transliteration, xiā, to approximate the Hokkien term), even though its recommended character in dictionaries is 食.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most Hokkein morphemes have what type of characters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">standard designated</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In some cases, charcters are invented to represent what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a particular morpheme</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hokkien morphemes are not always what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">etymological or phono-semantic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are often borrowed to represent a particular morpheme?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hokkien, especially Taiwanese, is sometimes written in the Latin script using one of several alphabets.
