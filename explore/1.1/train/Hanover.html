The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg move his residence to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hanover</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who elevated the status of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Holy Roman Emperor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who confirmed the elevation of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1708?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Imperial Diet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which other nation would the electors of Hanover become monarchs of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first elector from Hanover to sit on the British throne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George I Louis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As an important railroad and road junction and production center, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign.

Its original name Honovere may mean &quot;high (river)bank&quot;, though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Hanover originally founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">east bank of the River Leine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Hanover possibly originally mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;high (river)bank&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Hanover become a comparitvely large town?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city was Hanover connected to by the Leine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hanseatic League city of Bremen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one example of traffic that passed through Hanover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mule trains</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 30,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was the only German army to fight against France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who imposed the Convention of Artlenburg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Napoleon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many French soldiers occupied Hanover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did many soldiers from Hanover emigrate to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Great Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the soldiers who emigrated form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King's German Legion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who elevated Hanover to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1815?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Congress of Vienna</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Berggarten is an important European botanical garden.[citation needed] Some points of interest are the Tropical House, the Cactus House, the Canary House and the Orchid House, which hosts one of the world's biggest collection of orchids, and free-flying birds and butterflies.
