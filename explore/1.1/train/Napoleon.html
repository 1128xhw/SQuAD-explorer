As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems, from Japan to Quebec.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Napoleon spent ten years as emperor of what people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Napoleon's empire collapse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1815</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are Napoleon's campaigns still studied today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military schools</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Napoleon bring civilly to his territories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">liberal reforms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Napoleon's legal achievement, still reaching a quarter of the world's legal systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Napoleonic Code</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Napoleon Bonaparte born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 August 1769</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Napoleon Bonaparte die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 May 1821</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Napoleon Bonaparte's nationality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what historical event did Napoleon rise to prominence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Napoleon Bonaparte's empire finally collapse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1815</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Napoleon Bonaparte die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 May 1821</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what historical event did Napoleon rise to prominence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Napoleon was born in Corsica to a relatively modest family of noble Tuscan ancestry. Napoleon supported the French Revolution from the outset in 1789 while serving in the French army, and he tried to spread its ideals to Corsica but was banished from the island in 1793. Two years later, he saved the French government from collapse by firing on the Parisian mobs with cannons. The Directory rewarded Napoleon by giving him command of the Army of Italy at age 26, when he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring a series of decisive victories that made him famous all across Europe. He followed the defeat of the Allies in Europe by commanding a military expedition to Egypt in 1798, invading and occupying the Ottoman province after defeating the Mamelukes and launching modern Egyptology through the discoveries made by his army.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what ancestry was Napoleon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tuscan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Napoleon save the French government in 1795?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by firing on the Parisian mobs with cannons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Napoleon when he was given command of the Army of Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">26</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Napoleon lead his troops in 1798?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Egypt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Against whom was Napoleon's first military campaign waged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Austrians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Napoleon born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Corsica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Napoleon banished from Corsica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1793</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Napoleon receive command of the Army of Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">26</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Napoleon fight his first military campaign against?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Austrians and their Italian allies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Napoleon command his military expedition to Egypt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1798</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After returning from Egypt, Napoleon engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. Another victory over the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo in 1800 secured his political power. With the Concordat of 1801, Napoleon restored the religious privileges of the Catholic Church while keeping the lands seized by the Revolution. The state continued to nominate the bishops and to control church finances. He extended his political control over France until the Senate declared him Emperor of the French in 1804, launching the French Empire. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign and a historic triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the elimination of the Holy Roman Empire. In October 1805, however, a Franco-Spanish fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar, allowing Britain to impose a naval blockade of the French coasts. In retaliation, Napoleon established the Continental System in 1806 to cut off continental trade with Britain. The Fourth Coalition took up arms against him the same year because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon knocked out Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, then turned his attention towards the Russians and annihilated them in June 1807 at Friedland, which forced the Russians to accept the Treaties of Tilsit.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Napoleon engineer a coup?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 1799</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What victory in 1800 secured Napoleon's political power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Marengo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What document restored the religious privileges of the Catholic Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Concordat of 1801</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Napoleon named Emperor of the French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1804</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Napoleon eliminate in October 1805?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Holy Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Napoleon's political power was secured by his victory at which 1800 battle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Marengo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the Concordat of 1801, Napoleon restored the religious privileges of what entity? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Catholic Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the French Senate declare Napoleon Emperor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1804</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Napoleon's victory at which battle led to the end of the Holy Roman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Austerlitz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The results of which battle allowed the British to blockade French coasts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Trafalgar</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hoping to extend the Continental System, Napoleon invaded Iberia and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808.

Fighting also erupted in Central Europe, as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809. Napoleon defeated them at the Battle of Wagram, dissolving the Fifth Coalition formed against France. By 1811, Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe, which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the Roman Empire. He maintained his strategic status through a series of alliances and family appointments. He created a new aristocracy in France while allowing the return of nobles who had been forced into exile by the Revolution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country did Napoleon invade to extend the Continental System?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iberia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the Peninsular War last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what victory did Napoleon dissolve the Fifth Coalition against France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Wagram</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people did Napoleon rule by 1811?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 70 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When, before Napoleon, had Europe last seen the same level of political consolidation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What region did Napoleon invade in an effort to extend the Continental System?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iberia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Napoleon declare King of Spain in 1808?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his brother Joseph</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the Peninsular War last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Napoleon's victory at which battle resulted in the destruction of the Fifth Coalition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Wagram</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By 1811, what was the population of Napoleon's Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 70 million people</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tensions over rising Polish nationalism and the economic effects of the Continental System led to renewed confrontation with Russia. To enforce his blockade, Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army, forcing the French to retreat, as well as leading to the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign in Central Europe eventually culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October. The next year, the Allies invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba. The Bourbons were restored to power and the French lost most of the territories that they had conquered since the Revolution. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of the government once again. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which ultimately defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June. The Royal Navy then thwarted his planned escape to the United States in July, so he surrendered to the British after running out of other options. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. His death in 1821 at the age of 51 was received with shock and grief throughout Europe. In 1840, a million people witnessed his remains returning to Paris, where they still reside at Les Invalides.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nation did Napoleon invade in 1812 to enforce his blockade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The 1812 invasion of Russia resulted in the collapse of which military unit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Grand Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Sixth Coalition formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1813</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to Russia, the Sixth Coalition consisted of forces from which two nations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prussia and Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Allies capture Paris and force Napoleon's abdication?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1814</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769, to Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, in his family's ancestral home Casa Buonaparte in Ajaccio, the capital of the island of Corsica.

As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Napoleon become engaged to in 1795?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Désirée Clary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In April 1795, what military organization was Napoleon assigned to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Army of the West</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the time of Napoleon's assignment, what military struggle was the Army of the West engaged in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the War in the Vendée</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which older brother of Napoleon's did Désirée Clary's sister Julie marry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joseph</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What excuse did Napoleon use to avoid being assigned to an infantry command?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poor health</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>He was moved to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety and sought unsuccessfully to be transferred to Constantinople in order to offer his services to the Sultan.

The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for Mantua. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring notable victories at the battles of Castiglione, Bassano, Arcole, and Rivoli.

In the first notable encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to Leoben, about 100 km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace. The Treaty of Leoben, followed by the more comprehensive Treaty of Campo Formio, gave France control of most of northern Italy and the Low Countries, and a secret clause promised the Republic of Venice to Austria.

Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria.

Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa. The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal.

The constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following January, with 99.94 percent officially listed as voting &quot;yes.&quot; Napoleon's brother, Lucien, had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite; the real number was 1.5 million. Political observers at the time assumed the eligible French voting public numbered about 5 million people, so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the Consulate.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French. However, the French lines never broke during their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the Austrian army, which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving behind 14,000 casualties. The following day, the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria, which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Napoleon and his troops cross the Swiss Alps and enter Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1800</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the French army defending Genoa against the Austrian siege?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">André Masséna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What was the date of the Battle of Marengo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Melas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did Napoleon field at the Battle of Marengo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although critics have blamed Napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle, they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy, choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west, near or along the coastline.

As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio.

Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life. Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72% of all eligible voters). There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote. His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life. After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 1802 treaty between Britain and France ended the Revolutionary Wars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Treaty of Amiens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Treaty of Amiens signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1802</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did French voters approve a constitution making the Consulate permanent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1802</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the French vote approved Napoleon's new constitution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 99%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What position was Napoleon granted in Article 1 of the new French constitution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">First Consul for Life</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the short peace in Europe, where did Napoleon turn his focus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French colonies abroad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Revolutionary War, which French colony had moved towards political independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saint-Domingue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Who was the de facto ruler of Saint-Domingue in 1801?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Toussaint Louverture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In February of what year did the national Convention vote to get rid of slavery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1794</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the French general who led the forces that attempted to regain control of Sainte-Domingue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leclerc</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin assassination plots, including the Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also known as the Infernal Machine) two months later.

For the official coronation, he raised the Charlemagne crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture, but never placed it on top because he was already wearing the golden wreath. Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head, the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David.

He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the invasion force Napoleon assembled before the creation of the Third Coalition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Armée d'Angleterre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in Northern France were the camps of the Armée d'Angleterre located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boulogne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country was the Armée d'Angleterre intended to strike at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the later military organization that the Armée d'Angleterre formed the foundation of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">La Grande Armée.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many men were in the Grande Armée by 1805?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">350,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Napoleon knew that the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a head-to-head battle, so he planned to lure it away from the English Channel through diversionary tactics.

In the face of this attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken their defense of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet to take control of the channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade. However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805.

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi). Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Armée performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions. The Ulm Maneuver completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off. After some minor engagements that culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement. For just 2000 French casualties, Napoleon had managed to capture a total of 60,000 Austrian soldiers through his army's rapid marching. The Ulm Campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century. For the French, this spectacular victory on land was soured by the decisive victory that the Royal Navy attained at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October. After Trafalgar, Britain had total domination of the seas for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By August 1805, Napoleon changed the primary target of his army's efforts from the English Channel to what area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Rhine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> On what date did French troops begin to cross the Rhine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25 September</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many French troops were involved in the crossing of the Rhine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Austrian commander who led the army at the fortress of Ulm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karl Mack</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many casualties did the French suffer at the Battle of Ulm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the Ulm Campaign, French forces managed to capture Vienna in November. The fall of Vienna provided the French a huge bounty as they captured 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the Danube. At this critical juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz. At the Battle of Austerlitz, in Moravia on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process. The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan — of the same stature as Cannae, the celebrated triumph by Hannibal some 2000 years before.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In November, after the Ulm Campaign, what city was captured by French forces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vienna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> How many muskets did the French capture in the fall of Vienna?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many cannons did the French capture when Vienna fell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">500</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Battle of Austerlitz fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2 December</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country was the Battle of Austerlitz fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Moravia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort.

Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, &quot;The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought.&quot; Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a &quot;personal Napoleonic one&quot;.

At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the political body composed of German states established by Napoleon in 1806?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Confederation of the Rhine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Confederation of the Rhine formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1806</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The existence of the Confederation of the Rhine brought about the end of which imperial power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Holy Roman Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Which Prussian ruler chose to go to war with France for control of Central Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frederick William III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other royal figure strongly influenced Frederick William III's decision to go to war with France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Louise</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carré system, the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which began to quickly disintegrate. In a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the &quot;peak of Napoleonic warfare,&quot; according to historian Richard Brooks, the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers, over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in a single month. Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces: &quot;Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered.&quot; Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did Napoleon use for the invasion of Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">180,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What river did the French cross to engage the Prussian army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Saale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom did Napoleon send a letter detailing his plans for the campaign with Prussia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marshal Soult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> On what date were the battles of Jena and Auerstedt fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14 October</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Prussian soldiers were captured at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">140,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806. The Continental System, which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain, was widely violated throughout his reign. In the next few months, Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807. After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides, the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive. On 14 June, however, Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland, wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle. The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: &quot;I hate the English as much as you do.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what 1806 proclamation did Napoleon begin to impose the Continental System?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Berlin Decree</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What was the system Napoleon imposed though the Berlin Decree?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Continental System</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Berlin Decree issued?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 1806</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Battle of Eylau?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1807</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what 14 June conflict did Napoleon win a decisive victory over the Russians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Friedland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the Duke who pressured Alexander to make peace with Napoleon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constantine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Which ocean territories did Napoleon demand Russia cede to France as part of the terms for peace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ionian Islands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the new kingdom Napoleon created from Prussian territories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Westphalia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the younger brother who Napoleon appointed as the ruler of Westphalia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jérôme</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What was the name of the series of agreements that ended war for a time and allowed Napoleon to return to France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Treaties of Tilsit</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organize his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade.

On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish cooperation and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon's orders. This attack was the first step in what would eventually become the Peninsular War, a six-year struggle that significantly sapped French strength. Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country. Marshal Murat led 120,000 troops into Spain and the French arrived in Madrid on 24 March, where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout the country. The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bailén in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Napoleon's invasion of Portugal begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 October 1807</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did Napoleon send to begin the invasion of Portugal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Napoleon select to lead the troops sent to invade Portugal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Junot</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The invasion of Portugal was the beginning of what six-year conflict?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Peninsular War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many troops did Marshal Murat lead into Spain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">120,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the Congress of Erfurt in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of Finland from Sweden, and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria &quot;to the best of its ability.&quot; Napoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The Grande Armée, under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the Ebro River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at Somosierra, Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops. He then unleashed his soldiers against Moore and the British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and they withdrew from Spain entirely after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At which 1808 meeting did Napoleon attempt to keep the Russians on his side for future conflicts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Congress of Erfurt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Congress of Erfurt held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1808</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Erfurt Convention insisted that Britain stop war against which nation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Erfurt Convention recognized the Russian takeover of which formerly Swedish possession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Finland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Battle of Corunna fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 1809</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Napoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future Duke of Wellington. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal guerrilla warfare that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict. The vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations. The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favor of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Napoleon left Iberia for Central Europe to deal with whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Austrians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many French troops were kept in Iberia during the Peninsular War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">300,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Peninsular War, in what country did guerrilla warfare frequently occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year did the Allies force the French out of the Iberian peninsula?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1814</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> In what year did the invasion of Russia take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1812</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After four years on the sidelines, Austria sought another war with France to avenge its recent defeats. Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. Frederick William of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians, but reneged before conflict began. A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized. Although Archduke Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him in the so-called &quot;peace party,&quot; he did not want to see the army demobilized either.

He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did the main Austrian army arrive at the Marchfield?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 May</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Who led the main Austrian army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did French forces make their first significant attempt to cross the Danube?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21 May</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many soldiers did Charles initially lead against the French at the Battle of Aspern-Essling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">110,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around how many casualties did the French experience at the Battle of Aspern-Essling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube.

Charles received the French with 150,000 of his own men. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram, which also lasted two days, Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then. Neither side made much progress on 5 July, but the 6th produced a definitive outcome. Both sides launched major assaults on their flanks. Austrian attacks against the French left wing looked dangerous initially, but they were all beaten back. Meanwhile, a steady French attack against the Austrian left wing eventually compromised the entire position for Charles. Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat. Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching well over 40,000 casualties. The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately, but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how long did Napoleon take to prepare another Danube crossing after his defeat at Aspern-Essling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six weeks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did the French begin the re-crossing of the Danube?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 June</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Approximately how many French troops met Charles at the Battle of Wagram?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">180,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Austrian troops did Charles lead at the Battle of Wagram?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">150,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the Battle of Wagram last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two days</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Kingdom of Holland, the British launched the Walcheren Campaign to open up a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the Austrians.

The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed &quot;Walcheren Fever.&quot; Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809.

Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians. Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, as a result of these territorial changes.

In 1861, Napoleon's remains were entombed in a porphyry sarcophagus in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Louis Philippe I get permission to return Napoleon's remains to France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1840</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> On what date was a state funeral held for Napoleon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 December 1840</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what location did the hearse carrying Napoleon's remains begin its procession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Arc de Triomphe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> In what building was the cupola where Napoleon's remains were first placed located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St Jérôme's Chapel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Napoleon's final tomb completed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1861</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1955, the diaries of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be remarkably well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the diaries of Napoleon's valet published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1955</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Napoleon's valet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Louis Marchand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> What was the possible cause for Napoleon's death suggested in a 1961 Nature paper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">arsenic poisoning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1961, who suggested the possibility that Napoleon died from ingestion of arsenic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sten Forshufvud</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What condition was Napoleon's body in when it was moved in 1840?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">well preserved</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>They maintained that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison.

Other codes (&quot;Les cinq codes&quot;) were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of due process.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the contemporary term for the set of civil laws created by Napoleon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Code Civil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Code Civil frequently referred to as now?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Napoleonic Code</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the person who supervised the preparation of the Code Civil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a code published under Napoleon that enacted rules related to due process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Code of Criminal Instruction</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>His opponents learned from Napoleon's innovations. The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent significant change.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who learned from Napoleon's innovations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">His opponents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Napoleon's use of artillery led to its increased importance after what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1807</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who rejects the theory that the increased use of artillery by the French was due to declining quality of infantry and numbers of cavalry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">McConachy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Napoleon use as the initial means of breaking down enemy defenses, rather than the traditional reliance on infantry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">artillery</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The official introduction of the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society. Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence. Napoleon ultimately took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles (traditional units of measurement) for retail trade—a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but were based on the kilogram and the metre; for example the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500 g instead of 489.5 g—the value of the livre du roi (the king's pound). Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner. This however laid the foundations for the definitive introduction of the metric system across Europe in the middle of the 19th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the metric system officially introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 1799</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What system, introduced in September 1799, was unpopular among much of French society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the metric system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Napoleon pass legislation that introduced traditional units of measurement for retail trade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1812</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> How many grams were in the livre metrique?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">500</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many grams were in the livre du roi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">489.5</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Napoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in France and throughout much of Europe. Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the Ancien Régime, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution, with the aim of establishing a stable, well-educated and prosperous society. He made French the only official language. He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered public support to secondary education. Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools (lycées) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France. All students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages. Unlike the system during the Ancien Régime, religious topics did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy. Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability. He gave special attention to the advanced centers, notably the École Polytechnique, that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science. Napoleon made some of the first major efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education. The system featured scholarships and strict discipline, with the result being a French educational system that outperformed its European counterparts, many of which borrowed from the French system.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What acts by Napoleon laid the groundwork for modernized Education in France and much of Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Napoleon's educational reforms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language did Napoleon make the only official one?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Napoleon offer to secondary education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">public support</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name for the state secondary schools begun by Napoleon that were intended to standardize education across France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lycées</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with modern and classical languages, what were all students in the lycées taught?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the sciences</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was &quot;an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler.&quot; Many historians have concluded that he had grandiose foreign policy ambitions.
