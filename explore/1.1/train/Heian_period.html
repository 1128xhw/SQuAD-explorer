The period is named after the capital city of Heian-kyō, or modern Kyōto. It is the period in Japanese history when Buddhism, Taoism and other Chinese influences were at their height. The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art, especially poetry and literature. Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface, the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family. Many emperors actually had mothers from the Fujiwara family. Heian (平安?) means &quot;peace&quot; in Japanese.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the last period of classical Japanese history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Heian period is named after what city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heian-kyō</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does heian mean in Japanese?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the prominent clan during the Heian period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fujiwara</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Heian period was known for what types of art?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poetry and literature</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Heian period was preceded by the Nara period and began in 794 A.D after the movement of the capital of Japan to Heian-kyō (present day Kyōto京都), by the 50th emperor, Emperor Kanmu. Kanmu first tried to move the capital to Nagaoka-kyō, but a series of disasters befell the city, prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time, to Heian. The Heian Period is considered a high point in Japanese culture that later generations have always admired. The period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class, which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of Japan.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the period before the Heian era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nara</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Heian period began in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">794 A.D</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What warrior class rose during the Heian era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">samurai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Heian-kyo is now what present-day city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kyōto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the emperor who moved Japan's capital to Heian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kanmu</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Nominally, sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact power was wielded by the Fujiwara nobility. However, to protect their interests in the provinces, the Fujiwara and other noble families required guards, police and soldiers.

As early as 939 A.D, Taira no Masakado threatened the authority of the central government, leading an uprising in the eastern province of Hitachi, and almost simultaneously, Fujiwara no Sumitomo rebelled in the west.

Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of Dōkyō and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there. Kyōto had good river access to the sea and could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces. The early Heian period (784–967) continued Nara culture; the Heian capital was patterned on the Chinese Tang capital at Chang'an, as was Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara. Kammu endeavoured to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use. Known as the ritsuryō, this system attempted to recreate the Tang imperium in Japan, despite the &quot;tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries&quot;. Despite the decline of the Taika-Taihō reforms, imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period. Indeed, Kammu's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles, and he became recognized as one of Japan's most forceful emperors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Heian was Japan's capital for how many years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Nara was the former capital for how many years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion was gaining popularity in Nara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddhist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What time period was the early Heian era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">784–967</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Kanmu modeled his government after what Chinese capital?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tang</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although Kammu had abandoned universal conscription in 792, he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the Emishi, possible descendants of the displaced Jōmon, living in northern and eastern Japan. After making temporary gains in 794, in 797 Kammu appointed a new commander, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, under the title Sei-i Taishōgun (Barbarian-subduing generalissimo). By 801 the shogun had defeated the Emishi and had extended the imperial domains to the eastern end of Honshū. Imperial control over the provinces was tenuous at best, however. In the ninth and tenth centuries, much authority was lost to the great families, who disregarded the Chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in Kyoto. Stability came to Japan, but, even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity, power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family, the Fujiwara which also helped Japan develop more.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the possible descendants of Jōmon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emishi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the new commander Kanmu appointed in the year 797?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sakanoue no Tamuramaro</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Tamuramaro's military title?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sei-i Taishōgun</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Emishi were defeated in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">801</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The imperial capital extended to the eastern edge of which Japanese island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Honshū</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following Kammu's death in 806 and a succession struggle among his sons, two new offices were established in an effort to adjust the Taika-Taihō administrative structure. Through the new Emperor's Private Office, the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before. The new Metropolitan Police Board replaced the largely ceremonial imperial guard units. While these two offices strengthened the emperor's position temporarily, soon they and other Chinese-style structures were bypassed in the developing state. In 838 the end of the imperial-sanctioned missions to Tang China, which had begun in 630, marked the effective end of Chinese influence. Tang China was in a state of decline, and Chinese Buddhists were severely persecuted, undermining Japanese respect for Chinese institutions. Japan began to turn inward.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Emperor Kanmu die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">806</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What office replaced the imperial guards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Metropolitan Police Board</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new office allowed government to issue administrative orders faster?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emperor's Private Office</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tang China's influence over Japan ended in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">838</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As the Soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century, the Fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family, and one of their members was the first head of the Emperor's Private Office.

Toward the end of the ninth century, several emperors tried, but failed, to check the Fujiwara.

By the early Heian period, the shōen had obtained legal status, and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity, waiver of taxes, and immunity from government inspection of the shōen they held. Those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to shōen holders in return for a share of the harvest.

There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Two types of phonetic Japanese script: katakana, a simplified script that was developed by using parts of Chinese characters, was abbreviated to hiragana, a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely Japanese. Hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan's famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in Kagerō Nikki by &quot;the mother of Fujiwara Michitsuna&quot;, The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon and The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu. Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored yamato-e, Japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid- and late Heian periods, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What script was developed with parts of Chinese characters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">katakana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the cursive script that gave expression to spoken words?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hiragana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the author of The Pillow Book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sei Shōnagon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the author of The Tale of Genji?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Murasaki Shikibu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the brightly colored paintings depicting court life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">yamato-e</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As culture flourished, so did decentralization.

(In fact, the form of the old clan system had remained largely intact within the great old centralized government.) New institutions were now needed in the face of social, economic, and political changes. The Taihō Code lapsed, its institutions relegated to ceremonial functions. Family administrations now became public institutions. As the most powerful family, the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne. Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family. Land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy, not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of Japan as a single nation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What became the aristocracy's primary occupation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Land management</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What grew during the second phase of shoen development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;house governments,&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What governmental reorganization lapsed during the period of shoen development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taihō Code</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Succession to the throne was determined by what clan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fujiwara</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Under the early courts, when military conscription had been centrally controlled, military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy.

At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi, which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi, which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks.

Yoritomo then turned his attention to the elimination of the powerful Fujiwara family, which sheltered his rebellious brother Yoshitsune. Three years later, he was appointed shogun in Kyoto. One year before his death in 1199, Yoritomo expelled the teenage emperor Go-Toba from the throne.

Tendai originated in China and is based on the Lotus Sutra, one of the most important sutras of Mahayana Buddhism; Saichō was key to its transmission to Japan. Shingon is the Japanese transmission of the Chinese Chen Yen school. Shingon, brought to Japan by the monk Kūkai, emphasizes Esoteric Buddhism. Both Kūkai and Saichō aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy, leading to the notion of 'aristocratic Buddhism'. An important element of Tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to &quot;every creature&quot;. Saichō also sought independent ordination for Tendai monks. A close relationship developed between the Tendai monastery complex on Mount Hiei and the imperial court in its new capital at the foot of the mountain. As a result, Tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation. Kammu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly Tendai sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded Emperor Kammu, and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon, through its use of &quot;rich symbols, rituals and mandalas&quot; held a wide-ranging appeal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion spread during the Heian period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddhism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the two Japanese sects of Buddhism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tendai and Shingon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who brought Shingon Buddhism to Japan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kūkai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Tendai Buddhism suggested that enlightenment was accessible to who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">every creature</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Poetry, in particular, was a staple of court life. Nobles and ladies-in-waiting were expected to be well versed in the art of writing poetry as a mark of their status. Every occasion could call for the writing of a verse, from the birth of a child to the coronation of an emperor, or even a pretty scene of nature. A well-written poem or haiku could easily make or break one's reputation, and often was a key part of social interaction.Almost as important was the choice of calligraphy, or handwriting, used. The Japanese of this period believed handwriting could reflect the condition of a person's soul: therefore, poor or hasty writing could be considered a sign of poor breeding. Whether the script was Chinese or Japanese, good writing and artistic skill was paramount to social reputation when it came to poetry. Sei Shonagon mentions in her Pillow Book that when a certain courtesan tried to ask her advice about how to write a poem to the empress Sadako, she had to politely rebuke him because his writing was so poor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artform became a mark of status in the courts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Heian period, what did the Japanese think could reflect one's soul?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">handwriting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was said to show low status or &quot;poor breeding&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poor or hasty writing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The lyrics of the modern Japanese national anthem, Kimi ga Yo, were written in the Heian period, as was The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, one of the first novels ever written.

The Heian period produced a flowering of poetry including works of Ariwara no Narihira, Ono no Komachi, Izumi Shikibu, Murasaki Shikibu, Saigyō and Fujiwara no Teika.

The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and were a fundamental base for their power. The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the Ryōmin (良民 &quot;Good People&quot;) numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the samurai were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000 the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realised system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange. The lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time. For instance, messengers were rewarded with useful objects, e.g., an old silk kimono, rather than paid a fee.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What crop was a primary source of income during the Heian period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the beneficiaries of Heian culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ryōmin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Currency gradually disappeared around what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What crop became the primary unit of exchange?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rice</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces, which left robbers free to prey on travelers.
