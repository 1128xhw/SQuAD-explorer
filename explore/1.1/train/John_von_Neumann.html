His father, Neumann Miksa (Max Neumann) was a banker, who held a doctorate in law. He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s. Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of Szerencs), Zemplén County, northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (Margaret Kann); her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels.

This was one of the best schools in Budapest, part of a brilliant education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leó Szilárd (b. 1898), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School. When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that von Neumann was the only genius.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Von Neumann enter in 1911?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lutheran Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what room did children get education in Hungary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gymnasium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What collective name was given to the generation of scholars produced by the Hungarian school system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Martians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Wigner win Nobel Prize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1963</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although Max insisted von Neumann attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an aptitude. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, sketched out on his father's stationery, are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition.

So it was decided that the best career path was to become a chemical engineer. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926.

At the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics. But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused a setback in naive set theory at the beginning of 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russell's paradox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who resolved the problem of adequate axiomatization of set theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 2 techniques did Von Neumann use to exclude sets in his doctoral thesis in 1925?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The axiom of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel, in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession, hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself.

Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., x and y) results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state ɸ of a certain electron verifies the proposition &quot;the spin of the electron in the x direction is positive.&quot; By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction y will be completely indeterminate for ɸ. Hence, ɸ can verify neither the proposition &quot;the spin in the direction of y is positive&quot; nor the proposition &quot;the spin in the direction of y is negative.&quot; Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions &quot;the spin in the direction of y is positive or the spin in the direction of y is negative&quot; must be true for ɸ.

Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story.

Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist Léon Walras. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's General Equilibrium Theory and Walras' Law, which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product.

His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR, and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the CIA interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany, and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA. The Russians believed that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons, and they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world, without necessarily using them. He was afraid of a &quot;missile gap&quot; and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was MAD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mutual assured destruction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the goal of MAD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Russians opinions of future weaponry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russians believed that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the concern of a missile gap?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">keeping up with the Soviets</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Von Neumann entered government service (Manhattan Project) primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the US would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism.

His algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the &quot;software whitening&quot; stage of some hardware random number generators. Because using lists of &quot;truly&quot; random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers, using the middle-square method. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, and also noted that when it went awry it did so obviously, unlike methods which could be subtly incorrect. &quot;Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the computations for hydrogen bomb worked out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">von Neumann's digital computers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Monte Carlo method?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Due to slow use of random numbers what was developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pseudorandom numbers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While consulting for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project, von Neumann wrote an incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC.

Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space. This architecture is to this day the basis of modern computer design, unlike the earliest computers that were &quot;programmed&quot; using a separate memory device such as a paper tape or plugboard. Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture as a result of von Neumann's paper, the architecture's description was based on the work of J.

The next computer that von Neumann designed was the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were designed and built at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby. John von Neumann recommended that the IBM 701, nicknamed the defense computer include a magnetic drum.

However, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was stochastic computing introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1953</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long before stochastic computing could be implemented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">advances in computing of the 1960s.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did von NEumann develop first self reproducing computer program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for the first self reproducing computer program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">computer virus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Von Neumann's team performed the world's first numerical weather forecasts on the ENIAC computer; von Neumann published the paper Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation in 1950.
