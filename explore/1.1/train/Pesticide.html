They are a class of biocide. The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects. This use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product, although it is in fact a broader term, as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes. The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the difference between a pesticide and a plant protection product?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of a pesticide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pesticides are substances meant for attracting, seducing, and then destroying any pest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are pesticides most commonly used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can pesticides protect plants from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What item commonly used in hospitals, schools and offices is a pesticide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sanitizer</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests.

Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate.:239–240 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.:136–137 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system.:300 Triazines interfere with photosynthesis.:335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Organochlorine hydrocarbons effect what balance of the nerve fiber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sodium/potassium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was the use of organochlorine hydrocarbons ended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of herbicide selectively kills broad leef weeds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phenoxy compounds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What essential plan funtion is interrupted by triazines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">photosynthesis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Organophospates and carbamates cause which symptoms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">weakness or paralysis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method.

With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the xylem) and outward. Increased efficiency may be a result. Systemic insecticides, which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers[citation needed], may kill bees and other needed pollinators[citation needed].</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one way you could group pesticides?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">application method</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main way that peticides perform their function?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by poisoning pests</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which direction do systemic pesticide generally travel through a plant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">movement is usually upward</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which parts of a plant do systemic pesticides generally attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pollen and nectar in the flowers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful. For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like West Nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria. They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas. Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush. They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Pesticides can be used to stop the spread of what dieseases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">West Nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of pesticides would you find in ponds and lakes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Herbicides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which agency regulates safety of pesticides in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which agency regulates safety of pesticides in Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pest Management Regulatory Agency</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>DDT, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochlorine that has been used to fight malaria since the 1950s.

The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by &quot;triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the earliest records of humans using pesticides?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">before 2000 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was used as a insecticide in the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nicotine sulfate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade did herbicides become common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who can be credited with finding out DDT is useful as an insecticide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul Müller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the source used to exact nicotine sulfate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tobacco leaves</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910; however, decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread.
