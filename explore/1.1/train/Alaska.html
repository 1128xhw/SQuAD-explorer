The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east while Russia has a maritime border with the state to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, the southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. To the south and southwest is the Pacific Ocean. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Alaska's total population according to the 2015 Census?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">738,432</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of Alaska's residents reside in the Anchorage area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Approximately half</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which industries are most prevalent in Alaska's economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fishing, natural gas, and oil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does Alaska compare in size to other US states?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">largest state in the United States by area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Alaska rank in population comparative to other US states?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3rd least populous</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States and has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the Aleutian Islands extend into the eastern hemisphere.

It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's Mount Fuji. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland.
