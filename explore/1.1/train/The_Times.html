Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt because of the complaints of a Jamaican hurricane. Being unemployed, Walter decided to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later, it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because people always omitted the word Universal, Ellias changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to The Times. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name. Walter Sr had spent sixteen months in Newgate Prison for libel printed in The Times, but his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy makers and financiers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Times was founded by what publisher who also was the editor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Walter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Times was known as what name before it became The Times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Daily Universal Register</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the very first publication of The Times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1785</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The first publisher and editor of The Times when to prison for what crime when printed in his newspaper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">libel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before the newspaper changed its name to The Times, how many editions were printed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">940</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Times used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics, science, literature, and the arts to build its reputation.

Peter Fraser and Edward Sterling were two noted journalists, and gained for The Times the pompous/satirical nickname 'The Thunderer' (from &quot;We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform.&quot;).

This allowed print room staff at The Times and The Sunday Times to be reduced by half. However, direct input of text by journalists (&quot;single stroke&quot; input) was still not achieved, and this was to remain an interim measure until the Wapping dispute of 1986, when The Times moved from New Printing House Square in Gray's Inn Road (near Fleet Street) to new offices in Wapping.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When The Times was bought in 1982, who resigned as editor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Rees-Mogg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years as an editor was editor who resigned from The Times in 1982?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1982, what is the name of the editor who replaced the previous editor of The Times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harold Evans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What printing process for The Times was replaced by computers in 1982?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hot-metal Linotype printing process</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1982, the allowed print room staff at The Times and The Sunday Times was reduced by how much?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">half</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Robert Fisk, seven times British International Journalist of the Year, resigned as foreign correspondent in 1988 over what he saw as &quot;political censorship&quot; of his article on the shooting-down of Iran Air Flight 655 in July 1988.

The font was supervised by Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent, an artist from the advertising department of The Times. Morison used an older font named Plantin as the basis for his design, but made revisions for legibility and economy of space. Times New Roman made its debut in the issue of 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. The Times stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972.

It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections, followed by support for both the Conservatives and the Liberal Party for the next five elections, expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974.
