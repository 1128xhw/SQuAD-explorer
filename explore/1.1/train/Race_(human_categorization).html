As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade, which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world, created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African slaves. Drawing on Classical sources and upon their own internal interactions — for example, the hostility between the English and Irish powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences between people — Europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical appearance, and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained. A set of folk beliefs took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to inherited intellectual, behavioral, and moral qualities. Similar ideas can be found in other cultures, for example in China, where a concept often translated as &quot;race&quot; was associated with supposed common descent from the Yellow Emperor, and used to stress the unity of ethnic groups in China. Brutal conflicts between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did many of the ideas associated with the term &quot;race&quot; arise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">time of the scientific revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What created relations between Europeans and people with different cultures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">colonization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who speculated about the observable difference among different groups of humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europeans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Justifying the subordination of what group was one of the incentives to categorize human groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African slaves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What groups has there always been brutal conflict between?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ethnic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first post-Classical published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be François Bernier's Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent (&quot;New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it&quot;), published in 1684. In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively. Homo sapiens europaeus was described as active, acute, and adventurous, whereas Homo sapiens afer was said to be crafty, lazy, and careless.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the author of the first published book classifying humans into distinct races?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">François Bernier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did differences among human groups become a focus of science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What race was typically ascribed the most desirable features?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">White</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was Homo sapiens europaeus described as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">active, acute, and adventurous</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What attributes were bestowed on homo spaiens afer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">crafty, lazy, and careless</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The 1775 treatise &quot;The Natural Varieties of Mankind&quot;, by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach proposed five major divisions: the Caucasoid race, Mongoloid race, Ethiopian race (later termed Negroid, and not to be confused with the narrower Ethiopid race), American Indian race, and Malayan race, but he did not propose any hierarchy among the races.

It was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups. Subsequent influential classifications by Georges Buffon, Petrus Camper and Christoph Meiners all classified &quot;Negros&quot; as inferior to Europeans.

A clade is a taxonomic group of organisms consisting of a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor. Every creature produced by sexual reproduction has two immediate lineages, one maternal and one paternal. Whereas Carl Linnaeus established a taxonomy of living organisms based on anatomical similarities and differences, cladistics seeks to establish a taxonomy—the phylogenetic tree—based on genetic similarities and differences and tracing the process of acquisition of multiple characteristics by single organisms. Some researchers have tried to clarify the idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the clade. Often mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome sequences are used to study ancient human migration paths. These single-locus sources of DNA do not recombine and are inherited from a single parent. Individuals from the various continental groups tend to be more similar to one another than to people from other continents, and tracing either mitochondrial DNA or non-recombinant Y-chromosome DNA explains how people in one place may be largely derived from people in some remote location.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is cladistics a method of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classification</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a clade a taxonomic group of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">organisms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many common ancestors does a clade have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">single</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for a phylogenetic tree?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">taxonomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which chromosome sequences are used to study ancient human migration paths?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Y</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Often taxonomists prefer to use phylogenetic analysis to determine whether a population can be considered a subspecies.

This would make a subspecies, evolutionarily speaking, a clade – a group with a common evolutionary ancestor population. The smooth gradation of human genetic variation in general tends to rule out any idea that human population groups can be considered monophyletic (cleanly divided), as there appears to always have been considerable gene flow between human populations. Rachel Caspari (2003) have argued that clades are by definition monophyletic groups (a taxon that includes all descendants of a given ancestor) and since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic, none of those groups can be clades.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What analysis method are taxonomists fond of using in considering a population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phylogenetic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are allopatric populations separated? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">geographically</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a group with a common evolutionary ancestor population called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a clade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a tongue twister of a word that merely means &quot;cleanly divided&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monophyletic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who argued in 2003 that all clades are by definition monophyletic groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rachel Caspari</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For the anthropologists Lieberman and Jackson (1995), however, there are more profound methodological and conceptual problems with using cladistics to support concepts of race.

It is often stated that the fixation index for humans is about 0.15. This translates to an estimated 85% of the variation measured in the overall human population is found within individuals of the same population, and about 15% of the variation occurs between populations. These estimates imply that any two individuals from different populations are almost as likely to be more similar to each other than either is to a member of their own group.

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two researchers gave a long critique regarding the application of FST to human populations in 2003?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Long and Kittles think of the implication that human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">misleading</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Non-African groups of human population may only drive from what type of sample of the African population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">non-representative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of bottleneck did the migration out of Africa represent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">genetic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much human genetic diversity exists in a single African population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In his 2003 paper, &quot;Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy&quot;, A.

Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups. Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains poorly understood. However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: &quot;Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age.

In light of the historically recent acceleration of human migration (and correspondingly, human gene flow) on a global scale, further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups. One such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the United States, and &quot;detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group.

This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian). The entire world population is much more complex and studying an increasing number of groups would require an increasing number of markers for the same answer. The authors conclude that &quot;caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes.&quot; Witherspoon, et al. concluded that, &quot;The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them.

Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as &quot;continental races&quot;, this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified &quot;diversity partitioning&quot; and &quot;clustering analysis&quot; as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols. Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Cluster structure of genetic data is dependent on what initial thing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hypotheses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If one samples a continental group, what do the clusters become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">continental</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is not a natural taxonomy of the human species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">racial classification</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are objective social constructions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">racial groupings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are diversity partition and clustering analysis are examples of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">methodologies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word &quot;ethnicity&quot; to refer to self-identifying groups based on beliefs concerning shared culture, ancestry and history.

Nevertheless, it amounts to at least three million people, and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the French policy agenda. France has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced, industrialized countries. Unlike the United States, Britain, or even the Netherlands, France maintains a &quot;color-blind&quot; model of public policy. This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups. Instead, it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities. It has, however, developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s. Until recently, French policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech—going much further than their American counterparts—and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs, housing, and in provision of goods and services.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">France has become a more ethnically diverse country since the end of which war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second World War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the French population today is non-European?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">approximately five percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the number of non-white citizens in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">roughly 28–37%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What issue has the existence of three million non-European people in France forced onto French policy agendas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ethnic diversity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of model of public policy does France maintain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">color-blind</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the early history of the United States, Amerindians, African–Americans, and European Americans have been classified as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories, such as mulatto and octoroon. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During Reconstruction, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with &quot;one drop&quot; of known &quot;Black blood&quot; to be Black, regardless of appearance.3 By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states.4 Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of &quot;Indian blood&quot; (called blood quantum). To be White one had to have perceived &quot;pure&quot; White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry. This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black. The one-drop rule is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Groups of people have been classified as belonging to difference races since what part of the U.S.'s history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did efforts to track mixing between different groups lead to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a proliferation of categories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the criteria for membership in mixed race groups diverge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the late 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did increasing numbers of Americans consider anyone with even a drop of &quot;Black blood&quot; to be Black?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">During Reconstruction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a particularly African-American experience because it's specific to only the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The one-drop rule</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The term &quot;Hispanic&quot; as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers from the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America to the United States.

According to one academic journal entry, where 78 percent of the articles in the 1931 Journal of Physical Anthropology employed these or nearly synonymous terms reflecting a bio-race paradigm, only 36 percent did so in 1965, and just 28 percent did in 1996.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concept's use has declined significantly in the U.S. during the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biological race</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The majority of what group in the U.S. has rejected the concept of biological races?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">physical anthropologists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What textbooks introducing anthropology have rejected race as a valid concept since 1932?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">college</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many books out of 33, from 1975 to 1984, rejected race?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thirteen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of articles in 1996 employed a bio-race paradigm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28 percent</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to the 2000 edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook, forensic anthropologists are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races. Forensic physical anthropologist and professor George W. Gill has said that the idea that race is only skin deep &quot;is simply not true, as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm&quot; and &quot;Many morphological features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones. This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose, cheekbones, etc. (For example, more prominent noses humidify air better.)&quot; While he can see good arguments for both sides, the complete denial of the opposing evidence &quot;seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all&quot;. He also states that many biological anthropologists see races as real yet &quot;not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology even presents that perspective as a possibility. In a case as flagrant as this, we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant, politically motivated censorship&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of anthropologists overwhelmingly support the idea of human races?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">forensic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does George W.

In clinical settings, race has sometimes been considered in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. Doctors have noted that some medical conditions are more prevalent in certain racial or ethnic groups than in others, without being sure of the cause of those differences. Recent interest in race-based medicine, or race-targeted pharmacogenomics, has been fueled by the proliferation of human genetic data which followed the decoding of the human genome in the first decade of the twenty-first century. There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research.

Many people have a highly varied ancestry. For example, in the United States, colonial and early federal history were periods of numerous interracial relationships, both outside and inside slavery. This has resulted in a majority of people who identify as African American having some European ancestors. Similarly, many people who identify as white have some African ancestors. In a survey in a northeastern U.S. university of college students who identified as &quot;white&quot;, about 30% were estimated to have up to 10% African ancestry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a problem with racial assignments? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">admixture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people have a varied ancestry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Many</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were periods of numerous interracial relationships in the U.S.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">colonial and early federal history</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who do many people who identify as white have for ancestors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of African ancestry were 30% of college students identifying as white estimated to have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
