It is the second most populous city in North Carolina, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the &quot;City of Oaks&quot; for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population to be 439,896 as of July 1, 2014. It is also one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What state is Raleigh the capital of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Carolina</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the biggest city in NC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charlotte</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is it named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Walter Raleigh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What county is Raleigh in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the population of the city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">439,896</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Raleigh is home to North Carolina State University and is part of the Research Triangle area, together with Durham (home of Duke University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).

In the United States Civil War the city was spared from any significant battle, only falling in the closing days of the war, though it did not escape the economic hardships that plagued the rest of the American South during the Reconstruction Era. The twentieth century saw the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, and with the jobs it created the region and city saw a large influx of population, making it one of the fastest growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of city is Raleigh?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">planned</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was it incorporated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1792</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened in the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Research Triangle Park</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What war was near the city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Civil War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of community is it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fastest growing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Raleigh is home to numerous cultural, educational, and historic sites.

As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War, but due to the economic problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the governor during the Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zebulon Baird Vance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the governor order constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">breastworks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Raleigh captured by in the Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Union cavalry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the cavalry in the capture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugh Judson Kilpatrick</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the city not grow during the Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a state economy based on agriculture,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News &amp; Observer.

George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. They were unsuccessful. In 1900, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive. It was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. No African American was elected to Congress until 1992.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the last time two black congressmen were elected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1898</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What district were the congressmen in 1898 from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2nd</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened in 1900?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the state legislature passed a new constitution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did blacks lose the right to vote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1908</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did black regain the right to vote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-1960s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs.
