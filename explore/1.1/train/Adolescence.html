It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Puberty causes what to happen in boys?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a deeper voice and larger adam's apple</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What releases testosterone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The testes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What releases estrogen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ovaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes gynecomastia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">obesity.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes puberty? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a surge in hormone production</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A surge in hormone production triggers a number of physical changes during what stage of life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Puberty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which gland secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pituitary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the body releases testosterone in males?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">testes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the body relesases estrogen in females?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ovaries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">An imbalance in sex hormones, tissue responsiveness, or obesity can cause what in boys?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gynecomastia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pubertal development also affects circulatory and respiratory systems as an adolescents' heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity.

Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often tend to have a good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are sexual actvity and risky behaviors more likely in boys that mature early or later?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Increased aggresiveness and early sexual maturation in adolescent boys are due to a surge of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hormones</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are early or late maturing boys generally taller and stronger than their friends?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Early</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one reason a late maturing boy may be less confident when comparing himself to others?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poor body image</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Wisdom, or the capacity for insight and judgment that is developed through experience, increases between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five, then levels off.

Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. Cognitive advances encompass both increases in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions. Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is adolescence defined biologically?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is adolescence defined cognitively?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">changes in the ability to think abstractly and multi-dimensionally</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is adolescence defined socially?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a period of preparation for adult roles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Changes to sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass are examples of which type of change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biological</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Increases in knowledge and the ability to think abstractly are examples of which kind of change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cognitive</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jean Macfarlane founded the University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, formerly called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute was instrumental in initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the University of California, Berkeley's Institude of Human Development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jean Macfarlane</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the University of California, Berkeley's Instutute of Human Development founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1927</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Univerity of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development formerly called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Institute of Child Welfare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Oakland Growth Study initiated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1931</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did data for the Oakland Growth Study stop being collected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1981</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The major landmark of puberty for males is the first ejaculation, which occurs, on average, at age 13.

Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics).

The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation. Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What activity often results in a boy's first ejaculation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">masturbation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are primary sex characteristics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those directly related to the sex organs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the first stage of puberty involve for males?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">growth of the testes and scrotum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After growth of the testes and scrotum, while male body part experiences growth next?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">penis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which male body parts enlarge and develop at the same time as the penis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral gland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites in the first place and this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what stage do parents see their children as equals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early adolescence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what stage of development is there increased parent-child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">puberty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During puberty and adolescence, do most children share the same or different attitudes and values as their parents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">same</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first areas of the brain to be pruned are those involving primary functions, such as motor and sensory areas. The areas of the brain involved in more complex processes lose matter later in development. These include the lateral and prefrontal cortices, among other regions. Some of the most developmentally significant changes in the brain occur in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision making and cognitive control, as well as other higher cognitive functions. During adolescence, myelination and synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex increases, improving the efficiency of information processing, and neural connections between the prefrontal cortex and other regions of the brain are strengthened. This leads to better evaluation of risks and rewards, as well as improved control over impulses. Specifically, developments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are important for controlling impulses and planning ahead, while development in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is important for decision making. Changes in the orbitofrontal cortex are important for evaluating rewards and risks.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the brain is involved in decision making and cognitive control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prefrontal cortex</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which area of the brain is important for controlling impulses and planning ahead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the brain is important for evaluating rewards and risks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">orbitofrontal cortex</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which are the first areas to be pruned during puberty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those involving primary functions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Motor and sensory skills are examples of what kind of brain function?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">primary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are both more likely to continued to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one area in which peer groups can have positive influences on an individual?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">academic motivation and performance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some of the negative experiences that peer pressure can influence during adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age does succeptability to peer pressure peak?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some social skills that peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">empathy, sharing, and leadership</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are at least two major approaches to understanding cognitive change during adolescence.

While adolescents may engage in casual sexual encounters (often referred to as hookups), most sexual experience during this period of development takes place within romantic relationships. Adolescents can use technologies and social media to seek out romantic relationships as they feel it is a safe place to try out dating and identity exploration. From these social media encounters, a further relationship may begin. Kissing, hand holding, and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment. Among young adolescents, &quot;heavy&quot; sexual activity, marked by genital stimulation, is often associated with violence, depression, and poor relationship quality. This effect does not hold true for sexual activity in late adolescence that takes place within a romantic relationship. Some research suggest that there are genetic causes of early sexual activity that are also risk factors for delinquency, suggesting that there is a group who are at risk for both early sexual activity and emotional distress. For old adolescents, though, sexual activity in the context of romantic relationships was actually correlated with lower levels of deviant behavior after controlling for genetic risks, as opposed to sex outside of a relationship (hook-ups)</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Casual sexual encounters are often referred to as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hookups</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do most sexual experiences during adolescence take place within or seperate from romantic relationships?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">within</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do some adolescents feel is a safe place to seek out romantic relationships, try out dating and indentity exploration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social media</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What seperates &quot;heavy&quot; sexual activity from other forms of affection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">genital stimulation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For older adolescents, is sexual activity in a romantic relationship associated with lower or higher levels of deviant behavior?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lower</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A third gain in cognitive ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process referred to as metacognition.

It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased introspection, self-consciousness, and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that people do not have complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the imaginary audience and the personal fable.

In addition, from a population perspective, there is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing to take more risks and try new methods, counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical of the received knowledge held by older adults. Risktaking may also have reproductive advantages: adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating, and risk-taking is required to impress potential mates.

For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does the search for identity begin for most individuals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">adolescent years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some factors that make developing and maintaining an identity during the adolescent years a difficult task?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">family life, environment, and social status</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two main aspects of identity development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self-clarity and self-esteem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the three general approaches to understanding identity development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more or less difficult time developing their identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more difficult</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Research since reveals self-examination beginning early in adolescence, but identity achievement rarely occurring before age 18.

Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of &quot;identity achievement&quot; but also stressed that the identity challenge &quot;is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time&quot;. Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. &quot;Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.&quot; Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers &quot;finding their selves&quot;; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. &quot;Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.&quot; This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which theorist argued that not everyone fully achieves identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Erik Erikson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do adolescents initially define themselves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">crowd membership</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is Moratorium defined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">process of exploration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which researcher developed the current method for testing an individual's process along the stages of identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Marcia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">James Marcia divides questions into how many categories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. &quot;Barometric self-esteem&quot; fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun &amp; Sartorius, 1995).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which term is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Self-esteem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is there evidence to support a drop in self-esteem during adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of self-esteem fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barometric self-esteem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of self-esteem remains stable throughout adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">baseline self-esteem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most important function of friendship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">having someone who can provide social and moral support</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In terms of sexual identity, adolescence is when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin to recognize and make sense of their feelings. Many adolescents may choose to come out during this period of their life once an identity has been formed; many others may go through a period of questioning or denial, which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences. A study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one's sexual orientation occurred, on average, around age 10, but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17, respectively. Coming to terms with and creating a positive LGBT identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else. While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment, the risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out in the midst of a heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence. Because of this, statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age does awareness of one's sexual orientation occur on average?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age does coming out to one's peers occur on average?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age does coming out to adults occur on average?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times higher is the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents than their heterosexual peers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are factors causing a hightened suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bullying and rejection from peers or family members</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite changing family roles during adolescence, the home environment and parents are still important for the behaviors and choices of adolescents.

With the divorce rate up to about 50%, divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent. In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can have a positive effect on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time. Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory, which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training. A parental divorce during childhood or adolescence continues to have a negative effect when a person is in his or her twenties and early thirties. These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the current divorce rate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 50%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does divorce usually result in more or less contact with the noncustodial parent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">less</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new theory states that traumatic events during adolescence have lifelong effects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">epistemological trauma theory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does a parental divorce during childhood or adulthood have a positive or negative effect on a person during early adulthood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">negative</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some examples of social and religious transition ceremonies that can be found in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification. Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are a few examples of social and religious transition ceremonies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some physical ways that some cultures mark the transition into adulthood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tattoos and scarification</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do cultural transitions into adulthood vary, or are they the same?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Romantic relationships tend to increase in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do romantic relationships tend to increase or decrease throughout adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increase</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many percent of adolescents have had a romantic relationship lasting one month or longer by age 15?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">53%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what average age did American males report their first sexual intercourse took place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17.0</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what average age did American females report their first sexual intercourse took place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17.3</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does the typical duration of relationships increase or decrease throughout the teenage years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increases</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures.

Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a youth culture. For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture. However, &quot;culture&quot; should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group.

While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose &quot;anything but intercourse&quot; for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of sexually active teenagers will contract an STI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">One in four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Girls ages 15 to 19 have higher rates of what STD than any other age group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gonorrhea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ratio of all new HIV cases occur in those under age 21?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">One-quarter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, what percentage of parents want schools to discuss contraception with their children?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eighty-one percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of the teenage population is affected by herpes and HPV?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Adolescence is a period frequently marked by increased rights and privileges for individuals.

This includes protecting children against unchecked child labor, enrollment in the military, prostitution, and pornography.

Differences between families in the distribution of financial responsibilities or provision of allowance may reflect various social background circumstances and intrafamilial processes, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values, as well as by the business sector and market economy of a given society.

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is—in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention. Lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transsexual youth face much discrimination through bullying from those unlike them and may find telling others that they are gay to be a traumatic experience. The range of sexual attitudes that a culture embraces could thus be seen to affect the beliefs, lifestyles, and societal perceptions of its adolescents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word refers to the first ejactulation of a male?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">semenarche</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word refers to the first menstrual period in females?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">menarche</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for a culture that discourages sexual activity in unmarried adolescents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Restrictive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for cultures that perceive sexual behavior among unmarried teens as acceptable or even encouraged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">permissive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are males and females expected to express their sexuality in the same ways or are there discrepancies between genders and cultures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">discrepancies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Drinking habits and the motives behind them often reflect certain aspects of an individual's personality; in fact, four dimensions of the Five-Factor Model of personality demonstrate associations with drinking motives (all but 'Openness').

Alcohol use as a negative emotion control mechanism often links with many other behavioral and emotional impairments, such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of the Five-Factor Model dimensions does not demonstrate an association with drinking motives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Openness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is alcohol use a positive or negative emotion control mechanism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">negative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which motivation for drinking alcohol results in low conscientiousness, lowered inhibition, and greater tendency towards aggression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">enjoyment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Drinking to cope with negative emotional states correlates strongly with what behavioral qualities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high neuroticism and low agreeableness</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although research has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces face-to-face communication, impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers.

Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in Internet cafés seems only to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens, who find it easier to interact socially online. The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities.

This understanding of youth was based on two then new ways of understanding human behavior: Darwin's evolutionary theory and Freud's psychodynamic theory. He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as Erik Erikson and Anna Freud started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between identity formation and role fulfillment. Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s. From the '50s until the '80s, the focus of the field was mainly on describing patterns of behavior as opposed to explaining them.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first president of the American Psychological Association?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">G.

While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which adolescent ethninticy is most often studied?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">white</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What social class of adolescents is most often studied?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">middle class</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The period of one's life that spans late adolescence and early adulthood is known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">youth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is an inner city or crime-driven neighborhood more or less likely to be detrimental to one's development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more likely</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are children from suburban communities more likely to participate in activies that benefit their identity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. &quot;The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and, ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).&quot; This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one’s identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one’s development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has the largest affect over one's social development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">relationships</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do a teen's friends have a large or small impact on their social development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do adolescents become heavily emotionally invested in friends or are they generally anti-social?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heavily emotionally invested in friends</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Peer groups are essential to social and general development. Communication with peers increases significantly during adolescence and peer relationships become more intense than in other stages  and more influential to the teen, affecting both the decisions and choices being made. High quality friendships may enhance children's development regardless of the characteristics of those friends. As children begin to bond with various people and create friendships, it later helps them when they are adolescent and sets up the framework for adolescence and peer groups. Peer groups are especially important during adolescence, a period of development characterized by a dramatic increase in time spent with peers and a decrease in adult supervision. Adolescents also associate with friends of the opposite sex much more than in childhood and tend to identify with larger groups of peers based on shared characteristics. It is also common for adolescents to use friends as coping devices in different situations. A three-factor structure of dealing with friends including avoidance, mastery, and nonchalance has shown that adolescents use friends as coping devices with social stresses.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does communication with peers increase or decrease during adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do children or adolescents tend to associae with friends of the opposite sex more?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adolescents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is adolescence defined socially?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a period of development characterized by a dramatic increase in time spent with peers and a decrease in adult supervision</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some researchers are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; they want to move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality.[why?] College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there weren't any significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did adolescents report more sexual or social events to researchers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social events</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do researchers believe the social event reporting by adolescents (rather than sexual activity) is important?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Holding hands with one's partner and telling others about a relationship are examples of what kind of adolescent event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">romantic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy. Emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers. Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions. Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation. Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents. Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors. Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the three main types of autonomy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is behavioral autonomy defined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Adolescent cultural differences are especially visible in which type of autonomy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Behavioral</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is cognitive autonomy defined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is an adolescent's mental health at its best when their feelings of autonomy match closely with their parents or when they are at odds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">match closely</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Furthermore, the amount of time adolescents spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations, as well as various socioeconomic factors.

In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.

Sibling interactions are children's first relational experiences, the ones that shape their social and self-understanding for life.

Older siblings can give guidance to younger siblings, although the impact of this can be either positive or negative depending on the activity of the older sibling.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does intimacy between same-sex siblings increase or decrease during adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When siblings act as peers, what positive effects are possible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increase one another's sociability and feelings of self-worth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what stage to mixed-sex siblings generally experience an increase in intimacy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">middle adolescence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Adolescents tend to associate with &quot;cliques&quot; on a small scale and &quot;crowds&quot; on a larger scale. During early adolescence, adolescents often associate in cliques, exclusive, single-sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close. Despite the common notion that cliques are an inherently negative influence, they may help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity. Within a clique of highly athletic male-peers, for example, the clique may create a stronger sense of fidelity and competition. Cliques also have become somewhat a &quot;collective parent,&quot; i.e. telling the adolescents what to do and not to do. Towards late adolescence, cliques often merge into mixed-sex groups as teenagers begin romantically engaging with one another. These small friend groups then break down further as socialization becomes more couple-oriented. On a larger scale, adolescents often associate with crowds, groups of individuals who share a common interest or activity. Often, crowd identities may be the basis for stereotyping young people, such as jocks or nerds. In large, multi-ethnic high schools, there are often ethnically-determined crowds. While crowds are very influential during early and middle adolescence, they lose salience during high school as students identify more individually.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do adolescents associate with &quot;cliques&quot; on a large or small scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the positive effects that cliques may have on an adolescent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are cliques defined?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exclusive, single-sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do adolescents associate with &quot;crowds&quot; on a large or small scale?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">larger</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dating violence is fairly prevalent within adolescent relationships. When surveyed, 10-45% of adolescents reported having experienced physical violence in the context of a relationship while a quarter to a third of adolescents reported having experiencing psychological aggression. This reported aggression includes hitting, throwing things, or slaps, although most of this physical aggression does not result in a medical visit. Physical aggression in relationships tends to decline from high school through college and young adulthood. In heterosexual couples, there is no significant difference between the rates of male and female aggressors, unlike in adult relationships.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of adolescents reporting having experienced physical violence in a relationship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10-45%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of adolescents reported experiencing psychological aggression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a quarter to a third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hitting, throwing objects, and slaps are examples of what type of aggression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Physical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In heterosexual adolescent couples, is there a significant difference in the rates of male and female aggressors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does physical aggression decline or increase during high-school, college, and early adulthood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decline</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The lifestyle of an adolescent in a given culture is profoundly shaped by the roles and responsibilities he or she is expected to assume. The extent to which an adolescent is expected to share family responsibilities is one large determining factor in normative adolescent behavior. For instance, adolescents in certain cultures are expected to contribute significantly to household chores and responsibilities. Household chores are frequently divided into self-care tasks and family-care tasks. However, specific household responsibilities for adolescents may vary by culture, family type, and adolescent age. Some research has shown that adolescent participation in family work and routines has a positive influence on the development of an adolescent's feelings of self-worth, care, and concern for others.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does adolescent participation in family work and routines have a positive or negative influence on feelings of self-worth, care, and concern for others?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">positive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are household chores frequently divided?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self-care tasks and family-care tasks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one large determining factor in normative adolescent behavior?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The extent to which an adolescent is expected to share family responsibilities</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Adolescence is frequently characterized by a transformation of an adolescent's understanding of the world, the rational direction towards a life course, and the active seeking of new ideas rather than the unquestioning acceptance of adult authority. An adolescent begins to develop a unique belief system through his or her interaction with social, familial, and cultural environments. While organized religion is not necessarily a part of every adolescent's life experience, youth are still held responsible for forming a set of beliefs about themselves, the world around them, and whatever higher powers they may or may not believe in. This process is often accompanied or aided by cultural traditions that intend to provide a meaningful transition to adulthood through a ceremony, ritual, confirmation, or rite of passage.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Through what means does an adolescent develop a unique belief system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">interaction with social, familial, and cultural environments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The active seeking of new ideas rather than the unquestioning acceptance of adult authority is known as what stage of development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adolescence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What things are youth responsible for forming a set of beliefs about during adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">themselves, the world around them, and whatever higher powers they may or may not believe in</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ceremonies, rituals, and confirmations are examples of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cultural traditions that intend to provide a meaningful transition to adulthood</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because exposure to media has increased over the past decade, adolescents' utilization of computers, cell phones, stereos and televisions to gain access to various mediums of popular culture has also increased.

In the last decade, the amount of time that adolescents spend on the computer has greatly increased.

In fact, studies suggest that more significantly than actual drug norms, an individual's perception of the illicit drug use by friends and peers is highly associated with his or her own habits in substance use during both middle and high school, a relationship that increases in strength over time. Whereas social influences on alcohol use and marijuana use tend to work directly in the short term, peer and friend norms on smoking cigarettes in middle school have a profound effect on one's own likelihood to smoke cigarettes well into high school. Perhaps the strong correlation between peer influence in middle school and cigarette smoking in high school may be explained by the addictive nature of cigarettes, which could lead many students to continue their smoking habits from middle school into late adolescence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the alcohol and illegal drug habits of teens tend to be shaped by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the substance use of friends and other classmates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one possible reasoning behind many students choosing to continue their smoking habits from middle school into late adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">addictive nature of cigarettes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do peer acceptance and social norms have a greater or lesser effect on behavior at the onset of adolescence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">significantly greater</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The age of consent to sexual activity varies widely between jurisdictions, ranging from 12 to 20 years, as does the age at which people are allowed to marry.
