In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nearby settlement built ships for the Royal Navy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Devonport</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Plymouth become a city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1928</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term used to describe the attacks on Plymouth during the Second World War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Plymouth Blitz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Plymstock incorporated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1967</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Plymouth and Devonport, what location was merged into a county borough in 1914?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">East Stonehouse</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city is home to 261,546 (mid-2014 est.) people, making it the 30th most populous built-up area in the United Kingdom.

In 1403 the town was burned by Breton raiders. In the late fifteenth century a 'castle quadrate' was constructed close to the area now known as The Barbican; it included four round towers, one at each corner, as featured on the city coat of arms. The castle served to protect Sutton Pool, which is where the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the establishment of Plymouth Dockyard. In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth, and a series of fortifications were then built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596, which itself went on to provide the site for the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year during the Hundred Years' War did the French assault Plymouth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1340</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who set fire to Plymouth in 1403?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Breton raiders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the fortification later known as Drake's Fort constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1596</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before Plymouth dockyard was built, where was the fleet located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sutton Pool</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Parliament pass a notable law that led to the building of fortifications in Plymouth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1512</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the 16th century locally produced wool was the major export commodity.

The civil war ended as a Parliamentary win, but monarchy was restored by King Charles II in 1660, who imprisoned many of the Parliamentary heroes on Drake's Island. Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665, after the Restoration; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town, rumoured to be a reminder to residents not to oppose the Crown.

A peripheral road system connecting the historic Barbican on the east and Union Street to the west determines the principal form of the city centre, even following pedestrianisation of the shopping centre in the late 1980s, and continues to inform the present 'Vision for Plymouth' developed by a team led by Barcelona-based architect David MacKay in 2003 which calls for revivification of the city centre with mixed-use and residential. In suburban areas, post-War prefabs had already begun to appear by 1946, and over 1,000 permanent council houses were built each year from 1951–57 according to the Modernist zoned low-density garden city model advocated by Abercrombie. By 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built, more than 13,500 of them permanent council homes and 853 built by the Admiralty. Plymouth is home to 28 parks with an average size of 45,638 square metres (491,240 sq ft). Its largest park is Central Park, with other sizeable green spaces including Victoria Park, Freedom Fields Park, Alexandra Park, Devonport Park and the Hoe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was the publication of the Plan for Plymouth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">27 April 1944</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the Plan for Plymouth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Patrick Abercrombie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What street was intended to connect Plymouth Hoe to the railroad station?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Armada Way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who headed the team that created the 'Vision for Plymouth'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David MacKay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many parks exist in Plymouth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Along with the rest of South West England, Plymouth has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb) which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. This means a wide range of exotic plants can be grown. The annual mean temperature is approximately 11 °C (52 °F). Due to the modifying effect of the sea the seasonal range is less than in most other parts of the UK. As a result of this summer highs are lower than its southerly latitude should warrant, but as a contrast the coldest month of February has mean minimum temperatures as mild as between 3 and 4 °C (37 and 39 °F). Snow is rare, not usually equating to more than a few flakes, but there have been exclusions, namely the European winter storms of 2009-10 which, in early January, covered Plymouth in at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of snow; more on higher ground. Another period of notable snow occurred from 17–19 December 2010 when up to 8 inches (20 cm) of snow fell through the period – though only 2 inches (5.1 cm) would lie at any one time due to melt. Over the 1961–1990 period, annual snowfall accumulation averaged less than 7 cm (3 in) per year.

The Devonport Leat was constructed to carry fresh drinking water to the expanding town of Devonport and its ever growing dockyard. It was fed by three Dartmoor rivers: The West Dart, Cowsic and Blackabrook. It seems to have been carrying water since 1797, but it was officially completed in 1801. It was originally designed to carry water to Devonport town, but has since been shortened and now carries water to Burrator Reservoir, which feeds most of the water supply of Plymouth.
