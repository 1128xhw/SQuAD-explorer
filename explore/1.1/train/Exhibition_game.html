In team sports, matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament. If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues, exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other. The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is 'a friendly' another term for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exhibition game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is 'a scrimmage' another term for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exhibition game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is 'a demonstration' another term for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exhibition game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is 'a preseason game' another term for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exhibition game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is 'a warmup match' another term for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exhibition game</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge, to provide professional entertainment, to promote the sport, or to raise money for charities.

Friendly football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are only used to &quot;warm up&quot; players for a new season/competitive match. There is generally nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with (such as unlimited substitutions, which allow teams to play younger, less experienced, players, and no cards). Although most friendlies are simply one-off matches arranged by the clubs themselves, in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club, some teams do compete in short tournaments, such as the Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament. Although these events may involve sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even be broadcast on television, there is little prestige attached to them.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do football clubs still play friendlies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">before the start of each season</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of football matches are non-competitive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">friendlies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some friendlies change the rules to make unlimited?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">substitutions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some examples of friendly short football tournaments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do friendly short football tournaments have little of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prestige</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>International teams also play friendlies, generally in preparation for the qualifying or final stages of major tournaments.

Caps and goals scored also count towards a player's career records.

Like the NFL, the NHL sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own NHL teams, often at a club's minor league affiliate (e.g. Carolina Hurricanes games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, home of their AHL affiliate; Los Angeles Kings games at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California, home of their ECHL affiliate; Montreal Canadiens games at Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City, which has no pro hockey but used to have an NHL team until 1995; Washington Capitals at 1st Mariner Arena in the Baltimore Hockey Classic; various Western Canada teams at Credit Union Centre in Saskatoon, a potential NHL expansion venue). Since the 2000s, some preseason games have been played in Europe against European teams, as part of the NHL Challenge and NHL Premiere series.

Major college basketball teams still travel to other countries during the summer to play in exhibition games, although a college team is allowed one foreign tour every four years, and a maximum of ten games in each tour.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a corporate sponsor of a basketball team?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marathon Oil</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a team of former college players?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Athletes in Action</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the FIBA stop allowing pros on foreign national teams?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the NCAA decide college teams could only play other college teams?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How often does the NCAA allow college teams to go overseas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one foreign tour every four years</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many preseason exhibition games does an NFL team play?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the one exception to the NFL's 4-preseason-game limit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What month are most NFL preseason games in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many players can an NFL team have in the off-season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many players can an NFL team have in the regular season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">53</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Arena Football League briefly had a two-game exhibition season in the early 2000s, a practice that ended in 2003 with a new television contract.

Intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves little ability for poll participants to make judgments, and at levels below the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), championships are decided by objective formulas and thus those teams can play non-league games without affecting their playoff hopes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What consideration is more important for college teams than exhibition games?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opinion polling</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a game called in which a team plays against itself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Intramural</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Championships are decided by formulas for college teams below what level?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Football Bowl Subdivision</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, most of the major FBS teams annually schedule early season non-conference preseason home games against lesser opponents that are lower-tier FBS, Football Championship, or Division II schools, which often result in lopsided victories in favor of the FBS teams and act as exhibition games in all but name, though they additionally provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance for the smaller school. These games also receive the same criticism as NFL exhibition games, but instead it is targeted to schools scheduling low-quality opponents and the simplicity for a team to run up the score against a weak opponent. However, these games are susceptible to backfiring, resulting in damage in poll position and public perception, especially if the higher ranked team loses, although the mere act of scheduling a weak opponent is harmful to a team's overall strength of schedule itself. Games an FBS team schedules against lower division opponents do not count toward the minimum seven wins required for bowl eligibility, and only one game against an FCS team can be counted. With the start of the College Football Playoff system for the 2014 season, major teams are now discouraged from scheduling weaker opponents for their non-conference schedule because of a much higher emphasis on strength of schedule than in the Bowl Championship Series era.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Major FBS teams can have lopsided victories against what kinds of lesser opponents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lower-tier FBS, Football Championship, or Division II schools</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do smaller schools want to play against major FBS teams?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many wins are required for an FBS team to be eligible for the bowl?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many games between FBS and FCS teams count towards the FBS's bowl eligibility?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the College Football Playoff System begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2014</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>High school football teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice, but exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances, travel and player injuries, along with enrollments not being registered until the early part of August in most school districts under the traditional September–June academic term. A more common exhibition is the high school football all-star game, which brings together top players from a region. These games are typically played by graduating seniors during the summer or at the end of the season.
