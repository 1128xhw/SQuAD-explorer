Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century. The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, joining in World War I to achieve this ambition on the side of Germany and the Central Powers. While the Empire was able to largely hold its own during the conflict, it was struggling with internal dissent, especially with the Arab Revolt in its Arabian holdings. Starting before the war, but growing increasingly common and violent during it, major atrocities were committed by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians and Pontic Greeks. The Empire's defeat and the occupation of part of its territory by the Allied Powers in the aftermath of World War I resulted in the emergence of a new state, Turkey, in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland following the Turkish War of Independence, as well as the founding of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the capital of the Ottoman empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constantinople</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Ottoman empire controlled lands contributed to the centre of transactions between East and West ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lands around the Mediterranean basin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Ottoman empire decline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">into the late nineteenth century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nation did the Ottoman empire align with in the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What led to the decline of the Ottoman empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military setbacks against European powers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The word Ottoman is a historical anglicisation of the name of Osman I, the founder of the Empire and of the ruling House of Osman (also known as the Ottoman dynasty).

One of the emirates was led by Osman I (1258–1326), from whom the name Ottoman is derived. Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the Byzantine Empire.

The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe.

In the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The ensuing civil war lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession.

The next 13 sultans from 1566 to 1703, with two exceptions, were lackadaisical or incompetent rulers, says Lee. In a highly centralized system, the failure at the center proved fatal. A direct result was the strengthening of provincial elites who increasingly ignored Constantinople. Secondly the military strength of European enemies grew stronger and stronger, while the Ottoman armies and arms scarcely improved.

The Long War against Habsburg Austria (1593–1606) created the need for greater numbers of Ottoman infantry equipped with firearms, resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy. This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps, which were never fully solved. Irregular sharpshooters (Sekban) were also recruited, and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts (1595–1610), which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With the Empire's population reaching 30 million people by 1600, the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government . In spite of these problems, the Ottoman state remained strong, and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats. The only exceptions were campaigns against the Safavid dynasty of Persia, where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost, some permanently. This 1603–1618 war eventually resulted in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha, which ceded the entire Caucasus, except westernmost Georgia, back into Iranian Safavid possession. Campaigns during this era became increasingly inconclusive, even against weaker states with much smaller forces, such as Poland or Austria.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the late 16th century war against Habsburg Austria known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Long War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what years did the Ottoman war against Habsburg Austria occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1593–1606</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were ottoman irregular sharpshooters known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sekban</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of the Ottoman empire at the beginning of the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30 million people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A war occurring from 1603 to 1618 resulted in what treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treaty of Nasuh Pasha</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During his brief majority reign, Murad IV (1612–1640) reasserted central authority and recaptured Iraq (1639) from the Safavids.

In turn, the higher educational levels of the Christians allowed them to play a large role in the economy. In 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in Istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic Greeks. Of course, it would be a mistake to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of this dynamic. The preponderance of Christian merchants owed not to any innate business sense on their part, although plenty of European observers were keen on making this point.

The body controlled swaths of the Ottoman economy, and used its position to insure that European capital continued to penetrate the empire, often to the detriment of local Ottoman interests.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What historian wrote that banks were the single greatest threat to mid-east independence? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eugene Rogan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Ottoman Empire declare bankruptcy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1875</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the administration that the empire used to control its debt called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ottoman Public Debt Administration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who served on the debt controlling administration of the Ottoman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European men with presidency alternating between France and Britain.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">European capital in the Ottoman empire resulted in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the detriment of local Ottoman interests</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Ottoman bashi-bazouks brutally suppressed the Bulgarian uprising of 1876, massacring up to 100,000 people in the process.

It restored the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and brought in multi-party politics with a two-stage electoral system (electoral law) under the Ottoman parliament. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire’s citizens to modernize the state’s institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers. Its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place. Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire. Young Turks movement members once underground (named committee, group, etc.) established (declared) their parties. Among them “Committee of Union and Progress,” and “Freedom and Accord Party” were major parties. On the other end of the spectrum were ethnic parties which included; Poale Zion, Al-Fatat, and Armenian national movement organized under Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Profiting from the civil strife, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908. The last of Ottoman censuses was performed with the 1914 census. Ottoman military reforms resulted with the Ottoman Modern Army which engaged with Italo-Turkish War (1911), Balkan Wars (1912–1913), and continuous unrest (Counter coup followed by restoration and Saviors followed by Raid on Porte) in the Empire up to World War I.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What era kicked off the end of the Ottoman empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second Constitutional Era</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the revolution that sparked the end of the Ottoman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Young Turk Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The restoration of what happened in 1876?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ottoman constitution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were two major parties established by Young Turk members?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Committee of Union and Progress,” and “Freedom and Accord Party”</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What territories were annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bosnia and Herzegovina</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The history of the Ottoman Empire during World War I began with the Ottoman engagement in the Middle Eastern theatre.

The Arab Revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, and set the partition of the Ottoman Empire under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres. This treaty, as designed in the conference of London, allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. The occupation of Constantinople and İzmir led to the establishment of a Turkish national movement, which won the Turkish War of Independence (1919–22) under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (later given the surname &quot;Atatürk&quot;). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, Mehmed VI (reigned 1918–22), left the country on 17 November 1922.

The Ottomans practiced a system in which the state (as in the Byzantine Empire) had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic Iran remained important in Ottoman administrative circles. According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders within the overarching context of orthodox Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the highest ranked person in the Ottoman Empire until the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sultan was the highest position</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On type of system were the civil administrations of the empire based on? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">local administrative units based on the region's characteristics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who had control over the clergy in the Ottoman empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main responsibility of the Ottoman state as it relates to lands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to defend and extend the land of the Muslims</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of practice guided the Ottoman state in its responsibilities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">orthodox Islamic practice</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Ottoman Empire or, as a dynastic institution, the House of Osman was unprecedented and unequaled in the Islamic world for its size and duration. In Europe, only the House of Habsburg had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns (kings/emperors) from the same family who ruled for so long, and during the same period, between the late 13th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability. As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918–1922) was a direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant of the first Ottoman sultan Osman I (r. 1299–1326), which was unparallelled in both Europe (e.g. the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world. The primary purpose of the Imperial Harem was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the Ottoman throne and secure the continuation of the direct patrilineal (male-line) descendance of the Ottoman sultans.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was another name for the Ottoman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Osman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the other longest ruling House in Europe known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Habsburg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what origin did the Ottoman empire come to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turkish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was the the sitting sultan in the House of Osman removed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eleven occasions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the reign of sultan Mehmed VI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1918–1922</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate.

The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the &quot;Sultanate of Women&quot;. New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Ottoman Caliphate claimed by Murad Ir epresented what in Islam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The highest position</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The person with this what title was believed to be the embodiment of the Ottoman government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pâdişâh or &quot;lord of kings&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the importantance of the imperial Harem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the purpose of the palace educational system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the boarding school for Christians during the Ottoman Caliphate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Enderûn</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Though the sultan was the supreme monarch, the sultan's political and executive authority was delegated.

Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors).

The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the Ottoman Army included Janissary, Sipahi, Akıncı and Mehterân. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using falconets, which were short but wide cannons, during the Siege of Constantinople. The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour, using bows and short swords on fast Turkoman and Arabian horses (progenitors of the Thoroughbred racing horse), and often applied tactics similar to those of the Mongol Empire, such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack. The decline in the army's performance became clear from the mid-17th century and after the Great Turkish War. The 18th century saw some limited success against Venice, but in the north the European-style Russian armies forced the Ottomans to concede land.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the first Osman I organized military unit form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where did tribesmen that formed a unit organized by Osman I originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the hills of western Anatolia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">There were four corps of the Ottoman Army, what were they?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Janissary, Sipahi, Akıncı and Mehterân</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Ottoman army was among the first to use what two pieces of weapons technology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">muskets and cannons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what conflict did the Ottoman Turks use falconets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Siege of Constantinople</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Ottoman Navy vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent.

The vast majority of Divan poetry was lyric in nature: either gazels (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kasîdes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnevî, a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry; the two most notable examples of this form are the Leyli and Majnun of Fuzûlî and the Hüsn ü Aşk of Şeyh Gâlib.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of Ottoman poetry is ritualized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Divan poetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of poetry inspired Ottoman Divan Poetry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persian poetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of framework was Divan poetry based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a strict metrical framework</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the romance genre of Divan poetry known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mesnevî</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What make up the largest portion of Divan poetry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gazels (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kasîdes.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did.

Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature.

The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are: Balkan-Thracian Türküs, North-Eastern (Laz) Türküs, Aegean Türküs, Central Anatolian Türküs, Eastern Anatolian Türküs, and Caucasian Türküs. Some of the distinctive styles were: Janissary Music, Roma music, Belly dance, Turkish folk music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the three most used Anatolian and central asian instruments in Ottoman Classical music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the saz, the bağlama, the kemence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Middle Eastern instruments can be heard in Ottoman classical music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ud, the tanbur, the kanun, the ney</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In late Ottoman classical music one can find Western instruments, what were they?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the violin and the piano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">There were two main style of music in the Ottoman empire, what were they?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classical music, and folk music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the most distinctive style of music in the Ottoman provinces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Janissary Music, Roma music, Belly dance, Turkish folk music</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ottoman cuisine refers to the cuisine of the capital, Istanbul, and the regional capital cities, where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that most of the population regardless of ethnicity shared.

Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy. Another example is Ali Qushji -an astronomer, mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas, and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years before his death in Istanbul.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Ottoman's start to desire foreign manuscripts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15th Century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which sultan ordered a Greek scholar to do translations of work by Ptolemy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sultan Mehmet II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did an Ottoman sultan order to translate work by Ptolemy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Georgios Amiroutzes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years did Ali Qushji spend in Istanbul?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two or three years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Ali Qushji from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">originally from Samarkand</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The main sports Ottomans were engaged in were Turkish Wrestling, hunting, Turkish archery, horseback riding, Equestrian javelin throw, arm wrestling, and swimming.
