This view is commonly contrasted with rationalism, which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses. For example, John Locke held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone. Similarly Robert Boyle, a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas.

The intellect itself develops from a material intellect (al-'aql al-hayulani), which is a potentiality &quot;that can acquire knowledge to the active intellect (al-'aql al-fa'il), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge&quot;.

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a &quot;blank tablet&quot;, in Locke's words &quot;white paper&quot;, on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for certainty of Descartes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was 'An Essay Concerning Human Understanding' published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1689</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Locke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does 'tabula rasa' mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blank tablet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Locke say 'tabula rasa' meant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">white paper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Locke's 'tabula rasa' concept say happens to the mind?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A generation later, the Irish Anglican bishop, George Berkeley (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual atheism.

(For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)

Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Hume think our beliefs are?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Hume think our beliefs can't be established solely by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reason</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Hume think is a circular argument?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the justification for inductive reasoning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Hume say we can't know by inductive reasoning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that the sun will continue to rise in the East</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Hume say we expect the sun to rise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because it has repeatedly done so in the past</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit. According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences. Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist — hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the &quot;permanent possibility of sensation&quot;. Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for all meaningful knowledge including mathematics. As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What conclusion do most of Hume's followers disagree with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Hume say can't be rationally justified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">belief in an external world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is phenomenalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is subjective idealism closely related to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Phenomenalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Stuart Mill say matter is?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;permanent possibility of sensation&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such &quot;groups of permanent possibilities of sensation&quot; might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of &quot;reality&quot; that goes beyond mere &quot;possibilities of sensation&quot;, such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the &quot;gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all&quot;. Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Mill say knowledge comes from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an inductive inference from direct experience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sensations did Mill differentiate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">actual and possible sensations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Mill left a question of sensations unanswered, how did Berkeley answer it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Mill say might not actually exist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gap-filling entities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Mill misrepresent about math?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the third man).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What phase of empiricism ended in the 1940s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phenomenalist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can't a finite set of statements be described?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in purely sensory terms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is necessary to explain a doctor's normality in sensory terms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a second doctor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Logical empiricism (also logical positivism or neopositivism) was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from mathematical logic that had been developed by Gottlob Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Bertrand Russell born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1872</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Bertrand Russell die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Frege say about math?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all mathematical truths are logical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Wittgenstein say about logic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are pseudoproblems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions.

To this, Peirce added the concept of abductive reasoning. The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today. Peirce's approach &quot;presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them. According to Peirce's doctrine of fallibilism, the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long before Peirce did Hume write?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Peirce view inductive vs deductive reasoning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">complementary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Hume view inductive vs deductive reasoning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">competitive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did fallibilism say?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the conclusions of science are always tentative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the scientific method's rationality depend on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its self-corrective character</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In his Harvard &quot;Lectures on Pragmatism&quot; (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the &quot;three cotary propositions of pragmatism&quot; (L: cos, cotis whetstone), saying that they &quot;put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism&quot;. First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or &quot;thisness&quot; – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction. Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them. This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research, most recently for instance with the work of Irvin Rock on indirect perception.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote 'Lectures on Pragmatism'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peirce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was 'Lectures on Pragmatism' published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1903</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is 'haecceity'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unique individuality or &quot;thisness&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Irvin Rock write about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indirect perception</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where has 'perception as abduction' come up repeatedly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term &quot;radical empiricism&quot; to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism – though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures.

Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience. The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation, in physical sciences as in ethics.
