It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase &quot;the empire on which the sun never sets&quot; was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The United Kingdom ruled what empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which empire was the largest in history, at its height?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did 458 million people live in the British Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1922</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the world's population did the British Empire rule in 1922?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one-fifth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many square miles did the British Empire rule in 1922?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13,000,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (and then, following union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain) the dominant colonial power in North America and India.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which centuries was the Age of Discovery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15th and 16th centuries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries pioneered European exploration of the globe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portugal and Spain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did England become Great Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1707</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries began colonizing because they envied the empires of Portugal and Spain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England, France, and the Netherlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country combined with England to form Great Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scotland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (&quot;British Peace&quot;), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the &quot;workshop of the world&quot;. The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Thirteen Colonies become independent from Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1783</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which war caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American War of Independence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which wars was France defeated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Pax Britannica mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Peace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Britain called the &quot;workshop of the world&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1851</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the start of the 20th century, Germany and the United States challenged Britain's economic lead. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire. The conflict placed enormous strain on the military, financial and manpower resources of Britain. Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I, Britain was no longer the world's pre-eminent industrial or military power. In the Second World War, Britain's colonies in South-East Asia were occupied by Imperial Japan. Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire. India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the Empire. The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire. Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty. After independence, many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations, a free association of independent states. The United Kingdom is now one of 16 Commonwealth nations, a grouping known informally as the Commonwealth realms, that share one monarch—Queen Elizabeth II.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which countries challenged Britain's economic lead by the start of the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Germany and the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country was Britain's most valuable and populous possession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Britain transfer Hong Kong to China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">overseas territories remain under British sovereignty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many overseas territories remain under British sovereignty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fourteen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the Commonwealth's monarch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Elizabeth II</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The foundations of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms.

Cabot sailed in 1497, five years after the European discovery of America, and although he successfully made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland (mistakenly believing, like Christopher Columbus, that he had reached Asia), there was no attempt to found a colony.

In the meantime the Protestant Reformation had turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies . In 1562, the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic trade system. This effort was rebuffed and later, as the Anglo-Spanish Wars intensified, Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the New World. At the same time, influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee (who was the first to use the term &quot;British Empire&quot;) were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific ocean, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and Brazil to China, and France had begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River area, later to become New France.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Protestant Reformation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John Hawkins and Francis Drake attack Spanish and Portuguese slave ships?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1562</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did John Hawkins and Francis Drake attack Spanish and Portuguese slave ships?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">off the coast of West Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave their blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elizabeth I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which author was the first to use the term &quot;British Empire&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Dee</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1578, Elizabeth I granted a patent to Humphrey Gilbert for discovery and overseas exploration.

In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Walter Raleigh, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584.

Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies. The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the English settlement of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean, and the establishment of private companies, most notably the English East India Company, to administer colonies and overseas trade. This period, until the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after the American War of Independence towards the end of the 18th century, has subsequently been referred to by some historians as the &quot;First British Empire&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was James I's name/title before taking the English throne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James VI, King of Scots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did James I negotiate the Treaty of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1604</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country did England negotiate the Treaty of London with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the English East India Company form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What period ended towards the end of the 18th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;First British Empire&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Caribbean initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits. Colonies in St Lucia (1605) and Grenada (1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts (1624), Barbados (1627) and Nevis (1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch. In 1655, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did England first establish a colony in Guiana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1604</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did England first establish a colony in St. Lucia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1605</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did England annex the island of Jamaica from the Spanish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1655</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did England colonize the Bahamas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1666</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the goal of England's colony in Guiana?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to find gold deposits</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>England's first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in Jamestown, led by Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company. Bermuda was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck there of the Virginia Company's flagship, and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company. The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown, thereby founding the Colony of Virginia. The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful. In 1620, Plymouth was founded as a haven for puritan religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous trans-Atlantic voyage: Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics (1634), Rhode Island (1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut (1639) for Congregationalists. The Province of Carolina was founded in 1663. With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for Suriname. In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was England's first permanent settlement in the Americas founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1607</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was England's first permanent settlement in the Americas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jamestown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led England's first permanent settlement in the Americas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Captain John Smith</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Somer Isles Company take over managing Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1615</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did England rename New Netherland to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New York</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Two years later, the Royal African Company was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, slavery was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780, and in the 13 Colonies from 10 percent to 40 percent over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the so-called triangular trade with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company had monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal African Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the British slave trade abolished?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1807</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many African slaves did Britain transport to the Americas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3.5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The triangular slave trade was between Africa, the Americas, and which British cities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bristol and Liverpool</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the death rate during the Middle Passage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one in seven</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1695, the Scottish Parliament granted a charter to the Company of Scotland, which established a settlement in 1698 on the isthmus of Panama.

The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union, establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Company of Scotland granted a charter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1695</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Panama colonized by Scotland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1698</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the Scottish Panama colony survive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much Scottish capital was lost in the Panama colony attempt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a quarter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Treaty of Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1707</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the British East India Company chartered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1600</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Dutch East India Company chartered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1602</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When had the British East India Company overtaken the Dutch East India Company in sales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1720</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Anglo-Dutch Wars were there in the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Dutch East India Company focused on trade in which industry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spice</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe.

The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the French equivalent of the English East India Company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Compagnie française des Indes orientales</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Battle of Plassey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1757</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the British in the Battle of Plassey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Clive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were the Carnatic Wars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Indian Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the British Indian Army mostly composed of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian sepoys</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global Seven Years' War (1756–1763) involving France, Britain and the other major European powers.

The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence.

The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Jansz in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company, but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean, claimed the continent for Britain, and named it New South Wales. In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788. Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840.

The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India.

The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente.

British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and with several African polities, including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902).

Although the issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, at the same time the empire was vital to the British economy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Britain sign the Washington Naval Treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1922</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Great Depression helped which countries' governments become more militaristic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japan and Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Britain had to choose between its Japanese alliance or the US, which did it choose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">British imperialism was being reconsidered in light of which territories' independence movements?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India and Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1919, the frustrations caused by delays to Irish home rule led members of Sinn Féin, a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats at Westminster in the 1918 British general election, to establish an Irish assembly in Dublin, at which Irish independence was declared. The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration. The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown. Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Ireland establish their own assembly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What political party established Ireland's assembly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sinn Féin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Anglo-Irish War end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1921</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What treaty was signed after the Anglo-Irish War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anglo-Irish Treaty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many counties of Ireland are in Northern Ireland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence.

This led to tension, particularly in the Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.

British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Egypt regain formal independence from Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1922</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Egypt stop being a British client state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1954</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What treaty was signed in 1936?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anglo-Egyptian Treaty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Iraq gain independence from Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1932</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Britain became more pro-Arab in the 1930s at the expense of which race?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jewish</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference.

After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be &quot;autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another&quot; within a &quot;British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;. This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression.

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill successfully lobbied President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military aid from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask Congress to commit the country to war. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement that &quot;the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live&quot; should be respected.

Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States.

Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check. The &quot;wind of change&quot; ultimately meant that the British Empire's days were numbered, and on the whole, Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable, non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to. This was in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal, which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact. Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to five million, three million of whom were in Hong Kong.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much money did the US loan to Britain after WW2?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$US 4.33 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Britain finish paying back the US loan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the US make a large loan to Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1946</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Though the US and the Soviet Union were both against colonialism, what was the US more afraid of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">communism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people outside the UK were under British rule in 1945?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">700 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the British government elected in 1945?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Clement Attlee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were India's two largest political parties in the 1940s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was India's majority religion in the 1940s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hindu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When India was split into Hindu and Muslim areas, what country did the Muslim area become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pakistan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Burma get its independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1948</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The British Mandate of Palestine, where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with a similar problem to that of India.

Britain maintained a military presence in the Middle East for another decade. In January 1968, a few weeks after the devaluation of the pound, Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence Secretary Denis Healey announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases East of Suez, which included the ones in the Middle East, and primarily from Malaysia and Singapore.

The New Hebrides achieved independence (as Vanuatu) in 1980, with Belize following suit in 1981. The passage of the British Nationality Act 1981, which reclassified the remaining Crown colonies as &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot; (renamed British Overseas Territories in 2002) meant that, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete. In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the Spanish Empire. Britain's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing Falklands War was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain's status as a world power. The same year, the Canadian government severed its last legal link with Britain by patriating the Canadian constitution from Britain. The 1982 Canada Act passed by the British parliament ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution. Similarly, the Constitution Act 1986 reformed the constitution of New Zealand to sever its constitutional link with Britain, and the Australia Act 1986 severed the constitutional link between Britain and the Australian states. In 1984, Brunei, Britain's last remaining Asian protectorate, gained its independence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Canada given full control of its constitution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1982</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Rhodesia become Zimbabwe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the remaining British territories called in 1981?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Dependent Territories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the remaining British territories called in 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Overseas Territories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which 1980s war victory helped Britain seem more like a world power again?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Falklands War</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In September 1982, Prime minister Margaret Thatcher travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong.

Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China. A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong would become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years.
