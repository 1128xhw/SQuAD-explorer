His episcopate lasted 45 years (c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373), of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman emperors.

He was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him. The clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, Patriarch of Alexandria, and refused to accept any excuses.

George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered. An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the &quot;Galileans&quot; to return to their &quot;towns and provinces&quot;.

Roman emperor Constantine the Great had convened the council in May–August 325 to address the Arian position that the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, is of a distinct substance from the Father. Three years after that council, Athanasius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of Alexandria. In addition to the conflict with the Arians (including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by Eusebius of Nicomedia), he struggled against the Emperors Constantine, Constantius II, Julian the Apostate and Valens.

Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312–328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander &quot;invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen&quot;. Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen – On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the &quot;entirely allegorical interpretation of the text&quot;. Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes Homer more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In his letter to Emperor Constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was persecution of Christianity the worst?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the East</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What famous Greek author did Athanasius  quote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Homer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Peter of Alexandria martyred?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in 311</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who could have been one of Athanasius's teachers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peter of Alexandria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What suggests that Athanasius was familiar with ancient Greek philosophers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quoting Plato</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In about 319, when Athanasius was a deacon, a presbyter named Arius came into a direct conflict with Alexander of Alexandria. It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop. Arius's theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity, and his Christological views were certainly not radical at all. He embraced a subordinationist Christology which taught that Christ was the divine Son (Logos) of God, made, not begotten, heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like Origen, and which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time. Support for Arius from powerful bishops like Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia, further illustrate how Arius's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire. Arius was subsequently excommunicated by Alexander, and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made Arius's belief about Jesus different from Alexander's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Son (Logos) of God, made, not begotten</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was this differing view common among Christians of the day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">common Christological view</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other leaders believed this?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">powerful bishops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What eventually happened to Arius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">excommunicated by Alexander</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Athanasius's episcopate began on 9 May 328 as the Alexandrian Council elected Athanasius to succeed the aged Alexander. That council also denounced various heresies and schisms, many of which continued to preoccupy his 45-year-long episcopate (c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373). Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life. This gave rise to the expression &quot;Athanasius contra mundum&quot; or &quot;Athanasius against the world&quot;. However, during his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of Egypt and Libya. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including Pachomius, which proved very valuable to him over the years. Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against Arians within the Byzantine Empire that would occupy much of his life.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Athanasius succeed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexander</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many exiles did he endure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five exiles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The churches of what countries were in his territory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Egypt and Libya</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was he united with the Arians in his beliefs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">disputes against Arians</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Early in the year 343 we find Athanasius had travelled, via Rome, from Alexandria, North Africa, to Gaul; nowadays Belgium / Holland and surrounding areas, where Hosius of Cordoba was Bishop, the great champion of orthodoxy in the West. The two, together, set out for Sardica. A full Council of the Church was convened / summoned there in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes. The travel was a mammoth task in itself. At this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the Church, the case of Athanasius was taken up once more, that is, Athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a man called Arsenius and using his body for magic, – an absurd charge.). [The Council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against Athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the Semi-Arian Synod of Antioch (341), and went into exile. It was called according to Socrates, (E. H. ii. 20) by the two Emperors, Constans and Constantius; but, according to Baronius by Pope Julius (337–352), (Ad an. 343). One hundred and seventy six attended. Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the Council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. Their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops, about a hundred were orthodox, who were the majority. The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, Philippopolis (Thracia), where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch. ]. Once more, at the Council of Sardica, was his innocence reaffirmed. Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known. Meanwhile, the Eusebian party had gone to Philippopolis, where they issued an anathema against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if the Saint attempt to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. Athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from Sardica to Naissus in Mysia, where he celebrated the Easter festival of the year 344. It was Hosius who presided over the Council of Sardica, as he did for the First Council of Nicaea, which like the 341 synod, found Athanasius innocent. &amp;. He celebrated his last Easter in exile in Aquileia in April 345, received by bishop Fortunatianus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Gaul currently located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Belgium / Holland and surrounding areas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the verdict at the Council of Sardica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his innocence reaffirmed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With whom did Athanasius travel to Sardica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hosius of Cordoba</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About what did the Council of the Church question Athanasius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">misdemeanours and even murder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was Athanasius permitted admission to the Council?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Pope Julius had died in April, 352, and was succeeded by Liberius.

In 355 a council was held at Milan, where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops, a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world. With his friends scattered, the saintly Hosius in exile, and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies, Athanasius could hardly hope to escape. On the night of 8 February, 356, while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas, a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest.

Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council. They sought to hold two councils. Constantius, summoned the bishops of the East to meet at Seleucia in Isauria, and those of the West to Rimini in Italy. A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at Sirmium, to agree a formula of faith. A &quot;Homoeon&quot; creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be &quot;like the Father&quot;. The two met in autumn of 359. At Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-Arian. The semi-Arians refused to accept anything less than the &quot;Homoiousion&quot;, (see: Homoiousian), formulary of faith. The Imperial Prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed. Acacius, the leader of the &quot;Homoean&quot; party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the &quot;Home Synod&quot;, (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians. At Rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were Arian, the rest were orthodox. The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the Nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the Sirmian. Each party sent a deputation to the Emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses. For the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (Sulpitius Severius says), Constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the Sirmian creed. It was after this Council that Jerome said: &quot; ...the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did bishops of the West meet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rimini in Italy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What belief was accepted by Constantius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the belief that was approved at this council?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Son to be &quot;like the Father&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the orthodox leaders believe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Nicene</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Arians agree upon at Sirmium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a formula of faith</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty.

In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the &quot;Chronicon Athanasianum&quot; (XXXV) as a &quot;philosopher&quot;, seems to have behaved with brutal insolence.

Nonetheless, during his later exile, with no access to a copy of the Scriptures, Athanasius could quote from memory every verse in the Old Testament with a supposed reference to the Trinity without missing any.[citation needed] The combination of Scriptural study and of Greek learning was characteristic of the famous Alexandrian School.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did Athanasius speak Greek?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">knew Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did he understand Hebrew?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not knowing Hebrew</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did he know all of the Old Testament?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">limited to the Septuagint</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did students learn in the school in Alexandria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Scriptural study and of Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What translation of the Old Testament did he study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Septuagint Greek</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the death of the replacement bishop Gregory in 345, Constans used his influence to allow Athanasius to return to Alexandria in October 345, amidst the enthusiastic demonstrations of the populace.

He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold &quot;to bear his charges&quot; but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: &quot;calumny&quot;) and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to bribe Liberius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constantius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much warning was Liberius given before his exile?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Liberius go?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beroea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did bribery work in convincing Liberius to believe the Arians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">were refused</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Liberius have to promise to do in order to return?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comply with the bishops</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When Emperor Constantine I died, Athanasius was allowed to return to his See of Alexandria.

The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control it, at Milan. Milan was named as the place, here three hundred bishops assembled, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of Dionysius (bishop of Milan), and the two Papal Legates, viz., Eusebius of Vercelli and Lucifer of Cagliari, consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius. Those who refused were sent into exile. The decrees were forwarded to the Pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Bishops condemn Athanasius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">threats of the Emperor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the Bishops who did not take the oath?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sent into exile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did the Pope agree with this order?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pope refused to accept</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did the Emperor agree to a new trial for Athanasius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constantius consented</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What oath did the Bishops have to take at the trial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arian formula of faith</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 361, after the death of Emperor Constantius, shortly followed by the murder of the very unpopular Bishop George, Athanasius returned to his patriarchate.

This prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity.
