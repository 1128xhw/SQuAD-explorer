It was initially popularized in Chicago, circa 1984. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, and Newark – all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as &quot;Pump Up The Volume&quot; by MARRS (1987), &quot;House Nation&quot; by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), &quot;Theme from S'Express&quot; by S'Express (1988) and &quot;Doctorin' the House&quot; by Coldcut (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city did House music originate from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chicago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade did House music first develop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was House music first popularized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1984</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What genre does House music fall into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electronic dance music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song by MARRS was an early House hit in 1987?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Pump Up The Volume&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more minimalistic microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres, such as euro house, tech house, electro house and jump house.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">House music is characterized by what type of beats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4/4 beats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some subgenres of House music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">euro house, tech house, electro house and jump house</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are rhythms provided by in House music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drum machines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some differences between House and Disco music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it was more electronic and minimalistic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of music is House based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dance-based music</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the late 1980s, many local Chicago house music artists suddenly found themselves presented with major label deals. House music proved to be a commercially successful genre and a more mainstream pop-based variation grew increasingly popular. Artists and groups such as Madonna, Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, Aretha Franklin, Bananarama, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, Steps, Kylie Minogue, Bjork, and C+C Music Factoryhave all incorporated the genre into some of their work. After enjoying significant success in the early to mid-90s, house music grew even larger during the second wave of progressive house (1999–2001). The genre has remained popular and fused into other popular subgenres, for example, G-house, Deep House, Tech House and Bass House. As of 2015, house music remains extremely popular in both clubs and in the mainstream pop scene while retaining a foothold on underground scenes across the globe.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the second wave of progressive house?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1999–2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some popular subgenres of House?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">G-house, Deep House, Tech House and Bass House</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">where is house music extremely popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both clubs and in the mainstream pop scene</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What variation of house music was produced by artists such as Madonna and Kylie Minogue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a more mainstream pop-based variation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Various disco songs incorporated sounds produced with synthesizers and drum machines, and some compositions were entirely electronic; examples include Giorgio Moroder's late 1970s productions such as Donna Summer's hit single &quot;I Feel Love&quot; from 1977, Cerrone's &quot;Supernature&quot; (1977), Yellow Magic Orchestra's synth-disco-pop productions from Yellow Magic Orchestra (1978), Solid State Survivor (1979), and several early 1980s disco-pop productions by the Hi-NRG group Lime.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instruments did disco songs incorporate from house music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">synthesizers and drum machines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who produced Donna Summer's hit single &quot;I Feel Love&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Giorgio Moroder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what sort of music did Hi-NRG group Lime produce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s disco-pop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Cerrone's &quot;Supernature&quot; get released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1977</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was solid state survivor released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1979</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Soul and disco influenced house music, plus mixing and editing techniques earlier explored by disco, garage music and post-disco DJs, producers, and audio engineers such as Walter Gibbons, Tom Moulton, Jim Burgess, Larry Levan, Ron Hardy, M &amp; M, and others who produced longer, more repetitive, and percussive arrangements of existing disco recordings.

Trax Records and DJ International Records, Chicago labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music inside and outside of Chicago. One 1986 house tune called &quot;Move Your Body&quot; by Marshall Jefferson, taken from the appropriately titled &quot;The House Music Anthem&quot; EP, became a big hit in Chicago and eventually worldwide. By 1986, UK labels were releasing house music by Chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing on and topping the UK music chart.

Clubbers to The Warehouse were primarily black and gay, who came to dance to music played by the club's resident DJ Frankie Knuckles, whom fans refer to as the &quot;godfather of house&quot;. After the Warehouse closed in 1983, the crowds went to Knuckles' new club, The Power Plant. In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up The Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term &quot;house music&quot; was upon seeing &quot;we play house music&quot; on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car with him joked, &quot;you know, that's the kind of music you play down at the Warehouse!&quot;, and then everybody laughed. South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard &quot;Remix&quot; Roy, in self-published statements, claims he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's home; in his case, it referred to his mother's soul &amp; disco records, which he worked into his sets. Farley Jackmaster Funk was quoted as saying &quot;In 1982, I was DJing at a club called The Playground and there was this kid named Leonard 'Remix' Roy who was a DJ at a rival club called The Rink.

Flyers in clubs in Ibiza often sported many corporate logos.
