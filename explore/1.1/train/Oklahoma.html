Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning &quot;red people&quot;. It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans, or informally &quot;Okies&quot;, and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Cherokee name for Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Asgaya gigageyi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Pawnee name for Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uukuhuúwa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Cayuga name for Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gahnawiyoˀgeh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Oklahoma rank by population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Oklahoma's nickname?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Sooner State</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw phrase okla humma, literally meaning red people. Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of Indian Territory, in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word Indian, okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe Native American people as a whole. Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language does the name Oklahoma come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Choctaw</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Oklahoma mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">red people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the name Oklahoma suggested?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1866</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who suggested the name Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Choctaw Chief Allen Wright</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the name Oklahoma made official?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1890</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Oklahoma is the 20th largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,898 square miles (181,035 km2), with 68,667 square miles (177847 km2) of land and 1,281 square miles (3,188 km2) of water.

It was then set along the 103rd Meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered that the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake as it was than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the original surveying error.

Mid-summer (July and August) represents a secondary dry season over much of Oklahoma, with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years. Severe drought is common in the hottest summers, such as those of 1934, 1954, 1980 and 2011, all of which featured weeks on end of virtual rainlessness and high temperatures well over 100 °F (38 °C). Average precipitation rises again from September to mid-October, representing a secondary wetter season, then declines from late October through December.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which season is the most dry in Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">winter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does Oklahoma get the most rain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is the second-driest season in Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mid-summer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years were Oklahoma's hottest summers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1934, 1954, 1980 and 2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How hot were Oklahoma's hottest summers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">well over 100 °F</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>All of the state frequently experiences temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) or below 0 °F (−18 °C), though below-zero temperatures are rare in south-central and southeastern Oklahoma.
