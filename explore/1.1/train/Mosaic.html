Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced Venice, and among the Rus in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What millennium did Mosaic start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 3rd millennium BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of mosaic were made in Tiryns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pebble mosaics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who besides the Romans did the Jewish people get influenced by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Byzantine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did mosaic fall out of fashion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Renaissance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Norman kingdomwas in what italian city state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sicily</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae, and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës, Albania in 1916, is an early figural example; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC. Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders. Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name, describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl.

The tiny tesserae allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting. Often small panels called emblemata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work. The normal technique was opus tessellatum, using larger tesserae, which was laid on site. There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of mosaic uses small tesserae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opus vermiculatum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were small panel mosaics known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emblemata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the mosaic technique that used larger tesserae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opus tessellatum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the benefit of using small pieces to create a mosaic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">very fine detail</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were black and white pieces used in most italian mosaics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cheaper than fully coloured work</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea, built 64 AD, and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites. However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression.

The large villa rustica, which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian, was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the Circus Scene, the 64m long Great Hunting Scene, the Little Hunt, the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls, showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis. The peristyle, the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics. Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus, Alexander the Great's Hunt and the Four Seasons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what area of Italy is the largest collection of mosaics in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sicily</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who most likely lived in the large villa rustica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emperor Maximian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the mosaics at the villa rustica to be protected for centuries? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a landslide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is the hunting scene at the villa rustica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">64m</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in Sicily were the &quot;Orpheus,&quot; and the &quot;Four Seasons&quot; discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Piazza Vittoria in Palermo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1913 the Zliten mosaic, a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests, hunting and everyday life, was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten.

The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana, both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus, which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building. In another great Constantinian basilica, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called Tomb of the Julii, near the crypt beneath St Peter's Basilica, is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki, converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around what century were mosaics adapted for Christian churches?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the late 4th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Christian church besides the Santa Costanza was built in the 4th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Santa Pudenziana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original function of the Santa Costanza church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a mausoleum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which basilica is the Tomb of Julii?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St Peter's Basilica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under what period were the 4th century churches built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Constantinian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the following century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background.

Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ: &quot;As a heart desireth the water brook, so my souls longs for thee, O God.&quot; Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was depicted on the Butrint mosaics in abundance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural life</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the katharos vase and vine refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the eucharist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do peacocks represent in Christian symbolism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paradise and resurrection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do most sea-creatures represent in Christina symbolism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">baptism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did deers or stags represent in Christian Symbolism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the faithful aspiring to Christ</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome, gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages. 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period. Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings. In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti (462–472, destroyed in 1589) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him, six on either side. At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara (468–483, destroyed in 1686) Christ appeared in the center, flanked on either side by three Apostles. Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ. The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ flanked by male and female saints, seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet. All three mosaics had a similar iconography.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did conditions become difficult for mosaic art in Rome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Early Middle Ages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti destroyed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1589</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was similar between the three most important 5th century mosaics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iconography</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the mosaic at Santa Sabina replaced with a fresco?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1559</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the artist that painted the fresco that replaced the mosaic at Santa Sobina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taddeo Zuccari</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede, Santa Maria in Domnica, Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano. The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics. They were all destroyed later except for one example, the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century. Another great work of Pope Leo, the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna, depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side, and SS. Susanna and Felicity on the other. It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585.

Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente, the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1140) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne, the first example of this iconographic scheme. A similar mosaic, the Coronation of the Virgin, decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore. It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295. The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884. The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini, the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective.

The inscription reads: &quot;For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows.&quot; Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries.

Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other, lesser known sites. The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the Pitsunda Cathedral have been inspired by Roman prototypes.

The mosque was built between 706 and 715. The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works. The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard, called the &quot;Barada Panel&quot; after the river Barada. It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world, at over 4 m2. In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively, and many mosaics were lost, although some have been restored since.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the most important Islamic mosaic work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Umayyad Mosque</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the the Umayyad Mosque located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Damascus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the significance of Damascus during this time period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capital of the Arab Caliphate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the largest section of mosaic still present in the Umayyad Mosque?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;Barada Panel&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened in 1893 that destroyed most of the mosaics in the mosque?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a fire</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham's Palace, Palestine which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar, Lebanon. The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat (in present-day Jordan) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill. The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by &quot;good&quot; animals on one side and &quot;bad&quot; animals on the other. Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a leopard, pairs of partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions and a snake. At Qastal, near Amman, excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan, dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (685–705). They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor. The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns, trees, animals, fruits and rosettes. Except for the open courtyard, entrance and staircases, the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Any mosaic having secular designs were likely what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">floor panels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the floor panels of the caliphs and high ranking officials modeled after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman country villas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can the most superb example of Umayyad mosaic floor paneling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the bath house of Hisham's Palace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which present day country would the residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jordan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At Qastal in 2000 the earliest examples of what were found in Jordan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Umayyad mosaics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain. The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character.

The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy.

This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses.

The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, sticky plastic or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved.
