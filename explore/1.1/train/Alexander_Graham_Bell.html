His father was Professor Alexander Melville Bell, a phonetician, and his mother was Eliza Grace (née Symonds). Born as just &quot;Alexander Bell&quot;, at age 10 he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers.[N 6] For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the name &quot;Graham&quot;, chosen out of respect for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his father who had become a family friend.

His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays. Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill. He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years. In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to &quot;invent&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of things did Bell collect as a child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">botanical specimens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Bell's closest friend as a child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ben Herdman</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of mill did Bell's neighbors run?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bell's dehusking machine combined what with nail brushes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rotating paddles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Bell's reward for his dehusking machine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small workshop</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist. Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and &quot;voice tricks&quot; akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits. Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour. He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.

His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his The Standard Elocutionist (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. The Standard Elocutionist appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound. Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Bell's uncle live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dublin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Bell's father most famous for publishing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Standard Elocutionist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bell learned to accurately read lips even without knowing what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pronunciation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Standard Elocutionist was printed how many times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">168</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms. His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father. Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself. At age 16, Bell secured a position as a &quot;pupil-teacher&quot; of elocution and music, in Weston House Academy, at Elgin, Moray, Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session. The following year, he attended the University of Edinburgh; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the University of London.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who taught Bell when he was very young?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">father</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What school did Bell leave at 15?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal High School</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Bell's favorite subject?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Bell when he became a &quot;pupil-teacher&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>His father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique automaton, developed by Sir Charles Wheatstone based on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. The rudimentary &quot;mechanical man&quot; simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a &quot;big prize&quot; if they were successful. While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could &quot;speak&quot;, albeit only a few words. The boys would carefully adjust the &quot;lips&quot; and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable &quot;Mama&quot; ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Bell's father take him to see an automaton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1863</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the automaton Bell saw?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Charles Wheatstone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the automaton mimic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">human voice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bell built his own automaton with who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Melville</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the automaton did Bell create?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">skull</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, &quot;Trouve&quot;.

Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material did Elisha Gray use to convey sound?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">water</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Gray and Bell both put in for a patent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 14, 1876</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what day did Bell get to Washington?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 26</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What office in Washington did Bell and Gray visit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. Patent Office</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of machine did Bell and Gray both try to patent at the same time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">telephone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the U.S. Patent Office.

They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the Dhonnas Beag, the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil. The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD-4, powered by Renault engines. A top speed of 54 miles per hour (87 km/h) was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 horsepower (260 kilowatts) engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour (114.04 kilometres per hour), a record which stood for ten years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what country did Baldwin and Forlanini get together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Baldwin liken the hydrofoil boat to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">flying</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which boat was first powered by a Renault engine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">HD-4</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1898, Bell experimented with tetrahedral box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk.[N 23] The tetrahedral wings were named Cygnet I, II and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned (Cygnet I crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912.

Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the Red Wing, framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine. On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.[N 24] [N 25] The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control). One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft. [N 26] The White Wing and June Bug were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments. Lt. Selfridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the AEA work on after kites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gliders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What material was the Red Wing's frame made of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bamboo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of plane was the Red Wing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biplane</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many accident-free flights had the AEA taken by 1909?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">150</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first person to die in a plane crash?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Selfridge</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Their final aircraft design, the Silver Dart, embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines.

In his lecture Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry. However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist David Starr Jordan's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the American Breeders' Association. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man. From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a &quot;defective variety of the human race.&quot; By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of parents did Bell state were more prone to having deaf children?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">congenitally deaf parents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1921 the American Museum of Natural History hosted what event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second International Congress of Eugenics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which biologist ran the Committee on Eugenics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Starr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Bell like to do that led to his involvement with eugenics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">livestock breeding</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A large number of Bell's writings, personal correspondence, notebooks, papers and other documents reside at both the United States Library of Congress Manuscript Division (as the Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers), and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute, Cape Breton University, Nova Scotia; major portions of which are available for online viewing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Bell's personal papers known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what part of the Library of Congress are Bell's papers kept?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manuscript Division</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Apart from in person, how can one look at many of Bell's papers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">online</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what university is the Alexander Graham Bell Institute?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cape Breton University</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what province is the Alexander Graham Bell Institute located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nova Scotia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$250,000 in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' (1880), also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his &quot;proudest achievement&quot;, &quot;the photophone&quot;, the &quot;optical telephone&quot; which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Adjusted for inflation, how many dollars were awarded to Bell alongside the Volta Prize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$250,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Victor Hugo and what other author helped judge the Volta Prize in 1880?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexandre Dumas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first established the Volta Prize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Napoleon Bonaparte</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Volta lab improved the phonograph by replacing tinfoil with what substance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wax</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Bell-founded institution still operates in Georgetown today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Volta Bureau</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In partnership with Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s.
