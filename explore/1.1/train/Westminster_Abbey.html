It is one of the most notable religious buildings in the United Kingdom and has been the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and, later, British monarchs. Between 1540 and 1556 the abbey had the status of a cathedral. Since 1560, however, the building is no longer an abbey nor a cathedral, having instead the status of a Church of England &quot;Royal Peculiar&quot;â€”a church responsible directly to the sovereign. The building itself is the original abbey church.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Westminster Abbey's original name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What style architecture is the Westminster Abbey considered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gothic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city is Westminster Abbey located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">City of Westminster, London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what years was the Abbey considered a cathedral?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Between 1540 and 1556</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of building is the Abbey now considered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Peculiar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the formal name of Westminster Abbey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Westminster Abbey located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">City of Westminster, London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Westminster Abbey a cathedral?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Between 1540 and 1556</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has been the status of Westminster Abbey since 1560?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Church of England &quot;Royal Peculiar&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080, a church was founded at the site (then known as Thorn Ey (Thorn Island)) in the 7th century, at the time of Mellitus, a Bishop of London.
