Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did England propose to affiliate with Wales to quell Welsh nationalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elizabeth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Britain not want Elizabeth to associate with conscientious objectors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Britain was at war</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Elizabeth join in 1946?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Welsh Gorsedd of Bards</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the always the Prince of Wales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heir apparent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wanted to name Elizabeth Princess of Wales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Herbert Morrison</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey.

The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, &quot;the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought—she hoped—given time, the affair would peter out.&quot; Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession. Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend. In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year.

Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments. Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the Earl of Home as prime minister, advice that she followed. The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.

Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth—which were contradicted by the Palace—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.

The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Jubilee did Elizabeth celebrate in 1977?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Silver</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Princess Margaret separate from her husband?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1977</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Nicolae Ceausescu visit the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1978</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who, in 1979, was discovered to be a communist spy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anthony Blunt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group assassinated Lord Mountbatten?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Provisional Irish Republican Army</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous &quot;fairytale Queen&quot;.

In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales.

Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music. Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family. The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility. Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as &quot;a character.

The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, &quot;I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.&quot; In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name was it assumed Elizabeth would take upon her marriage to Philip?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mountbatten,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Prime Minister objected to the name change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Winston Churchill</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name did Elizabeth keep as her married name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Windsor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name was adopted for Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not have royal titles? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mountbatten-Windsor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Elizabeth decree the use of Mountbatten-Windsor as the  surname? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The absence of a formal mechanism within the Conservative Party for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to commission to form a government.

As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: &quot;Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.&quot; Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: &quot;The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.&quot; It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed &quot;the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making&quot;. Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a &quot;behind the scenes force&quot; in ending apartheid.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did high public interest in the  private lives of the royal family cause in the press?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sensational stories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was editor of The Sun in the 1980s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kelvin MacKenzie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the editor of The Observer call the sensational stories about the royals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">royal soap opera</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who, it was rumored,  did Margaret Thatcher say the Queen would vote for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thatcher's political opponents</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said the Elizabeth was a behind the scenes force in ending apartheid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brian Mulroney</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris.

The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated £200,000 to charity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Elizabeth's speech on 24 November, 1992 mark?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her accession</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Elizabeth call her past year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">annus horribilis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Price Andrew separate from his wife?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Princess Anne divorce in April?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Captain Mark Phillips</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What great house caught fire in November?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Windsor Castle</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In May 2007, The Daily Telegraph, citing unnamed sources, reported that the Queen was &quot;exasperated and frustrated&quot; by the policies of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair. She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. On 20 March 2008, at the Church of Ireland St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, the Queen attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales. At the invitation of the Irish President, Mary McAleese, the Queen made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who, in 2007, frustrated Elizabeth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prime Minister, Tony Blair</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What issue of Blair's did Elizabeth admire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peace in Northern Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Elizabeth attend a service at Armagm, in Ireland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 March 2008</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What service did Elizabeth attend in Armagm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maundy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Elizabeth make the first visit to Ireland by a British monarch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 2011.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Queen surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch in December 2007, and the longest-reigning British monarch on 9 September 2015.

Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1977</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What increased in the 1980s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">public criticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main subject of public criticism in the 80's?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">royal family</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What attribute of Elizabeth fell to  low in the 1990s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">popularity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Elizabeth start paying in the 1990 s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">income tax</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Elizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world.
