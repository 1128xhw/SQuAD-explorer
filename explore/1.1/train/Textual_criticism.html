Ancient scribes made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text (the archetype or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history. The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a &quot;critical edition&quot; containing a scholarly curated text.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of documents does a textual critic usually analyze?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the goal of the textual critic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the production of a &quot;critical edition&quot; containing a scholarly curated text.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the proper name for textual scholarship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">philology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are there differences in ancient copies of the same text?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ancient scribes made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do textual critics call a revised edition of a text?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">recensions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many ancient works, such as the Bible and the Greek tragedies,[citation needed] survive in hundreds of copies, and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear.

The principles of textual criticism, although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity, the Bible, and Shakespeare, have been applied to many works, extending backwards from the present to the earliest known written documents, in Mesopotamia and Egypt—a period of about five millennia. However, the application of textual criticism to non-religious works does not antedate the invention of printing.

The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be eclectic. In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are there multiple variations of texts before the advent of the printing press?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literature was copied by hand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are printed editions immune to variation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do differences in works arise when using a printing press?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">An edited text compiled through many sources is known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eclectic.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When comparing different documents, or &quot;witnesses&quot;, of a single, original text, the observed differences are called variant readings, or simply variants or readings. It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be un-original, hence establishing a &quot;critical text&quot;, or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both &quot;external&quot; evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and &quot;internal&quot; or &quot;physical&quot; considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Different documents that represent the same original text are called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">witnesses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the variations in the text of witnesses known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">variant readings, or simply variants or readings.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How or why do variations enter a witness text?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As well as representing the original text, a critical text must also do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">document variant readings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is it important to document variations in witness texts when compiling a critical text?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The collation of all known variants of a text is referred to as a variorum, namely a work of textual criticism whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication.

For the same reasons, the most geographically diverse witnesses are preferred. Some manuscripts show evidence that particular care was taken in their composition, for example, by including alternative readings in their margins, demonstrating that more than one prior copy (exemplar) was consulted in producing the current one. Other factors being equal, these are the best witnesses. The role of the textual critic is necessary when these basic criteria are in conflict.

Karl Lachmann (1793–1851) greatly contributed to making this method famous, even though he did not invent it. The method takes its name from the word stemma. The Ancient Greek word στέμματα and its loanword in classical Latin stemmata may refer to &quot;family trees&quot;. This specific meaning shows the relationships of the surviving witnesses (the first known example of such a stemma, albeit with the name, dates from 1827). The family tree is also referred to as a cladogram. The method works from the principle that &quot;community of error implies community of origin.&quot; That is, if two witnesses have a number of errors in common, it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source, called a hyparchetype. Relations between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process, placing all extant manuscripts in a family tree or stemma codicum descended from a single archetype. The process of constructing the stemma is called recension, or the Latin recensio.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is stemmatics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a rigorous approach to textual criticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a cladogram?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The family tree is also referred to as a cladogram.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is implied when two witnesses have a number of errors in common?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a hyparchetype?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a common intermediate source</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is recension?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The process of constructing the stemma</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The process of selectio resembles eclectic textual criticism, but applied to a restricted set of hypothetical hyparchetypes.

He concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance, and that therefore, the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses. He suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches, as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment (as there would be no third branch to &quot;break the tie&quot; whenever the witnesses disagreed).

The manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics. The difference between cladistics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that, rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity, cladistics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them. This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics. However, where there is a difference, the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text, and so does not indicate which branch of the tree is the &quot;root&quot;—which manuscript tradition is closest to the original.

To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by Joseph Smith to his scribes) and the Printer’s Manuscript (the copy Oliver Cowdery prepared for the Printer in 1829–1830), and compared them with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original.

He also closely examined the Printer’s Manuscript (owned by the Community of Christ—RLDS Church in Independence, Missouri) for differences in types of ink or pencil, in order to determine when and by whom they were made. He also collated the various editions of the Book of Mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was phase one completed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took over after the preliminary phase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Professor Skousen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Professor Skousen gather fragments and have them analyzed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to obtain fine readings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process what used to study the gathered fragments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">advanced photographic techniques</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what did Skousen analyze ink and pencil remnants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Printer’s Manuscript</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Shemaryahu Talmon, who summarized the amount of consensus and genetic relation to the Urtext of the Hebrew Bible, concluded that major divergences which intrinsically affect the sense are extremely rare. As far as the Hebrew Bible referenced by Old Testament is concerned, almost all of the textual variants are fairly insignificant and hardly affect any doctrine. Professor Douglas Stuart states: &quot;It is fair to say that the verses, chapters, and books of the Bible would read largely the same, and would leave the same impression with the reader, even if one adopted virtually every possible alternative reading to those now serving as the basis for current English translations.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How common are variations in text that alter the meaning of the Urtext of the Hebrew Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">extremely rare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what degree do variations in the Old Testament alter the meaning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hardly affect any doctrine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who claims that the Old Testament is essentially the same throughout all variations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Professor Douglas Stuart</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many variations of the Old Testament offer the same meaning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">virtually every possible alternative reading</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While textual criticism developed into a discipline of thorough analysis of the Bible — both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament — scholars also use it to determine the original content of classic texts, such as Plato's Republic. There are far fewer witnesses to classical texts than to the Bible, so scholars can use stemmatics and, in some cases, copy text editing. However, unlike the New Testament where the earliest witnesses are within 200 years of the original, the earliest existing manuscripts of most classical texts were written about a millennium after their composition. All things being equal, textual scholars expect that a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does the Bible or Plato's Republic have more witnesses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">There are far fewer witnesses to classical texts than to the Bible</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's the gap between original Christian texts and subsequent editions of the same works?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">within 200 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's the gap between original classical texts and subsequent editions of the same works?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about a millennium after their composition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the expanse of time correlate to authenticity with regard to original and subsequent versions of texts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Scientific and critical editions can be protected by copyright as works of authorship if enough creativity/originality is provided.
