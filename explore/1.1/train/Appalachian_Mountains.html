The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period and once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before they were eroded. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to any road running east-west.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Appalachian mountains called in French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">les Appalaches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Appalachian mountains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a system of mountains in eastern North America</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Appalachian mountains form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">roughly 480 million years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what era did the mountains form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ordovician Period</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Definitions vary on the precise boundaries of the Appalachians.

After the French and Indian War, the Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement for Great Britain's thirteen original colonies in North America to east of the summit line of the mountains (except in the northern regions where the Great Lakes formed the boundary). Although the line was adjusted several times to take frontier settlements into account and was impossible to enforce as law, it was strongly resented by backcountry settlers throughout the Appalachians. The Proclamation Line can be seen as one of the grievances which led to the American Revolutionary War. Many frontier settlers held that the defeat of the French opened the land west of the mountains to English settlement, only to find settlement barred by the British King's proclamation.

The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal chestnut blight (Cryphonectaria parasitica), but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots, which are not killed by the fungus. In present-day forest canopies chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trees are typically found in the dryer portions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oak</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species of tree was pretty much eliminated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The American chestnut</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the tree live on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sapling-sized sprouts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trees replaced chestnut trees?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oaks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of black, northern red, white, chestnut and scarlet oaks (Quercus velutina, Q. rubra, Q. alba, Q. prinus and Q. coccinea) and hickories, such as the pignut (Carya glabra) in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly white and northern red oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and northern red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of oaks are in the central and southern portions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">black, northern red, white, chestnut and scarlet oaks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other tree is common there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hickories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trees are located in drier portions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chestnut oak</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
