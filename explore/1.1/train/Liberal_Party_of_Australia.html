Historically, the party has supported a higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism than it has in recent decades. However, from its foundation the party has identified itself as anti-socialist. Strong opposition to socialism and communism in Australia and abroad was one of its founding principles. The party's founder and longest-serving leader Robert Menzies envisaged that Australia's middle class would form its main constituency.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is economic liberalism sometimes also referred to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Right</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does the Liberal Party of Australia consider itself socialist or anti-socialist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-socialist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Liberal Party of Australia's longest-serving leader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Menzies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Australia's liberal party?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Menzies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Throughout their history, the Liberals have been in electoral terms largely the party of the middle class (whom Menzies, in the era of the party's formation called &quot;The forgotten people&quot;), though such class-based voting patterns are no longer as clear as they once were. In the 1970s a left-wing middle class emerged that no longer voted Liberal.[citation needed] One effect of this was the success of a breakaway party, the Australian Democrats, founded in 1977 by former Liberal minister Don Chipp and members of minor liberal parties; other members of the left-leaning section of the middle-class became Labor supporters.[citation needed] On the other hand, the Liberals have done increasingly well in recent years among socially conservative working-class voters.[citation needed]However the Liberal Party's key support base remains the upper-middle classes; 16 of the 20 richest federal electorates are held by the Liberals, most of which are safe seats. In country areas they either compete with or have a truce with the Nationals, depending on various factors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whom are referred to as &quot;The forgoten people?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the middle class</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were the Australian Democrats founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1977</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which former liberal founded the Australian Democrats in 1977?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Don Chipp</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Domestically, Menzies presided over a fairly regulated economy in which utilities were publicly owned, and commercial activity was highly regulated through centralised wage-fixing and high tariff protection. Liberal leaders from Menzies to Malcolm Fraser generally maintained Australia's high tariff levels. At that time the Liberals' coalition partner, the Country Party, the older of the two in the coalition (now known as the &quot;National Party&quot;), had considerable influence over the government's economic policies. It was not until the late 1970s and through their period out of power federally in the 1980s that the party came to be influenced by what was known as the &quot;New Right&quot; â€“ a conservative liberal group who advocated market deregulation, privatisation of public utilities, reductions in the size of government programs and tax cuts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did Mezies and Malcom Fraser raise, mainain, or lower tariff levels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">generally maintain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group is currently known as the &quot;National Party&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Country Party</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the &quot;New Right&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a conservative liberal group who advocated market deregulation, privatisation of public utilities, reductions in the size of government programs and tax cuts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were utilities publically or privately owned in Menzie's economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">publicly</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Liberals' immediate predecessor was the United Australia Party (UAP). More broadly, the Liberal Party's ideological ancestry stretched back to the anti-Labor groupings in the first Commonwealth parliaments. The Commonwealth Liberal Party was a fusion of the Free Trade Party and the Protectionist Party in 1909 by the second prime minister, Alfred Deakin, in response to Labor's growing electoral prominence. The Commonwealth Liberal Party merged with several Labor dissidents (including Billy Hughes) to form the Nationalist Party of Australia in 1917. That party, in turn, merged with Labor dissidents to form the UAP in 1931.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group was predecessor to the Liberals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Australia Party (UAP)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where did the ideology of the Liberals stem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anti-Labor groupings in the first Commonwealth parliaments</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Commonwealth Liberal Party merge to form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nationalist Party of Australia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Nationalist Party of Australia formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1917</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The UAP had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector Joseph Lyons as its leader. The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the Lyons Government went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided Keynesian pump-priming and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941 but resigned as leader of the minority World War II government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the 1943 election.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What economic event influenced the 1931 Election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Great Depression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many consecutive elections did the Lyons Government win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event caused Robert Menzies to become Prime Minister?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lyons' death in 1939</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did Robert Menzies serve as Prime Minister?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1939 to 1941</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Menzies called a conference of conservative parties and other groups opposed to the ruling Australian Labor Party, which met in Canberra on 13 October 1944 and again in Albury, New South Wales in December 1944.

The Australian Women's National League, a powerful conservative women's organisation, also merged with the new party. A conservative youth group Menzies had set up, the Young Nationalists, was also merged into the new party. It became the nucleus of the Liberal Party's youth division, the Young Liberals.

While himself an unashamed anglophile, Menzies' government concluded a number of major defence and trade treaties that set Australia on its post-war trajectory out of Britain's orbit; opened Australia to multi-ethnic immigration; and instigated important legal reforms regarding Aboriginal Australians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years did the Liberals stay in office after the 1949 election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a record 23 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What promises did Menzies make in the 1949 election?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">end rationing of butter, tea and petrol and provided a five-shilling endowment for first-born children</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what period did Australia experience long-term economic growth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the post-war boom period of the Menzies Government (1949â€“1966)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Menzies came to power the year the Communist Party of Australia had led a coal strike to improve pit miners' working conditions.

Anti-communism was a key political issue of the 1950s and 1960s. Menzies was firmly anti-Communist; he committed troops to the Korean War and attempted to ban the Communist Party of Australia in an unsuccessful referendum during the course of that war.

The Menzies Government entered Australia's first formal military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States in San Francisco in 1951. External Affairs Minister Percy Spender had put forward the proposal to work along similar lines to the NATO Alliance. The Treaty declared that any attack on one of the three parties in the Pacific area would be viewed as a threat to each, and that the common danger would be met in accordance with each nation's constitutional processes. In 1954 the Menzies Government signed the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty (SEATO) as a South East Asian counterpart to NATO. That same year, Soviet diplomat Vladimir Petrov and his wife defected from the Soviet embassy in Canberra, revealing evidence of Russian spying activities; Menzies called a Royal Commission to investigate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which treaty was Australia's first military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ANZUS Treaty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which areas were involved in the ANZUS Treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australia, New Zealand and the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the acronym SEATO stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group is a counterpart to NATO?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty (SEATO)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the signing of the ANZUS Treaty held in 1951?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">San Francisco</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Menzies continued the expanded immigration program established under Chifley, and took important steps towards dismantling the White Australia Policy. In the early 1950s, external affairs minister Percy Spender helped to establish the Colombo Plan for providing economic aid to underdeveloped nations in Australia's region. Under that scheme many future Asian leaders studied in Australia. In 1958 the government replaced the Immigration Act's arbitrarily applied European language dictation test with an entry permit system, that reflected economic and skills criteria. In 1962, Menzies' Commonwealth Electoral Act provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections (prior to this, indigenous people in Queensland, Western Australia and some in the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were ex-servicemen). In 1949 the Liberals appointed Dame Enid Lyons as the first woman to serve in an Australian Cabinet. Menzies remained a staunch supporter of links to the monarchy and British Commonwealth but formalised an alliance with the United States and concluded the Agreement on Commerce between Australia and Japan which was signed in July 1957 and launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Immigration Act's entry permit system include?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">economic and skills criteria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ruling allowed indigenous Australians the right to vote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Menzies' Commonwealth Electoral Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first women to serve on the Australian Cabinet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dame Enid Lyons</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Holt increased Australian commitment to the growing War in Vietnam, which met with some public opposition.

His government included the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian, Neville Bonner, and in 1976, Parliament passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976, which, while limited to the Northern Territory, affirmed &quot;inalienable&quot; freehold title to some traditional lands. Fraser established the multicultural broadcaster SBS, accepted Vietnamese refugees, opposed minority white rule in Apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia and opposed Soviet expansionism. A significant program of economic reform however was not pursued. By 1983, the Australian economy was suffering with the early 1980s recession and amidst the effects of a severe drought. Fraser had promoted &quot;states' rights&quot; and his government refused to use Commonwealth powers to stop the construction of the Franklin Dam in Tasmania in 1982. Liberal minister, Don Chipp split off from the party to form a new social liberal party, the Australian Democrats in 1977. Fraser won further substantial majorities at the 1977 and 1980 elections, before losing to the Bob Hawke led Australian Labor Party in the 1983 election.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which document allowed Indigenous peoples the right to some traditional lands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What environmental consequence affected the Australian economy by 1983?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a severe drought</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party did Don Chipp seperate to form in 1977?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Australian Democrats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Frazer eventually lose to in 1983?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bob Hawke</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Howard differed from his Labor predecessor Paul Keating in that he supported traditional Australian institutions like the Monarchy in Australia, the commemoration of ANZAC Day and the design of the Australian flag, but like Keating he pursued privatisation of public utilities and the introduction of a broad based consumption tax (although Keating had dropped support for a GST by the time of his 1993 election victory).

The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document âˆ’ a radical collection of &quot;dry&quot;, economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises âˆ’ representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST âˆ’ leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two title holders fought for political power in the early 1990s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Australian unemployment rate in 1992?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11.4%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What discussion proved an example of the difficulty of explaining what foods were and were not included in the Goods and Services Tax?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the infamous birthday cake interview</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In South Australia, initially a Liberal and Country Party affiliated party, the Liberal and Country League (LCL), mostly led by Premier of South Australia Tom Playford, was in power from the 1933 election to the 1965 election, though with assistance from an electoral malapportionment, or gerrymander, known as the Playmander.
