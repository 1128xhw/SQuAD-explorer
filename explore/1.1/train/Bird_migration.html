Anecdotal reports of them flying much higher have yet to be corroborated with any direct evidence. Seabirds fly low over water but gain altitude when crossing land, and the reverse pattern is seen in landbirds. However most bird migration is in the range of 150 to 600 m (490 to 1,970 ft).

For example, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco Junco hyemalis migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. Some ducks, such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics.

These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great difficulty crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some large broad-winged birds rely on to help them soar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thermal columns of rising hot air</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When do large birds of pray migrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">daytime</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the heaviest migratory funnels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Batumi bottleneck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of their body weight do honey buzzards lose during migration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 to 20%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many birds funnel through Batumi, Georgia each year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hundreds of thousands</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many of the smaller insectivorous birds including the warblers, hummingbirds and flycatchers migrate large distances, usually at night.

A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's magnetic field, but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a radical pair mechanism whereby chemical reactions in special photo pigments sensitive to long wavelengths are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a boy scout with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this &quot;mapping&quot; is done by magnetites in the trigeminal system, which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination. There is a neural connection between the eye and &quot;Cluster N&quot;, the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may actually be able to see the magnetic field of the earth.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two electromagnetic tools do birds use to find their destinations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the neural connection that is active during migration located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between the eye and &quot;Cluster N&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Cluster N?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a young bird on it's first migration compared to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a boy scout with a compass but no map</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the magnetic field help the bird at different latitudes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">let it know when it has reached its destination</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Migrating birds can lose their way and appear outside their normal ranges.

However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route is believed to be the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other factors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage increase in flight distance will often be adaptive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of bird flies less efficiently?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a bird that loads itself with food</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of bird show circuitous migratory routes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Swainson's thrush</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do Swainson's thrush fly from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">far east across North America</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Large scale climatic changes, as have been experienced in the past, are expected to have an effect on the timing of migration.

Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West Nile Virus may however be spread by migrating birds.

The populations of Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs have also been known to affect migratory birds. Other migration hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What threatens some bird species?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hunting along migration routes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What species declined due to hunting in Afghanistand and Asia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Siberian cranes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were birds last seen in Keoladeo National Park?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can power lines, wind farms and oil rigs affect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">migratory birds</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are other migration hazards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
