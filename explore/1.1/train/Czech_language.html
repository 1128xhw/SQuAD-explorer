Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II) literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech. Since then, &quot;Czechoslovak&quot; refers to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who called themselves &quot;Czechoslavs&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a group of 19th-century scholars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Czechoslavs consider Czech and Slovak to be a single language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The similarities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first Czechoslovak Republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1918–1938</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was standard written Slovak partially modeled on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literary Czech</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Prague Spring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1968</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Around the sixth century AD, a tribe of Slavs arrived in a portion of Central Europe.

These missionaries, Constantine and Methodius, helped to convert the Czechs from traditional Slavic paganism to Christianity and established a church system. They also brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the West Slavs, whose language was previously unwritten. This language, later known as Proto-Czech, was beginning to separate from its fellow West Slavic hatchlings Proto-Slovak, Proto-Polish and Proto-Sorbian.

The publication of the Kralice Bible spawned widespread nationalism, and in 1615 the government of Bohemia ruled that only Czech-speaking residents would be allowed to become full citizens or inherit goods or land. This, and the conversion of the Czech upper classes from the Habsburg Empire's Catholicism to Protestantism, angered the Habsburgs and helped trigger the Thirty Years' War (where the Czechs were defeated at the Battle of White Mountain).

Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech. Although Czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a Slavic language, this interest has focused primarily on modern standard Czech and ancient texts rather than dialects.

This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as &quot;I would&quot; or &quot;I wish&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What verb form is found in Czech dictionaries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infinitive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many grammatical moods do Czech verbs have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the grammatical moods of Czech verbs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">indicative, imperative and conditional</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mood adds specific endings for each of three person or number categories?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">imperative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Czech verb mood indicates possible events?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conditional</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet. As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words. The háček (ˇ) is used with certain letters to form new characters: š, ž, and č, as well as ň, ě, ř, ť, and ď (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (ʼ, an abbreviated háček) because of their height. The character ó exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Czech</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many graphemes does Czech have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thirty-one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have some of Czech's characters been used for by phonologists to denote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">corresponding sounds in other languages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What character in Czech only exists in loanwords?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ó</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Czech, what type of words do the characters &quot;q&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and &quot;x&quot; exclusively appear in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">foreign</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Czech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most Latin European languages, including English. Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in German (1.). In proper noun phrases (except personal names), only the first word is capitalized (Pražský hrad, Prague Castle).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Czech typographical features not associated with phonetics tend to resemble?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those of most Latin European languages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Czech, what is done to proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capitalized</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is typical in Czech as other Latin European languages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">punctuation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language does Czech share its handling of ordinal format with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word is capitalized in proper noun phrases in Czech?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only the first</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
