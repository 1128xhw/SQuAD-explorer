The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world, with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15% of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013.

The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis, a central focus of the wider European debt crisis, plunged the economy into a sharp downturn, with real GDP growth rates of −0.3% in 2008, −4.3% in 2009, −5.5% in 2010, −9.1% in 2011, −7.3% in 2012 and −3.2% in 2013. In 2011, the country's public debt reached €356 billion (172% of nominal GDP). After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector, Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion (137% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2012. Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7% in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline, but fell back into recession in 2015.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years of economic growth was called Greece's economic miracle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950 to 1980</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what year was Greece's levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the GDP growth rate of Greece in 2013?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">−3.2%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much public debt did Greece have in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">€356 billion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Greece fall back into recession?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2015</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century (a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution) has been little researched.

In line with the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2013 and for several months, Greece produced more than 20% of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation, however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of Greece's energy consumption came from renewable sources in 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was EU average amount of energy from renewable sources in 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does most of Greece's renewable energy come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biomass and waste recycling</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of Greece's energy is targeted to be from renewable sources by 2020?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who suggested research into the possibility of a Greek nuclear power plant should begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Academy of Athens</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In addition to the above, Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea, as well as the Libyan Sea, within the Greek exclusive economic zone, south of Crete.

After signing the Maastricht Treaty, Greece applied to join the eurozone. The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3% of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60% of GDP. Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account. On 1 January 2001, Greece joined the eurozone, with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1. However, in 2001 the euro only existed electronically, so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002. This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro, which ended on 1 March 2012.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the currency of Greece until 2002?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drachma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Greece sign to apply to join the eurozone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maastricht Treaty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many convergence criteria were there in the treaty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the physical exchange of the drachma to euro take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the ten-year period for eligible exchange of the drachma to euro end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 2012</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>IMF's forecast said that Greece's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014.
