He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era, whose &quot;poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.&quot; Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Frédéric's nationalities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polish and French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what era was Frédéric active in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romantic era</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what instrument did Frédéric write primarily for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">solo piano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what area was Frédéric born in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Duchy of Warsaw</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Frédéric depart from Poland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Chopin born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1810</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What era was Chopin active during?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romantic era</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Chopin grow up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Warsaw</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instrument did he mostly compose for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">solo piano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Chopin  leave Poland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chopin die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 October 1849</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Chopin's full name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The majority of Chopin's compositions were for what instrument?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">solo piano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Chopin was active during what era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romantic era</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Chopin born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1810</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city was Chopin born and raised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Warsaw</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Chopin when he left Poland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what era of music did Chopin compose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romantic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Chopin die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1849</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the age of 21 he settled in Paris. Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health. He died in Paris in 1849, probably of tuberculosis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Frédéric move to Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many public performances was Frédéric estimated to have given during the remainder of his life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Frédéric obtain citizenship in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1835</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what area had Frédéric's most productive period of composition taken place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Majorca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Frédéric's most likely cause of death?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tuberculosis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did he end up living when he was 21?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many public shows did he perform during the last years of his life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other composer did Chopin develop a friendship with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Franz Liszt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did he gain citizenship in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1835</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the woman he had a relationship with from 1837-847?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maria Wodzińska</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Chopin move to Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the last 18 years he lived about how many times did Chopin perform in public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Chopin become a citizen of France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1835</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the last years of his life who was the person that supported him financially?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jane Stirling</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Chopin become a French citizen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1835</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave Chopin money in the last years of his life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jane Stirling</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the likely cause of death for Chopin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tuberculosis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>All of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his compositional style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the music of all of whom he admired, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instrument did every composition by Frédéric include?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">piano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concept was Frédéric credited with creating?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">instrumental ballade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose music did Frédéric admire the most and thus provide influence on his work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">J.

Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Brochów.

Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the Polish language in the household.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Frédéric's father marry in 1806?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Justyna Krzyżanowska</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was Frédéric baptised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23 April 1810</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language did Frédéric's father, Nicolas, insist on using in the household?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the given name of Chopin's father?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nicolas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Chopin's father from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lorraine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Chopin's father married who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Justyna Krzyżanowska</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Chopin's godfather?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fryderyk Skarbek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Chopin's eldest sister?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ludwika</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Chopin's father's first name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nicolas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where id Chopin's father emigrate from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lorraine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Chopin's older sister's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ludwika</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In October 1810, six months after Fryderyk's birth, the family moved to Warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching French at the Warsaw Lyceum, then housed in the Saxon Palace.

He was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ, the &quot;eolomelodicon&quot;, and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by Moscheles. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1.

On 11 August, three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made his debut in Vienna. He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting (in Chopin's own words) that he was &quot;too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists&quot;. In one of these concerts, he premiered his Variations on Là ci darem la mano, Op. 2 (variations on an aria from Mozart's opera Don Giovanni) for piano and orchestra.

A genius.&quot; On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: &quot;Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...&quot; After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave Frédéric his first significant public approval in regards to his compositions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Schumann</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Frédéric give his first performance at the Salle Pleyel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">26 February 1832</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is stated as a hindrance for Frédéric's ability to perform in large concert spaces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">intimate keyboard technique</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Frédéric rely upon financially before earning a great income from his works?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his father</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From whom did Chopin receive his first big endorsement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Schumann</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chopin debut at Salle Pleyel ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">26 February 1832</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What affluent family did Chopin gain a patronage from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rothschild</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chopin receive his first major endorsement from Robert Schumann?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1831</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Chopin realize was not ideal for larger spaces after his first successful concert in Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">keyboard technique</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Once Chopin stopped performing concerts, how did he earn his income?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that &quot;As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances—few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.&quot; The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Frédéric's favorite environment to perform in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What instrument did Frédéric play in a performance on 23 March 1833?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pianos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Chopin gave a yearly performance where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Salle Pleyel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Chopin worked with Liszt on what piece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hexameron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1833 with whom with Chopin work to get his music published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maurice Schlesinger</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Chopin's pupil who performed with him?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adolphe Gutmann</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Chopin prefer to play for people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">apartment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On March 23, 1833, who headlined and performed with Chopin at a concert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liszt and Hiller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Chopin contract with for publishing his music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maurice Schlesinger</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as &quot;a very agreeable day&quot;, playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him &quot;a perfect musician&quot;. In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Frédéric meet in the spring of 1834 at the Lower Rhenish Music Festival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Felix Mendelssohn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two activities did Frédéric do while visiting for a day in Düsseldorf with Mendelssohn and Hiller?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">playing and discussing music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the director of the Academy of Art that Frédéric met while in Düsseldorf?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were Frédéric's parents located at when he saw them for the final time in 1835?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carlsbad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Chopin meet Felix Mendelssohn?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Lower Rhenish Music Festival</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Chopin attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hiller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1835 where did Chopin and his parents visit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Carlsbad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chopin propose marriage to Maria Wodziński?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 1836</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Maria's mother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Countess Wodzińska</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Chopin meet at a music festival early in 1834?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Felix Mendelssohn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Chopin and Hiller go with the person Chopin met in the spring of 1834?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Düsseldorf</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">director of the Academy of Art</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first name of the girl Chopin proposed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maria</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that &quot;I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.—also Kalkbrenner.

Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a &quot;tinge of jealousy and spite&quot; towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, &quot;I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.&quot; However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as &quot;my friend Liszt&quot;. Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term describes the qualities of the relationship between Frédéric and Liszt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">love-hate relationship</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What three qualities of Liszt are stated to have captivated Frédéric?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">theatricality, showmanship and success</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Frédéric receive from Liszt when the latter performed a nocturne with certain embellishments added?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an apology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Frédéric introduce Liszt as in when referring to him in his letters up to 1848?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">my friend Liszt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What piece did Chopin dedicate to Liszt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Op. 10 Études</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Liszt's mistress?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marie d'Agoult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Chopin dedicate the Op. 10 Études to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liszt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who apologized to Chopin for adding embellishments to a musical piece he perforemed that was written by Chopin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Liszt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Liszt's mistress?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marie d'Agoult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Chopin write to displaying his desire to take away a performers ability to play his music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hiller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the man who biogrpahers think Chopin was concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Sand</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin). Short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, &quot;What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?&quot; However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzińska's mother had made it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed. It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand. Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, &quot;My tragedy&quot;. Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the host of the gathering where Frédéric was introduced to George Sand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marie d'Agoult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Frédéric label the place in which he placed Maria and her mother's letters about the unlikely marriage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">My tragedy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did George Sand write to when admitting having a strong affection for Frédéric?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grzymała</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the author Chopin met at a gathering put on by Marie d'Agoult?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Sand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a possible reason for Chopin's failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his poor health</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Chopin write on the box of letters from Maria and her mother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">My tragedy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who hosted the party whre Chopin met George Sand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marie d'Agoult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Maria Wodzińska's mother tell Chopin that he likely would not marry her daughter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1837</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Chopin write on the package that contained letters from Maria and her mother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">My tragedy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Sand confide to in a letter about her feelings for Chopin in June, 1838?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grzymała</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: &quot;I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ...

After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city did Frédéric visit in June 1837?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event occurred on Frédéric's return to Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his association with Sand began in earnest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years older was George Sand compared to Frédéric?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What adjective is used to describe Frédéric and Sand's time together during the winter of 1838?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">miserable</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Frédéric and Sand venture to after Majorca became unlivable when it was discovered they were not married?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Valldemossa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With whom did Chopin go to London with in 1837?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Camille Pleyel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was James Broadwood's occupation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">piano maker</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much older was George Sands than Chopin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During Sands and Chopin's visit to Majorca who were they fleeing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Félicien Mallefille</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After it became known that Sands and Chopin were unmarried where did they end up taking up shelter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a former Carthusian monastery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chopin and Sand become lovers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 1838</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Chopin and Sand go between November 1838 and February 1839?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Majorca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who joined Chopin and Sand on their trip to Majorca?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sand's two children</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">One of the reasons Chopin and Sand went to Majorca was to escape the threats of who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Félicien Mallefille.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Chopin and Sand stay in Valldemossa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a former Carthusian monastery</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 3 December, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in Majorca: &quot;Three doctors have visited me ...

Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain. As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her &quot;third child&quot;. In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a &quot;child,&quot; a &quot;little angel&quot;, a &quot;sufferer&quot; and a &quot;beloved little corpse.&quot; In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer's galleys. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made &quot;a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship.&quot; The two would never meet again.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Sand's daughter's fiance that contributed to deteriorating the relationship between Sand and Chopin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Auguste Clésinger</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the interest Sand had that Chopin showed apathy towards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">radical political pursuits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Sand begin referring to Chopin as as his illness got worse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">third child</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Sand's novel she published in reference to her situation with Chopin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lucrezia Floriani</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Chopin and Sand ultimately bring their relationship to a close?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1847</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chopin's relationship with Sand start to deteriorate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1846</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whom did Sand's daughter Solange become engaged to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Auguste Clésinger</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What novel did Sand write in 1847?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lucrezia Floriani</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the fortune hunter engaged to Sand's daughter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Auguste Clésinger.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What role did Sand take on as her relationship with Chopin progressed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nurse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Sand's book where the main characters can be interpreted as Sand and Chopin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lucrezia Floriani</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Chopin end his relationship with Sand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1847</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chopin's output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year.

At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Chopin stay while in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dover Street</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company provided Chopin with a piano while in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Broadwood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Chopin's initial performance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stafford House</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two notable guests were present during his premiere performance at Stafford House?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date did he perform with Viardot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7 July</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What steet did Chopin stay on in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dover Street</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Broadway provide for Chopin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a grand piano.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two dignitaries where at his first performance in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to hearing him play, what else did people seek from Chopin in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">piano lessons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sang chopin arrangements on July 7 of the year Chopin was in London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Viardot</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family.

The Op. 58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex counterpoint, &quot;worthy of Brahms&quot; according to the music historians Kornel Michałowski and Jim Samson.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many movements are No. 2, Op. 35 and No. 3, Op 58 in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two people claimed that Op 58 was &quot;worthy of Brahms&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kornel Michałowski and Jim Samson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many movements are in No. 2, Op. 35 and No. 3, Op 58?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which movement was found lacking in musicality by Schumann?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The last movement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to music historians, which sonata is similar to German tradition and worthy of Brahms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Op. 58</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Chopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique.

In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.&quot; Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: &quot;Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.&quot; He further stated: &quot;One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.&quot; The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Chopin's style based upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">independent finger technique</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote about a Chopin 1841 recital?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Léon Escudier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What writing of Chopin talks about everything about piano playing has to do with proper fingering?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his Projet de méthode</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as Moritz Moszkowski, but, in the opinion of J.
