The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. Instead, a capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a capacitor originally known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a condenser</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many electrical conductors, or plates, do all capacitors contain at a minimum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two electrical conductors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the insulator in all capacitors that can store energy by becoming polarized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a dielectric</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what form does a capacitor store energy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the form of an electrostatic field</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the energy stored by a capacitor located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between its plates</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When there is a potential difference across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge +Q to collect on one plate and negative charge −Q to collect on the other plate.

A capacitor is assumed to be self-contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field. The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field.

The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What order is the breakdown field strength for air dielectric capacitors of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">of the order 2 to 5 MV/m</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what order is the breakdown field strength for mica dielectric capacitors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100 to 300 MV/m</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what way is the dielectric used in order to cause the absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors to be limited?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The dielectric is used in very thin layers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one factor that critically affects the breakdown voltage of the capacitor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the difference in the physical attributes of the dielectric used in high voltage capacitors compared to low voltage capacitors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the dielectric must be thicker</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ripple current is the AC component of an applied source (often a switched-mode power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying.

This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits. The level of absorption depends on many factors, from design considerations to charging time, since the absorption is a time-dependent process. However, the primary factor is the type of dielectric material. Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption, while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption. In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist, such as in flashtubes, television sets, and defibrillators, the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged. Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous, while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal.

Poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte, which is harmful to printed circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures, which increases equivalent series resistance. While widely used for power-supply conditioning, poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications. Electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period (around a year), and when full power is applied may short circuit, permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes (for instance, in older equipment, arcing in rectifier tubes). They can be restored before use (and damage) by gradually applying the operating voltage, often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply AC power. Unfortunately, the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits.

To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What order of magnitude of capacitance is suitable for capacitors comprised of ceramic disks with metallic coatings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">microfarads and less</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are larger value capacitors often constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">multiple stacks of plates and disks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do larger value capacitors often use as the dielectric medium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">impregnated paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are the plates and dielectrics often staggered in larger value capacitors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">To reduce the series resistance and inductance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are the conductive plates often made for larger value capacitors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Capacitors may have their connecting leads arranged in many configurations, for example axially or radially. &quot;Axial&quot; means that the leads are on a common axis, typically the axis of the capacitor's cylindrical body – the leads extend from opposite ends.

If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI.

When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle with respect to the primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted to the side of the motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque.
