It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar (Metropolitan City), as compared to Upa-Mahanagar (Sub-Metropolitan City) or Nagar (City). Kathmandu is the core of Nepal's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu Valley consisting of Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Madhyapur Thimi, Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities. Kathmandu is also known informally as &quot;KTM&quot; or the &quot;tri-city&quot;.

The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber. During the Kirata era, a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu. In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages, Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan.

From Sankhu, they migrated to Yambu and Yengal (Lanjagwal and Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu. This created the basis of Newar Buddhism, which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world.

The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa, the sword of Manjushri. The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas. One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali (in front of Singha Durbar). The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet, leading to tremendous growth in architecture. Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era. For example, the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan, the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma. The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well. The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era, both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas. Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia, creating religious art for their neighbors. For example, Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China. Bhrikuti, the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo, was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Kathmandu resulted from the merger of what two settlements?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dakshin Koligram</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Kathmandu's historical founder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gunakamadeva</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Chandrahrasa belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Manjushri</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many barracks guarded ancient Kathmandu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Trade between what two countries typically went through ancient Kathmandu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India and Tibet</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era. Rulers from Tirhut, upon being attacked by Muslims, fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu's population, including the king Abhaya Malla. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between India and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruled Nepal after the Licchavi?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Malla</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Khas, who attacked Nepal in the early Malla period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turk Muslims</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What fraction of Kathmandu's population died in an ancient earthquake?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Mangriha, what Licchavi-era building was destroyed in an ancient earthquake?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kailashkut Bhawan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What notable Nepali figure died in a Kathmandu earthquake?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abhaya Malla</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur.

The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of water spouts, the institutionalization of trusts (called guthis), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla. Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g. Haramekhala), religion (e.g. Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the former durbar of Kirtipur, Nyatapola, Kumbheshwar, the Krishna temple, and others.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many cities were present in the Kathmandu Valley in the late Malla period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the waning years of the Malla dynasty, what fortified cities existed in the Kathmandu Valley?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cultures influenced Nepal in the later Malla era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a book of medicine from the Malla period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Haramekhala</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does Amarkosh date to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1381</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768.

Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture, such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur, were built during this era. However, trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations.

Kathmandu's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia.

In 1956, air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway, between Kathmandu and Raxaul (at India's border), was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity; some of these include the Tourism Development Board, the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity.

Since then, tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8% of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining[why?].

In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous. Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju (the Nepali name for Durga) until she menstruates, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status. The current Royal Kumari, Matina Shakya, age four, was installed in October 2008 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Durga called in Nepali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taleju</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is Kumari believed to incarnate Taleju?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">until she menstruates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Royal Kumari as of late 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Matina Shakya</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of government did Nepal have after the monarchy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maoist</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva (Pashupati). Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu, Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu. It served as the seat of national deity, Lord Pashupatinath, until Nepal was secularized. However, a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior. The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century, although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old. The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shivaratri, or the night of Lord Shiva, is the most important festival that takes place here, attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Pashupatinath Temple built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What faith does the Pashupatinath Temple serve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hindu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Pashupati?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lord Shiva</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prior to the secularization of Nepal, who was the country's national god?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lord Pashupatinath</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who damaged the Pashupatinath Temple in the 14th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mughal invaders</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Believers in Pashupatinath (mainly Hindus) are allowed to enter the temple premises, but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River.

At present, about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, to cities such as Istanbul, Delhi, Kolkata, Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Dhaka, Islamabad, Paro, Lhasa, Chengdu, and Guangzhou. A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly. Since 2013, Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu. Regionally, several Nepali airlines operate from the city, including Agni Air, Buddha Air, Cosmic Air, Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines, to other major towns across Nepal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Nepal's primary airport for international travel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tribhuvan International Airport</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Starting in the center of Kathmandu, how many kilometers must one travel to reach Tribhuvan International Airport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many airlines use Tribhuvan International for international flights?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what city does Arkefly offer nonstop flights to Kathmandu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amsterdam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who operates flights between Kathmandu and Istanbul?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turkish Airlines</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat (IRC).
