Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. Prior to China's adoption of communism, State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What specifically dates back with Confucius in the 6th century BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinese political philosophy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Chinese political philosophy dates back to what century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6th century BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the social and political breakdown of the country</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mohism</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of ancient Greece, where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato. Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into four categories: timocracy, tyranny, democracy and oligarchy. One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's Republic, which was followed by Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics and Politics.

A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderatation of the Stoicism and theory of justice of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying mercy as a moral example. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the City of God (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man (Civitas Terrena). Augustine's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on Earth.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who heavily influenced the early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Plato</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a key change brought about by Christian thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the moderatation of the Stoicism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who also preached that one was not a member of his or her city?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Augustine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Civitas terrena mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">City of Man</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Civitas Dei mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">City of God</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The rise of Islam, based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was &quot;political&quot; as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the &quot;rationalist&quot; Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more Hellenic view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. By the late ancient period, however, the &quot;traditionalist&quot; Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The rise of Islam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Early Islamic philosophy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who challenged the early Islamic philosophy's views?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;rationalist&quot; Mutazilite philosophers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of views did the &quot;rationalist&quot; Mutaziite philosophers hold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hellenic view</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e., the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Abunaser), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), sultan, ummah, cemaa (obligation)-and even the &quot;core&quot; terms of the Qur'an—i.e., ibadah (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and ilah (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The clashes between Ehl-i Sunna and Shia had what kind of character? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">political</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Islamic political philosophy was rooted in what sources? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is taken as the basis of an analysis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The political conceptions of Islam</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Medieval political philosophy in Europe was heavily influenced by Christian thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazalite Islamic thinking in that the Roman Catholics though subordinating philosophy to theology did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation. Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. Thomas Aquinas who helped reintroduce Aristotle's works, which had only been transmitted to Catholic Europe through Muslim Spain, along with the commentaries of Averroes. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for scholastic political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the Renaissance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was heavily influenced by Christian thinking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Medieval political philosophy in Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Medieval political philosophy had much in common with what type of thinking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mutazalite Islamic thinking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. Thomas Aquinas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince, written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as The Discourses, a rigorous analysis of the classical period, did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence. Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. Thomas Hobbes, well known for his theory of the social contract, goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the most influential works during the period? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Niccolo Machiavelli's The Prince published? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1532</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote The  Prince?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Niccolò Machiavelli</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was well known for his theory of the social contract?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Hobbes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of &quot;state&quot; and &quot;government.&quot; It was decided that &quot;state&quot; would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term &quot;government&quot; would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">state</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What refers to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the physical world</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade, and Roman Catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by Protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state, which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region.

Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for the work Two Treatises of Government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Locke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Locke refuted whose political theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Robert Filmer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Locke, an absolute ruler is proposed by Hobbes is what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unnecessary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Marxist critique of capitalism — developed with Friedrich Engels — was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the Twentieth Century. The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought. Urbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the socialist movement began to form. In the mid-19th century, Marxism was developed, and socialism in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel Castro. Though Hegel's philosophy of history is similar to Immanuel Kant's, and Karl Marx's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was &quot;standing on its head&quot;, &quot;the right side up again&quot;. Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism, Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of Spirit. By the late 19th century, socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of anarchism, with thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Peter Kropotkin, and syndicalism also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, anti-imperialism and pluralism began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who developed the Marxist critique of capitalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Friedrich Engels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the defining ideological movements of the Twentieth Century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Marxist critique of capitalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What produced a parallel revolution in political thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The industrial revolution</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>World War I was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics.

In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with Marxism dominating the field. This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser, and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the New Left. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek, Leo Strauss, Isaiah Berlin, Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who published A Theory of Justice? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Rawls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Rawls publish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Theory of Justice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What continent saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The events of May 1968 led to an increased interest in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">revolutionary ideology</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Communism remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Colonialism and racism were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a pragmatic approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as rational choice theory) to political issues. The rise of feminism, LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, postcolonial, and multicultural thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the social contract by philosophers Charles W. Mills in his book The Racial Contract and Carole Patemen in her book The Sexual Contract that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What remained an important focus during the 1950s and 1960s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Communism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">There was a marked trend towards what type of approach to political issues?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pragmatic approach</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote The Racial Contract?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles W.

Rawls used a thought experiment, the original position, in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. Robert Nozick's 1974 book Anarchy, State, and Utopia, which won a National Book Award, responded to Rawls from a libertarian perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John Rawsl publish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Theory of Justice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who Published A Theory of Justice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Rawls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was A Theory of Justice published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Anarchy, State, and Utopia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Robert Nozick</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the Frankfurt School, thinkers like Herbert Marcuse, Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Jürgen Habermas combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a &quot;return to Hegel&quot;. Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Claude Lefort, and Jean Baudrillard. The Situationists were more influenced by Hegel; Guy Debord, in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Herbert Marcuse was from what school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frankfurt School,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Thinkers out of the Frankfurt School combined Marxian and what other perspective?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Freudian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who in particular moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guy Debord</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by Michael Walzer, Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor.

The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from Isaiah Berlin's positive and negative forms of liberty, namely &quot;liberty as non-domination.&quot; Unlike liberals who understand liberty as &quot;non-interference,&quot; &quot;non-domination&quot; entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of anyother person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian Quentin Skinner, jurist Cass Sunstein, and political philosopher Philip Pettit. The capability approach, pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen and further developed by legal scholar Martha Nussbaum, understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did republicanism and the capability approach arise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the end of the 20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from Isaiah Berlin's positive and negative forms of liberty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The resurgent republican movement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen pioneered what approach?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The capability approach</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
