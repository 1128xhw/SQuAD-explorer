Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do idealist philosophies say is constructed in our minds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of things are idealist philosophies skeptical about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mind-independent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with physicalist theories, what theories is idealism in conflict with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dualist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In sociology, what sorts of ideas does idealism focus on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">beliefs and values</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece. The Hindu idealists in India and the Greek Neoplatonists gave panentheistic arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality. In contrast, the Yogācāra school, which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE, based its &quot;mind-only&quot; idealism to a greater extent on phenomenological analyses of personal experience. This turn toward the subjective anticipated empiricists such as George Berkeley, who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against materialism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Indian thinkers were early idealists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hindu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Greek philosophers had idealistic views?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neoplatonists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what sect of Buddhism was the Yogācāra school affiliated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mahayana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the Yogācāra school arise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century did George Berkeley live in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beginning with Immanuel Kant, German idealists such as G.

It comes via idea from the Greek idein (ἰδεῖν), meaning &quot;to see&quot;. The term entered the English language by 1743. In ordinary use, as when speaking of Woodrow Wilson's political idealism, it generally suggests the priority of ideals, principles, values, and goals over concrete realities. Idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be, unlike pragmatists, who focus on the world as it presently is. In the arts, similarly, idealism affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty, a standard of perfection, juxtaposed to aesthetic naturalism and realism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does ἰδεῖν mean in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to see</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year was &quot;idealism&quot; a word in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1743</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose worldview contrasts with that of idealists in the ordinary sense of the word?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pragmatists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language is ἰδεῖν?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Any philosophy that assigns crucial importance to the ideal or spiritual realm in its account of human existence may be termed &quot;idealist&quot;. Metaphysical idealism is an ontological doctrine that holds that reality itself is incorporeal or experiential at its core. Beyond this, idealists disagree on which aspects of the mental are more basic. Platonic idealism affirms that abstractions are more basic to reality than the things we perceive, while subjective idealists and phenomenalists tend to privilege sensory experience over abstract reasoning. Epistemological idealism is the view that reality can only be known through ideas, that only psychological experience can be apprehended by the mind.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term used for philosophies that consider the spiritual to be of paramount importance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">idealist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of idealism believes that reality is fundamentally nonphysical?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Metaphysical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of idealism sees abstracts as more real than perceived objects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Platonic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with phenomenalists, what idealists believe the senses are more important than reason?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subjective</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of idealism believes that we can only know the real world via ideas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Epistemological</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Subjective idealists like George Berkeley are anti-realists in terms of a mind-independent world, whereas transcendental idealists like Immanuel Kant are strong skeptics of such a world, affirming epistemological and not metaphysical idealism. Thus Kant defines idealism as &quot;the assertion that we can never be certain whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining&quot;. He claimed that, according to idealism, &quot;the reality of external objects does not admit of strict proof. On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness.&quot;  However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. Objective idealists make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus Plato and Gottfried Leibniz affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness—a rejection of epistemological idealism—but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental abstract forms, while for Leibniz they were proto-mental and concrete monads.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is a notable subjective idealist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George Berkeley</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What famous philosopher was a transcendental idealist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Immanuel Kant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are subjective idealists opposed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">realists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Plato, what notable philosopher rejected epistemological idealism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gottfried Leibniz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believed the essence of reality to be composed of monads?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leibniz</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Christian theologians have held idealist views, often based on Neoplatonism, despite the influence of Aristotelian scholasticism from the 12th century onward. Later western theistic idealism such as that of Hermann Lotze offers a theory of the &quot;world ground&quot; in which all things find their unity: it has been widely accepted by Protestant theologians. Several modern religious movements, for example the organizations within the New Thought Movement and the Unity Church, may be said to have a particularly idealist orientation. The theology of Christian Science includes a form of idealism: it teaches that all that truly exists is God and God's ideas; that the world as it appears to the senses is a distortion of the underlying spiritual reality, a distortion that may be corrected (both conceptually and in terms of human experience) through a reorientation (spiritualization) of thought.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what philosophy was Christian idealism often rooted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neoplatonism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophy influential in the medieval church was opposed to Christian idealism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aristotelian scholasticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did Christian thought begin to be influenced by the scholasticism of Aristotle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Unity Church, what contemporary religious movement may be regarded as idealist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Thought</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What notable idealist was responsible for a &quot;world ground&quot; theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hermann Lotze</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Plato's theory of forms or &quot;ideas&quot; describes ideal forms (for example the platonic solids in geometry or abstracts like Goodness and Justice), as universals existing independently of any particular instance. Arne Grøn calls this doctrine &quot;the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a transcendent idealism&quot;, while Simone Klein calls Plato &quot;the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism&quot;. Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a metaphysical and epistemological dualist, an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense, although quantum physics' assertion that man's consciousness is an immutable and primary requisite for not merely perceiving but shaping matter, and thus his reality, would give more credence to Plato's dualist position.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who regarded Plato as the oldest exponent of metaphysical objective idealism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Simone Klein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of dualist is Plato regarded as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">metaphysical and epistemological</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was another term for forms in Plato's theory of forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ideas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of physics might support a worldview similar to Platonic dualism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quantum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the neoplatonist Plotinus, wrote Nathaniel Alfred Boll; &quot;there even appears, probably for the first time in Western philosophy, idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught... that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time...&quot;.

Schopenhauer emphasized that we are restricted to our own consciousness. The world that appears is only a representation or mental picture of objects. We directly and immediately know only representations. All objects that are external to the mind are known indirectly through the mediation of our mind.

For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the &quot;subject&quot; (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed &quot;object&quot; (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of &quot;subject-object identity,&quot; subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural &quot;God&quot;) as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality—and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's &quot;self-realization&quot; occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every &quot;object&quot; it observes is something &quot;alien,&quot; meaning something separate or apart from &quot;subject.&quot; In Hegel's words, &quot;The object is revealed to it [to &quot;subject&quot;] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.&quot; Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every &quot;object&quot; is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the &quot;finite&quot; (man, human) becomes the &quot;infinite&quot; (&quot;God,&quot; divine), replacing the imaginary or &quot;picture-thinking&quot; supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: &quot;Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'&quot; The picture Hegel presents is &quot;a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Hegel's thought, what inner reality is possessed by both subject and object?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spirit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for Hegel's &quot;subject&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">any human observer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Spirit turn into when a person arrives at self-realization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Absolute Spirit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Hegel mean by &quot;object&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">any external entity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Tucker argue that Hegel's philosophy involved the worship of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kierkegaard criticised Hegel's idealist philosophy in several of his works, particularly his claim to a comprehensive system that could explain the whole of reality.

Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between ontology and epistemology. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings.

We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article The Refutation of Idealism is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism esse est percipi, &quot;to be is to be perceived&quot;, finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;the sensation of yellow&quot; are identical - &quot;to be yellow&quot; is &quot;to be experienced as yellow&quot;. But it also seems there is a difference between &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;the sensation of yellow&quot; and &quot;that esse is held to be percipi, solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it&quot;. Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley.

Leibniz' form of idealism, known as Panpsychism, views &quot;monads&quot; as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are &quot;substantial forms of being&quot;,elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is substance while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony established by God, the central monad, between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian Theism. The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism.
