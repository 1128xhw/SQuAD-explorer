Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&amp;B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyonce start becoming popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the late 1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What areas did Beyonce compete in when she was growing up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">singing and dancing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyonce leave Destiny's Child and become a solo singer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city and state did Beyonce  grow up? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Houston, Texas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which decade did Beyonce become famous?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what R&amp;B group was she the lead singer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Destiny's Child</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What album made her a worldwide known artist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dangerously in Love</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who managed the Destiny's Child group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mathew Knowles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city did Beyonce grow up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Houston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Beyonce's first solo album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dangerously in Love</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was Beyonce born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 4, 1981</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Beyonce's full name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyoncé rise to fame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What role did Beyoncé have in Destiny's Child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lead singer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first album Beyoncé released as a solo artist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dangerously in Love</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyoncé release Dangerously in Love?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Grammy awards did Beyoncé win for her first solo album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Beyoncé's role in Destiny's Child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lead singer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Beyoncé's first solo album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dangerously in Love</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyoncé release her first solo album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in June 2005, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, and &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot;. Beyoncé also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;. Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth studio album, Beyoncé (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After her second solo album, what other entertainment venture did Beyonce explore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which artist did Beyonce marry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay Z</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To set the record for Grammys, how many did Beyonce win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">six</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what movie did Beyonce receive  her first Golden Globe nomination?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dreamgirls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyonce take a hiatus in her career and take control of her management?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which album was darker in tone from her previous work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beyoncé</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After what movie portraying Etta James, did Beyonce create Sasha Fierce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cadillac Records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Destiny's Child end their group act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Beyoncé's second solo album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">B'Day</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Beyoncé's first acting job, in 2006?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dreamgirls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Beyoncé married to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay Z</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Beyoncé's alter-ego?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sasha Fierce</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A self-described &quot;modern-day feminist&quot;, Beyoncé creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment.

In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir.

They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&amp;B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&amp;B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who decided to place Beyonce's group in Star Search the talent show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arne Frager</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1995, who decided to manage the girls singing group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beyoncé's father</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first record label to give the girls a record deal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elektra Records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who brought Beyonce to California and enter her group in Star Search?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arne Frager</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Beyonce's father quit his job to manage her group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1995</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What large record company recorded Beyonce's group's first album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sony Music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What record company first signed Beyonce's group and later cut them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elektra Records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what age did Beyonce meet LaTavia Robertson?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">age eight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Beyoncé when she met LaTavia Roberson?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first group Beyoncé was a part of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Girl's Tyme</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who placed Girl's Tyme in Star Search?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arne Frager</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyoncé begin to manage the girl group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1995</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who signed the girl group on October 5, 1995?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&amp;B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&amp;B/Soul Single for &quot;No, No, No&quot;. The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot;, the group's first number-one single, &quot;Jumpin' Jumpin'&quot; and &quot;Say My Name&quot;, which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. &quot;Say My Name&quot; won the Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&amp;B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song &quot;After All Is Said and Done&quot; for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which film featured Destiny's Child's first major single?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Men in Black</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which song, did Destiny's Child take home the grammy award for best R&amp;B performance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Say My Name&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Beyonce record with for the movie &quot;The Best Man?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marc Nelson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyonce's group changed their name to Destiny's Child in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Book of Isaiah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Debut song, &quot;Killing Time&quot; was featured on what movie's sound track?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Men in Black</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song won Best R&amp;B Performance in the 43 Annual Grammy Awards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Say My Name</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What singer did Beyonce record a song with for the movie, ''The Best Man&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marc Nelson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Destiny's Child get their name from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Book of Isaiah.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Destiny's Child song, Killing Time, was included in which film's soundtrack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Men in Black.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Destiny's Child's first major song hit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">No, No, No</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Destiny's Child release their second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1999</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Beyoncé sing a duet with for &quot;The Best Man&quot; film?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marc Nelson</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause. Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time. The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously. Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it. Franklin was dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mental health issue did Beyonce go through?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">depression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event occured after she was publicly criticized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">boyfriend left her</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who supported Beyonce through her depression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event caused Beyonce's depression?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">split with Luckett and Rober</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was Beyonce depressed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a couple of years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who helped Beyonce fight her depression the most?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced Luckett and Roberson in Destiny's Child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was blamed for Luckett and Roberson leaving Destiny's Child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beyoncé</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who helped Beyoncé overcome her depression during the years following the Destiny's Child split?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which newest member was removed from Destiny's Child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Farrah Franklin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The remaining band members recorded &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels.

In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.

The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and the title track, &quot;Survivor&quot;, the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; and the top-five songs &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; and &quot;Halo&quot;. Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, &quot;Halo&quot;'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, and singles &quot;Diva&quot;, &quot;Ego&quot;, &quot;Broken-Hearted Girl&quot; and &quot;Video Phone&quot;. The music video for &quot;Single Ladies&quot; has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the &quot;first major dance craze&quot; of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's &quot;You Belong with Me&quot;, led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am... World Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing $119.5 million.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyonce got married in 2008 to whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay Z</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Her third album, &quot;I am...Sasha Fierce&quot; was released when?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 18, 2008</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which decade, did Beyonce have more top ten songs than any other woman?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which singer beat out Beyonce for best video performance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taylor Swift</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2009, Beyonce started her second world tour and grossed how much money?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">119.5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did she reveal the marriage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in a video montage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyonce begin her second world tour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who beat out Beyonce for Best Female Video ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taylor Swift</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the second world tour make in dollars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">119.5 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyoncé get married?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 4, 2008</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Beyoncé marry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay Z.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Beyoncé's alter ego?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sasha Fierce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The video for what song won Beyoncé the 2009 MTV Video of the Year award?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Single Ladies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which prominent star felt the 2009 Female Video of the Year award should have went to Beyoncé instead of Taylor Swift?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kanye West</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beyoncé further expanded her acting career, starring as blues singer Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records.

Beyoncé donated her entire salary from the film to Phoenix House, an organization of rehabilitation centers for heroin addicts around the country. On January 20, 2009, Beyoncé performed James' &quot;At Last&quot; at the First Couple's first inaugural ball. Beyoncé starred opposite Ali Larter and Idris Elba in the thriller, Obsessed.

The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&amp;B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as &quot;bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood&quot;. The single &quot;Drunk in Love&quot;, featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple's first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for &quot;Pretty Hurts&quot;, as well as best collaboration for &quot;Drunk in Love&quot;. In November, Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013. Beyoncé was reissued with new material in three forms: as an extended play, a box set, as well as a full platinum edition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Beyonce release her 5th album to a huge surprise?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the iTunes Store</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyonce get her fifth consecutive number one hit album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 13, 2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the album released? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the iTunes Store</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who joined Beyonce on her On The Run Tour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay Z</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who reported Beyonce to e the top earning woman in music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Forbes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much more were her earnings that the year before?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than double her earnings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyoncé release her fifth studio album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">December 13, 2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many digital copies of her fifth album did Beyoncé sell in six days?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song on Beyoncé's fifth studio album featured her husband?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Drunk in Love</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the tour featuring both Beyoncé and Jay Z?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">On the Run Tour.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015, Beyoncé was nominated for six awards, ultimately winning three: Best R&amp;B Performance and Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;Drunk in Love&quot;, and Best Surround Sound Album for Beyoncé.

Beyoncé appeared as Jay Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, which would further fuel speculation of their relationship. On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay Z were married without publicity. As of April 2014, the couple have sold a combined 300 million records together. The couple are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years. Beyoncé suffered a miscarriage in 2010 or 2011, describing it as &quot;the saddest thing&quot; she had ever endured. She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss.

They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the &quot;Most Powerful Women in the World&quot; list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the &quot;Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30&quot; list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyoncé and Jay Z placed at number one on the &quot;World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples&quot;, for collectively earning $78 million. The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the &quot;highest-earning power couple&quot; for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyoncé's endorsements of Pepsi and H&amp;M made her and Jay Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry. That year, Beyoncé was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings. MTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history; she succeeded to do so in April 2014. In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at #1 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date. As of May 2015, her net worth is estimated to be $250 million.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyonce beat out which musical artists for most paid between June 2007 and June 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna and Celine Dion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyonce and Jay Z got a Guinness World record for what in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">highest-earning power couple</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyonce became the highest-paid black musician in which year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Up until May of 2015, how much is Beyonce's total worth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">250 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Between 2008 and 2009, which entertainers did Beyonce beat in earnings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madonna and Celine Dion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2012 who placed Beyonce at 16 in the Celebrity List?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Forbes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did she and Jay Z become the highest paid black celebrity couple?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did she earn in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">115 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Beyonce's net worth in 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">250 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who began reporting Beyoncé's annual earnings, starting in 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Forbes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Beyoncé become the highest paid black musician, ever?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 2014.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who predicted that Beyoncé would become the highest paid black entertainer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">MTV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Jay Z and Beyoncé become the first music couple worth over a billion dollars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beyoncé's vocal range spans four octaves.

Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.

Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.

Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song &quot;I Was Here&quot; and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci &quot;Chime for Change&quot; campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was &quot;finding the best qualities in every human being.&quot; With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyoncé is also taking part in &quot;Miss a Meal&quot;, a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which national event caused Beyonce to produce &quot;Demand a Plan?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song did Beyonce contribute to the campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">I Was Here</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyonce is contributing to which food-donation campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Miss a Meal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On June 1 , 2013 where was the concert held for &quot;a Chime for Change&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Beyonce was speaking about whom when she said her gift was &quot;finding the best qualities in every human being.&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">her mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Demand a Plan video campaign followed what tragic event?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the focus of the Gucci Chime for Change campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spread female empowerment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What crowdfunding platform was used in the concert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catapult</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the campaign that Beyoncé and others are involved in that deals with gun control?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Demand A Plan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What school shooting prompted the creation of Demand A Plan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sandy Hook Elementary School</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song did Beyoncé donate to the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">I Was Here</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Beyoncé work with in 2013 on the Chime for Change campaign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
