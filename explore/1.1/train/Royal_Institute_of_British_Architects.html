By the 1970s another issue had emerged affecting education for qualification and registration for practice as an architect, due to the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with European Union Directives concerning mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the policy for a single market of the European Union. This led to proposals for reconstituting ARCUK. Eventually, in the 1990s, before proceeding, the government issued a consultation paper &quot;Reform of Architects Registration&quot; (1994). The change of name to &quot;Architects Registration Board&quot; was one of the proposals which was later enacted in the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and reenacted as the Architects Act 1997; another was the abolition of the ARCUK Board of Architectural Education.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization's policies regarding acceptance of professional qualifications prompted thoughts of revamping ARCUK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the name of ARCUK change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the legistlation leading to the change in ARCUK's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was shut down as a result of legislation changing the name of ARCUK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ARCUK Board of Architectural Education</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the new name given to ARCUK in the '90s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Architects Registration Board</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>RIBA Visiting Boards continue to assess courses for exemption from the RIBA's examinations in architecture.
