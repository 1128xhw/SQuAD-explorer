A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process of making beer called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">brewing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a building called that is used for making beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a brewery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is company that makes beer typically known as? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a brewing company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is beer classified as when it is made for non-commerical consumption? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">homebrewing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was home brewing first allowed in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1963</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation.

This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used.

The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a brewery called that makes a small amount of beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">microbrewery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would you call a microbrewery that also has a restaurant or a pub?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">brewpub</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In general, how much beer can a microbrewery make and still be classified as a microbrewery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">around 15,000 barrels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city is home to the oldest known brewery in the world that is still active?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Freising</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery first licensed as a brewery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1040</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily &quot;light&quot; beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main source of the alcohol in beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sugars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the process during brewing in which sugar is metabolized into alcohol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fermentation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what concentration can yeast no longer survive in alcohol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">above 12%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could decrease alcohol content during the brewing process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Low temperatures</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why would more fermentable sugars be added to be beer during the brewing process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to increase alcohol content</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed &quot;real ale&quot; by the CAMRA organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a &quot;stillage&quot; which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between 11–13 °C or 52–55 °F), before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to &quot;drop&quot; (clear) again, as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being &quot;gravity-fed&quot; directly into the glass.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would you call a frame that holds the cask of beer horizontally when it arrives at the pub?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stillage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What temperature are cask ales stored at before being tapped?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">52–55 °F</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would you call a beer that has not been filtered or pasteurized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cask-conditioned ales</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long does it take for sediment to settle and clear after a cask ale has been tapped?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">from several hours to several days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What tool is used to pull beer from a cask to serve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a hand pump</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beer contains ethyl alcohol, the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of alcohol is found in beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ethyl alcohol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is alcohol measured in the human body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blood alcohol concentration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of alcohol is found in wine and distilled spirits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ethyl alcohol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when someone dies from inhaling vomit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pulmonary aspiration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What could be caused by a 0.80% Blood alcohol content in a human?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fatal alcohol poisoning</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beer is sold in bottles and cans; it may also be available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars.

The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes fermentation during the brewing process when making a beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">yeast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which ingredient gives beer its flavor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What vegetable is sometimes used as a grain source for beer in Brazil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">potato</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a popular grain source for brewing beer in Mexico?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">agave</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In a recipe, what would you call the list of each source of starch in beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the grain bill</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were hops first known to be used in beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">822 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name was Adalhard the Elder also known as in 822 AD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Adalard of Corbie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which century were hops first widely cultivated for making beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the thirteenth century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which century did hops become the most popular flavoring for beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the sixteenth century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would you call a mixture of ingredients used for brewing before the 16th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gruit</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast.

Cans protect the beer from light (thereby preventing &quot;skunked&quot; beer) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles. Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer, then became commonly associated with less expensive, mass-produced beers, even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles.

The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and &quot;The Hymn to Ninkasi&quot;, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is most popular alcoholic drink in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is believed to be the oldest alcoholic drinking the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term used to describe the making beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">brewing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What brewing process naturally carbonates beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fermentation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What prayer did people use in Mesopotamia to remember a beer recipe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Hymn to Ninkasi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beer was spread through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes as far back as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale. The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs. What they did not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year were hops first believed to be added to beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">822</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what continent were hops first added to beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a Carolingian Abbot credited for adding to beer in 822?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was believed to have added hops to beer in 1067?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abbess Hildegard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Abbess Hildegard live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bingen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The word ale comes from Old English ealu (plural ealoþ), in turn from Proto-Germanic *alu (plural *aluþ), ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European base *h₂elut-, which holds connotations of &quot;sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication&quot;.

Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. Samuel Adams reached 20% abv with Millennium, and then surpassed that amount to 25.6% abv with Utopias. The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz's Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23% abv beer. In September 2011, the Scottish brewery BrewDog produced Ghost Deer, which, at 28%, they claim to be the world's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much alcohol is contained in the beer Vetter 33?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10.5%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the strongest beer in 1994 according to the Guinness Book of World Records?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vetter 33</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What brewing company produced the beer Millennium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Samuel Adams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the brewing company BrewDog start producing a beer called Ghost Deer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do brewing companies sometimes use to give more alcohol content to their beer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">champagne yeasts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Draught beer's environmental impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, shows that the CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer is estimated to be 2.5 square meters (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions.
