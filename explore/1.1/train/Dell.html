After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. In 2014 it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP. Dell is currently the #1 shipper of PC monitors in the world. Dell is the sixth largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortune magazine. It is the second largest non-oil company in Texas – behind AT&amp;T – and the largest company in the Greater Austin area. It was a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&amp;P 500, until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on October 30, 2013.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What number was dell on the Fortune 500 list until 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">51</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Dell go private?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dell is currently the #1 shipper of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PC monitors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which state is Dell the sixth largest company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Texas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What PC vendor rank did Dell hold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">third largest</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company’s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What market did Dell ignore at first?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">consumer market</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Dell's internet site gain popularity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was happening to Dell's average sale to individuals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">going up</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Dell create their internal marketing group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1997</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model. Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years, yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell's rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players.

Dell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, for instance Lenovo's ThinkPad series was winning corporate customers away from Dell's laptops, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping. Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45 percent, seven percent at Hewlett Packard, six percent at Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What industry was getting smaller?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Dell fall behind Lenovo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other American company fell behind Lenovo with Dell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hewlett Packard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What PC was taking corporate customers from Dell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ThinkPad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company was Dell behind in profits in 2012?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apple Inc.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including &quot;burn-in&quot;), and quality control.

Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with Harris Technology (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for &quot;Slashing Prices&quot;. Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including Studio and XPS systems in late 2008. Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks — owned by Coles Group — reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of Inspiron and Studio notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range.

The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted. It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD. In 2010 Dell finally paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud.

The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade did Dell begin to sell things other than PCs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq were the major providers of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">servers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What servers did Dell create that they tried to break into the market with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PowerEdge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Dell's enterprise revenue make up a large chunk of its profit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1998</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which company did Dell exceed as a server provider?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Compaq</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs, but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation. Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers (a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory). As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores. CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What market made up the majority of Dell's sales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">PC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What advantage did Dell hold in the PC market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">price</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What operation did Hewlett Packard and Acer make more efficient to compete with Dell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">manufacturing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Dell miss out on sales due to relying on the internet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">big box stores</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company stated that Dell was preventing itself from innovating?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CNET</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the late 2000s, Dell's &quot;configure to order&quot; approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.

The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010. Dell's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to Herbalife. Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.

It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then. EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual &quot;Federation&quot; structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core &quot;EMC II&quot; data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9bn from servers, while EMC had $16.5bn from EMC II, $1bn from RSA Security, $6bn from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software. EMC owns around 80 percent of the stock of VMware. The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell.

U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft's Windows Vista (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008. Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country's PC market was Dell reliant on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Dell's profits were desktop PCs being sold to commercial and corporate buyers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">32 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year were Dell's PC profits shrinking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What operating system was slated to be the next system upgrade for corporate clients?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Microsoft's Windows Vista</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs. Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android. The Dell Streak was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen. InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers. Dell has responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets. The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to an operating loss in Q3 2012. In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which division of Dell were unsuccessful in developing mobile devices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mobility</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The release of what electronic had a negative impact on Dell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iPad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Dell product was a commercial failure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Streak</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What line of high end electronics did Dell create that failed to compete with Apple products?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">XPS</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Dell see its first decline in holiday sales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2012</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dell's reputation for poor customer service, since 2002, which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web. The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same lineup sold for hundreds. Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting &quot;got in the way,&quot; aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional &quot;bloatware&quot; on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the &quot;Dell Hell&quot; prominent on Internet search engines.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Dell have a poor reputation for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">customer service</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Dell move its call centers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">offshore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Dell employee was moved from head of manufacturing to head of customer service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dick Hunter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much had Dell spent by 2006 on improving customer service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$100 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn expressed interest in purchasing Dell.

As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Dell lose its tech lead to Hewlett-Packard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was HP's growth during the third quarter of 2006?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the rate of decline that Dell experienced in PC shipments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8.9%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Dell's market share at the end of 2006?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13.9%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dell was the first company to publicly state a timeline for the elimination of toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which it planned to phase out by the end of 2009. It revised this commitment and now aims to remove these toxics by the end of 2011 but only in its computing products. In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’. Dell has launched its first products completely free of PVC and BFRs with the G-Series monitors (G2210 and G2410) in 2009.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What toxic chemical did Dell set to eliminate from its products?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polyvinyl chloride</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year does Dell plan to remove chemicals from its computers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2011</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What activists protested at Dell's offices in response to the usage of toxic chemicals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greenpeace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Dell launch its first products that were free of toxic chemicals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service.
