Its compounds are commonly encountered as copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as azurite, malachite and turquoise and have been widely used historically as pigments. Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris (or patina). Decorative art prominently features copper, both by itself and in the form of pigments.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was copper mostly mined at in the Roman era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cyprus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term does the name copper originate from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">сuprum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What componds are common in copper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">copper(II) salts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one color common in copper salts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the color pigment on building structures that are made using copper.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">green verdigris</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was copper first known to have been used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">9000 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what area is the first recorded use of copper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle East</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was copper thought to have been discovered in China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2800 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Copper smelting resulted in the development of what other metal smelting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron smelting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Natural bronze start to be used by the general public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5500 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze made by depletion gilding.

Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry. This includes building wire, communications cable, power distribution cable, appliance wire, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used to manufacture electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, solderability, and ease of installation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What metal is used most often in electrical wiring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">copper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most important market for copper today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Electrical wiring</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of mined copper is used for cables and electrical wiring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roughly half</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What metal are most overhead electrical wires made out of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aluminium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one property of copper that makes it so useful in electrical wiring?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high electrical conductivity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Copper is biostatic, meaning bacteria will not grow on it.

The filled d-shells in these elements do not contribute much to the interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group of the periodic table is copper in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">group 11</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name a property that copper, silver and gold have in common.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one s-orbital electron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes copper bondings weaker than other metals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">filled d-electron shell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is copper normally supplied?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fine-grained polycrystalline form</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a weaker form of copper than fine-grained polycrystalline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">monocrystalline forms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Copper is synthesized in massive stars and is present in the Earth's crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million (ppm), where it occurs as native copper or in minerals such as the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite, the copper carbonates azurite and malachite, and the copper(I) oxide mineral cuprite.

These can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products; as such, they are important in the field of organic synthesis. Copper(I) acetylide is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling and the Sonogashira coupling.

As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast (around 1014 tons just in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, or about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction). However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable, given present-day prices and technologies. Various estimates of existing copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long has copper been in use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at least 10,000 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of copper has been extracted since 1900?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">95%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of mined cooper has been extracted in the last 24 years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than half</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much copper is estimated to exsist on earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1014 tons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a major source of cooper in modern times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Recycling</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency.

It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What started about 4000 years after copper smelting was discovered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alloying copper with tin to make bronze</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the first datings of Bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4500 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3700–3300 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the transition between the Neolithic period and the bronze age called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chalcolithic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an alloy of copper and zinc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brass</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals, but not some microorganisms. The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass. Stated differently, the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0.97 mg/day and as 3.0 mg/day. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the level of copper in the human body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is copper absorbed in humans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the gut</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is copper bound with when it is sent to the liver?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">albumin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What protein carries the majority of copper in blood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ceruloplasmin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can the body get rid of excess copper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">via bile</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and to a lesser extent chalcocite (Cu2S). These minerals are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10–15% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching. Heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into its oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag, which floats on top of the heated mass. The resulting copper matte consisting of Cu2S is then roasted to convert all sulfides into oxides:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average concentration of copper in ores?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">0.6%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are most commercial ores?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sulfides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens to the silicate slag  during the flash smelting process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">floats on top</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does heating copper ore materials with silica remove?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the sulfides convert to after the copper matte is roasted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oxides</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Together with caesium and gold (both yellow), and osmium (bluish), copper is one of only four elemental metals with a natural color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells is such that it corresponds to orange light. The same mechanism accounts for the yellow color of gold and caesium.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many metals have a natural color that isn't gray?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What color is pure copper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">orange-red</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does copper aquire when exposed to air?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reddish tarnish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The energy difference between filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells corresponds to what color of light?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">orange light</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What color is the metal caesium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">yellow</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Copper has been used since ancient times as a durable, corrosion resistant, and weatherproof architectural material.
