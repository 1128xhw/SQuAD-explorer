According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Zähringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna &quot;cleft&quot;. The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the founder of the city of Bern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Berchtold V, Duke of Zähringen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal does legend say Bern is named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a bear</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the earliest reference to keeping live bears in the Bärengraben?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1440s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the common assumption of what Bern was named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna &quot;cleft&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Finding what in the 1980s changed the assumption as to what the city was named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Bern zinc tablet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal is on the seal and coat of arms of Bern?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bear</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What live animals did they keep in the Bärengraben?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bears</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the earliest that they kept live bears in the Bärengraben?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1440s.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today′s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far.
