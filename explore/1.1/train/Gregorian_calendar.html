Because the celebration of Easter was tied to the spring equinox, the Roman Catholic Church considered the steady drift in the date of Easter caused by the year being slightly too long to be undesirable. The reform was adopted initially by the Catholic countries of Europe. Protestants and Eastern Orthodox countries continued to use the traditional Julian calendar and adopted the Gregorian reform after a time, for the sake of convenience in international trade.

In the Julian calendar, this leap day was inserted by doubling 24 February, and the Gregorian reform did not change the date of the leap day.

Firstly, he proposed a correction to the length of the year. The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Lilius first propose to correct in the calendar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">length of the year</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By how much is the Julian calendar too long?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11 minutes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much difference does the extra 11 minutes make over 400 years time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three days</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was the original vernal equinox set?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21 March</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By the time of Lilius where was the equinox falling?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 or 11 March</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most Western European countries changed the start of the year to 1 January before they adopted the Gregorian calendar.

The canonical Easter tables were devised at the end of the third century, when the vernal equinox fell either on 20 March or 21 March depending on the year's position in the leap year cycle. As the rule was that the full moon preceding Easter was not to precede the equinox the equinox was fixed at 21 March for computational purposes and the earliest date for Easter was fixed at 22 March.

This would allow for a more consistent and accurate scheduling of the feast of Easter. In 1577, a Compendium was sent to expert mathematicians outside the reform commission for comments. Some of these experts, including Giambattista Benedetti and Giuseppe Moleto, believed Easter should be computed from the true motions of the sun and moon, rather than using a tabular method, but these recommendations were not adopted.

The Church of Alexandria celebrated Easter on the Sunday after the 14th day of the moon (computed using the Metonic cycle) that falls on or after the vernal equinox, which they placed on 21 March. However, the Church of Rome still regarded 25 March as the equinox (until 342) and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon. In the Alexandrian system, since the 14th day of the Easter moon could fall at earliest on 21 March its first day could fall no earlier than 8 March and no later than 5 April. This meant that Easter varied between 22 March and 25 April. In Rome, Easter was not allowed to fall later than 21 April, that being the day of the Parilia or birthday of Rome and a pagan festival.The first day of the Easter moon could fall no earlier than 5 March and no later than 2 April.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who thought that the seasonal drift in the date of Easter unacceptable?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Catholic Church</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What even is tired to the date for Easter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">spring equinox</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Church of Alexandria use to calculate the date of Easter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Metonic cycle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Church of Alexandria place the vernal equinox?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21 March</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Until 342 when did the Church of Rome think the vernal equinox fell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25 March</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Ancient tables provided the sun's mean longitude. Christopher Clavius, the architect of the Gregorian calendar, noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year. Tycho Brahe also noticed discrepancies. The Gregorian leap year rule (97 leap years in 400 years) was put forward by Petrus Pitatus of Verona in 1560. He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the Alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (De revolutionibus) and Reinhold (Prutenic tables). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 14,33,9,57 (Alphonsine), 14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold). All values are the same to two places (14:33) and this is also the mean length of the Gregorian year.
