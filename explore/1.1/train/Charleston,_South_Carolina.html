It moved to its present location on Oyster Point in 1680 from a location on the west bank of the Ashley River known as Albemarle Point. By 1690, Charles Town was the fifth-largest city in North America, and it remained among the 10 largest cities in the United States through the 1840 census. With a 2010 census population of 120,083  (and a 2014 estimate of 130,113), current trends put Charleston as the fastest-growing municipality in South Carolina. The population of the Charleston metropolitan area, comprising Berkeley, Charleston, and Dorchester Counties, was counted by the 2014 estimate at 727,689 – the third-largest in the state – and the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Charleston founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1670</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Charleston's original name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Town</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Charles Town was named after which king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Charles II of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the city originally located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albemarle Point</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Charleston's population in 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">120,083</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Charleston originally founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1670</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Charles Town named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Charles II of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the originally name of Charleston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Town</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people lived in Charleston in 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">120,083</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Charleston's first location?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albemarle Point</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 127.5 square miles (330.2 km2), of which 109.0 square miles (282.2 km2) is land and 18.5 square miles (47.9 km2) is covered by water.

The city limits have expanded across the Ashley River from the peninsula, encompassing the majority of West Ashley as well as James Island and some of Johns Island. The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassing Daniel Island and the Cainhoy area.

It is typically heard in wealthy white families who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raises ay and aw in certain environments, and is nonrhotic. Sylvester Primer of the College of Charleston wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: &quot;Charleston Provincialisms&quot; (1887)  and &quot;The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms&quot;, published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on the English as it was spoken by the earliest settlers, therefore derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The rapidly disappearing &quot;Charleston accent&quot; is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Some elderly (and usually upper-class) Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as &quot;Chah-l-ston&quot;. Some observers attribute these unique features of Charleston's speech to its early settlement by French Huguenots and Sephardic Jews (who were primarily English speakers from London), both of whom played influential roles in Charleston's early development and history.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">&quot;Charleston's Provincialisms&quot; was published in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1887</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To which two early cultures are the unique characteristics of Charleston's accent attributed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French Huguenots and Sephardic Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To which college did Sylvester Primer belong?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">College of Charleston</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the author of the work entitled, &quot;The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sylvester Primer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of journal were Primer's work on Charleston's accent published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German journal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Charleston annually hosts Spoleto Festival USA founded by Gian Carlo Menotti, a 17-day art festival featuring over 100 performances by individual artists in a variety of disciplines.

The Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge and Septima Clark Expressway are part of U.S. Highway 17, which travels east-west through the cities of Charleston and Mount Pleasant. The Mark Clark Expressway, or Interstate 526, is the bypass around the city and begins and ends at U.S. Highway 17. U.S. Highway 52 is Meeting Street and its spur is East Bay Street, which becomes Morrison Drive after leaving the east side. This highway merges with King Street in the city's Neck area (industrial district). U.S. Highway 78 is King Street in the downtown area, eventually merging with Meeting Street.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What area in Charleston is considered the 'industrial area'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the city's Neck area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What highways is King Street in downtown Charleston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. Highway 78</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">U.S. Highway 78 merges with what street?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Meeting Street</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Interstate 526 begins and ends at what Highway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. Highway 17</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Interstate 26 begins on what part of Charleston?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">downtown Charleston</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge across the Cooper River opened on July 16, 2005, and was the second-longest cable-stayed bridge in the Americas at the time of its construction.[citation needed] The bridge links Mount Pleasant with downtown Charleston, and has eight lanes plus a 12-foot lane shared by pedestrians and bicycles.
