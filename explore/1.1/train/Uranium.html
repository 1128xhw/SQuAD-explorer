While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost.

Argonne National Laboratory's Experimental Breeder Reactor I, located at the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station near Arco, Idaho, became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951. Initially, four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor, but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility (later, the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by BORAX-III, another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory). The world's first commercial scale nuclear power station, Obninsk in the Soviet Union, began generation with its reactor AM-1 on 27 June 1954. Other early nuclear power plants were Calder Hall in England, which began generation on 17 October 1956, and the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which began on 26 May 1958. Nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine, the USS Nautilus, in 1954.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the world's first artificial nuclear reactor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Enrico Fermi's Chicago Pile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what state is the X-10 Graphite Reactor located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tennessee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the X-10 Pile, what was the X-10 Graphite Reactor previously known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Clinton Pile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what state is Argonne National Laboratory's Experimental Breeder Reactor I located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Idaho</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Breeder Reactor I first make electricity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20 December 1951</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water.

If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons.

The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome, Orso Mario Corbino, christened ausonium and hesperium, respectively. The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium's ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. Lise Meitner and her nephew, the physicist Otto Robert Frisch, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process &quot;nuclear fission&quot;. Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235. Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by thermal neutrons. These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was it observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons results in beta ray emission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1934</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the team that discovered that bombarding uranium with neutrons created beta ray emissions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Enrico Fermi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name given by Corbino to the incorrectly designated atomic number 94?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hesperium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the job title of Orso Mario Corbino?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dean of the Faculty of Rome</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the aunt of Otto Robert Frisch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lise Meitner</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The interactions of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution.

Uranyl (UO2+
2) ions, such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds, have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially radon, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to strontium-90, iodine-131, and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure, but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons. Although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities, those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself.

The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the Manhattan Project. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers.
