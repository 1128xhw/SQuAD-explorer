Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty. The Song of the Yue Boatman (Chinese: 越人歌, p Yuèrén Gē, lit. &quot;Song of the man of Yue&quot;) was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in north China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The Yue peoples seem to have had their own written script. The Sword of Goujian bears bird-worm seal script. Yuenü (Chinese: 越女; pinyin: Yuènǚ; Wade–Giles: Yüeh-nü; literally: &quot;the Lady of Yue&quot;) was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. In order to check the growth of the kingdom of Wu, Chu pursued a policy of strengthening Yue. Under King Goujian, Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in 473 BC. The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around Mount Kuaiji in present-day Shaoxing to the former Wu capital at present-day Suzhou. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333 BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue's former lands were annexed by the Qin Empire in 222 BC and organized into a commandery named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in Wu in Jiangsu.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who populated the areas of Zhejiang in the 2nd millennium BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hundred Yue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the kingdom of Yue begin to appear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spring and Autumn Period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the kingdom of Yue located according to chronicles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">northern Zhejiang</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does Shiji claim that its leaders were descended from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yu the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Sword of Goujian bear?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bird-worm seal script</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kuaiji Commandery was the initial power base for Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu's rebellion against the Qin Empire which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but eventually fell to the Han.

Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name &quot;Zhuge&quot;. The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available, mainly north Jiangsu, west Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui,and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of Sichuan was another hub for refugees, given that the state of Shu had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from the north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The rump Jin state or the Southern Dynasties vied against some elite Chinese from the Central Plain and south of the Yangtze River.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Jin Dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">265–420</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the clan of Zhuge Liang gather together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Zhuge Village isolate itself until?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">this day</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of geography is in Zhejiang?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mountainous</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Zhuge Liang live from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">181–234</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Zhejiang, as the heartland of the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the Six Dynasties (220 or 222–589), Sui, and Tang. After being incorporated into the Sui dynasty, its economic richness was used for the Sui dynasty's ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into Korea and Vietnam. The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's Jiangnan East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the Tang dynasty, The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to North China plain and metropolitan centers of the empire.

In 1876, Wenzhou became Zhejiang's second treaty port.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which war did the British navy defeat Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the First Opium War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Treaty of Nanking signed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1843</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What became one of the five Chinese treaty ports under the terms of the Treaty of Nanking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ningbo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did much of Zhejiang come under control of during the Taiping Rebellion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Wenzhou become Zhejiang's second treaty port?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1876</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Second Sino-Japanese War, which led into World War II, much of Zhejiang was occupied by Japan and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the Reorganized National Government of China.

During the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), Zhejiang was in chaos and disunity, and its economy was stagnant, especially during the high tide (1966–69) of the revolution. The agricultural policy favoring grain production at the expense of industrial and cash crops intensified economic hardships in the province. Mao’s self-reliance policy and the reduction in maritime trade cut off the lifelines of the port cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou. While Mao invested heavily in railroads in interior China, no major railroads were built in South Zhejiang, where transportation remained poor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the People's Republic of China take control of Mainland China?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Republic of China control the Dachen Islands until?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1955</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Cultural Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1966–76</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the high tide of the Cultural Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1966–69</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What production did the agricultural policy favor over industrial and cash crops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Zhejiang benefited less from central government investment than some other provinces due to its lack of natural resources, a location vulnerable to potential flooding from the sea, and an economic base at the national average.

In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the &quot;Zhejiang model&quot;, which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the &quot;Zhejiang spirit&quot; has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year.
