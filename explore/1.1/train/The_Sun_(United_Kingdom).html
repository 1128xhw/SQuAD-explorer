It had an average daily circulation of 2.2 million copies in March 2014. Between July and December 2013 the paper had an average daily readership of approximately 5.5 million, with approximately 31% of those falling into the ABC1 demographic and 68% in the C2DE demographic. Approximately 41% of readers are women. The Sun has been involved in many controversies in its history, including its coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster. Regional editions of the newspaper for Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are published in Glasgow (The Scottish Sun), Belfast (The Sun) and Dublin (The Irish Sun) respectively.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which newspaper overtook The Sun as largest Saturday UK newspaper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daily Mail</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the sun's circulation per day in March 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2.2 million copies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the largest demographic for readers of The Sun?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">C2DE demographic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the percentage of The Sun readers who are women?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Approximately 41%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one controversial event covered by The Sun?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 26 February 2012, The Sun on Sunday was launched to replace the closed News of the World, employing some of its former journalists.

A topless Page 3 model gradually became a regular fixture, and with increasingly risqué poses. Both feminists and many cultural conservatives saw the pictures as pornographic and misogynistic. Lamb expressed some regret at introducing the feature, although denied it was sexist. A Conservative council in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, was the first to ban the paper from its public library, shortly after Page 3 began, because of its excessive sexual content. This decision was reversed after a sustained campaign by the newspaper itself lasting 16 months, and the election of a Labour-led council in 1971.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Lamb employ as an important theme from the beginning of the paper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sex</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the first Page 3 model appear topless?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">17 November 1970</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first Page 3 topless model?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stephanie Rahn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first to prohibit the paper from being in its library?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Conservative council in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the library ban reversed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Politically, The Sun in the early Murdoch years, remained nominally Labour.

The singer-songwriter was abroad on the day indicated in the story, as former Sun journalist John Blake, recently poached by the Daily Mirror, soon discovered. After further stories, in September 1987, The Sun accused John of having his Rottweiler guard dogs voice boxes surgically removed. In November, the Daily Mirror found their rival's only source for the rent boy story and he admitted it was a totally fictitious concoction created for money. The inaccurate story about his dogs, actually Alsatians, put pressure on The Sun, and John received £1 million in an out of court settlement, then the largest damages payment in British history. The Sun ran a front-page apology on 12 December 1988, under the banner headline &quot;SORRY, ELTON&quot;.

Three days later the paper apologised in another editorial which said The Sun would never again reveal a person's sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of &quot;overwhelming public interest&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Blair agree to in order to get the support of Rupert Murdoch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Cabinet Minister in 1998?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peter Mandelson</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened on BBC's Newsnight in 1998?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peter Mandelson was &quot;outed&quot; by Matthew Parris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was editor of The Sun in 1998?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Yelland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did The Sun say its policy about revealing an individual's sexuality would be moving forward?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Sun would never again reveal a person's sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of &quot;overwhelming public interest&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2003 the paper was accused of racism by the Government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the &quot;open door&quot; policy on immigration. The attacks came from the Prime Minister's press spokesman Alastair Campbell and the Home Secretary David Blunkett (later a Sun columnist). The paper rebutted the claim, believing that it was not racist to suggest that a &quot;tide&quot; of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases. It did not help its argument by publishing a front page story on 4 July 2003, under the headline &quot;Swan Bake&quot;, which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans. It later proved to have no basis in fact. Subsequently The Sun published a follow-up headlined &quot;Now they're after our fish!&quot;. Following a Press Complaints Commission adjudication a &quot;clarification&quot; was eventually printed, on page 41. In 2005 The Sun published photographs of Prince Harry sporting a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party. The photographs caused outrage across the world and Clarence House was forced to issue a statement in response apologising for any offence or embarrassment caused.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What allegation did the government level against The Sun in 2003?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">racism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who specifically leveled the allegations against The Sun?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prime Minister's press spokesman Alastair Campbell and the Home Secretary David Blunkett</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a 4 July 2003 front page story claim?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From which issue did claims that The Sun was racist stem?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">immigration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did The Sun print pictures of in a Nazi outfit in 2005?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prince Harry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite being a persistent critic of some of the government's policies, the paper supported Labour in both subsequent elections the party won.

The subterfuge involved conning the singer into believing that she was being considered for a role in an £8 million Bollywood film.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the subject of an early June 2013 front page story?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tulisa Contostavlos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the story on Tulisa Contostavlos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mahzer Mahmood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main allegation in The Sun's story on Contostavlos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that Tulisa introduced three film producers (actually Mahmood and two other Sun journalists) to a drug dealer and set up a £800 deal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did The Sun reporters make Contostavlos believe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that she was being considered for a role in an £8 million Bollywood film</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of the front page story on Contostavlos?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tulisa's cocaine deal shame</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At her subsequent trial, the case against Tulisa collapsed at Southwark Crown Court in July 2014, with the judge commenting that there were &quot;strong grounds&quot; to believe that Mahmood had lied at a pre-trial hearing and tried to manipulate evidence against the co-defendant Tulisa.

All six were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. They included The Sun's head of news Chris Pharo, who faced six charges, while ex-managing editor Graham Dudman and ex-Sun deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll were accused of four charges each. Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards were charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup was accused of two counts. The trial related to illegal payments allegedly made to public officials, with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002–11, including police, prison officers and soldiers. They were accused of buying confidential information about the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates. They all denied the charges. On 16 January 2015, Troup and Edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them. The jury also partially cleared O'Driscoll and Dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them, as well as the charges against Pharo and Pyatt. On 21 January 2015, the jury told the court that it was unable to reach unanimous verdicts on any of the outstanding charges and was told by the judge, Richard Marks, that he would accept majority verdicts. Shortly afterwards, one of the jurors sent a note to the judge and was discharged. The judge told the remaining 11 jurors that their colleague had been &quot;feeling unwell and feeling under a great deal of pressure and stress from the situation you are in&quot;, and that under the circumstances he was prepared to accept majority verdicts of &quot;11 to zero or 10 to 1&quot;. On 22 January 2015, the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that it would seek a retrial.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Sun staff accused of in a 2014 trial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was at issue in the 2014 trial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">illegal payments allegedly made to public officials</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were The Sun staffers accused of buying information about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the judge in this particular case?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard Marks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the outcome of the jury's deliberation in the trial?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 6 February 2015, it was announced that Judge Richard Marks is to be replaced by Judge Charles Wide at the retrial.

Reporting the decision in UK newspaper The Guardian, Lisa O’Carroll wrote: &quot;Wide is the only judge so far to have presided in a case which has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories. The journalist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is appealing the verdict&quot;. Defence counsel for the four journalists threatened to take the decision to judicial review, with the barrister representing Pharo, Nigel Rumfitt QC, saying: &quot;The way this has come about gives rise to the impression that something has been going on behind the scenes which should not have been going on behind the scenes and which should have been dealt with transparently&quot;. He added that the defendants were &quot;extremely concerned&quot; and &quot;entitled&quot; to know why Marks was being replaced by Wide.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was appointed presiding judge over the retrial in 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles Wide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which newspaper did Lisa O'Carroll report the choice of judge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Guardian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Pharo's lawyer in the case?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nigel Rumfitt QC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Rumfit state that the defendants should have been informed about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">why Marks was being replaced by Wide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the lawyers for the defendants threaten to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">take the decision to judicial review</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 22 May 2015, Sun reporter Anthony France was found guilty of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office between 2008 and 2011.

He had paid a total of more than £22,000 to PC Timothy Edwards, an anti-terrorism police officer based at Heathrow Airport. The police officer had already pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and given a two-year gaol sentence in 2014, but the jury in France’s trial was not informed of this.

As a result of the change in the CPS’ policy, charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials – including civil servants, health workers and prison staff - had been dropped. In July 2015, Private Eye magazine reported that at a costs hearing at the Old Bailey The Sun's parent company had refused to pay for the prosecution costs relating to France’s trial, leading the presiding judge to express his &quot;considerable disappointment&quot; at this state of affairs. Judge Timothy Pontius said in court that France’s illegal actions had been part of a &quot;clearly recognised procedure at The Sun&quot;, adding that, &quot;There can be no doubt that News International bears some measure of moral responsibility if not legal culpability for the acts of the defendant&quot;. The Private Eye report noted that despite this The Sun's parent organisation was &quot;considering disciplinary actions&quot; against France whilst at the same time it was also preparing to bring a case to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal against the London Metropolitan Police Service for its actions relating to him and two other journalists.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first journalist convicted as a result of Operation Elveden since it had been revised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the change made to Operation Elveden by the Crown Prosecution Service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prosecutions would only be brought against journalists who had made payments to police officers over a period of time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which judge commented on France's unlawful activities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Timothy Pontius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who else did Judge Pontius believe should be blamed for France's actions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">News International</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was News International considering bringing a case against?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the London Metropolitan Police Service</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In August 2013, The Irish Sun ended the practice of featuring topless models on Page 3.
