Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad. The word &quot;Quran&quot; occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran, although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which angel is believed to have communicated the Quran to Muhammad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gabriel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On which date did Muhammad begin receiving the Quran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22 December 609 CE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year CE did Muhammad die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">632</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Arabic variant of Gabriel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jibril</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times is the word &quot;Quran&quot; used in the Quran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">70</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to the traditional narrative, several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations.

It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence. The Quran is used along with the hadith to interpret sharia law.

It is a verbal noun (maṣdar) of the Arabic verb qaraʼa (قرأ), meaning &quot;he read&quot; or &quot;he recited&quot;. The Syriac equivalent is (ܩܪܝܢܐ) qeryānā, which refers to &quot;scripture reading&quot; or &quot;lesson&quot;. While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is qaraʼa itself. Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime. An important meaning of the word is the &quot;act of reciting&quot;, as reflected in an early Quranic passage: &quot;It is for Us to collect it and to recite it (qurʼānahu).&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From which Arabic verb might &quot;Quran&quot; be derived?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">qaraʼa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Syriac word might be related to &quot;Quran&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">qeryānā</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The words from which the name &quot;Quran&quot; might be described are related to which act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reciting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which word do most Muslim scholars point to as the origin of the Quran's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">qaraʼa</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The term also has closely related synonyms that are employed throughout the Quran. Each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but its use may converge with that of qurʼān in certain contexts. Such terms include kitāb (book); āyah (sign); and sūrah (scripture). The latter two terms also denote units of revelation. In the large majority of contexts, usually with a definite article (al-), the word is referred to as the &quot;revelation&quot; (waḥy), that which has been &quot;sent down&quot; (tanzīl) at intervals. Other related words are: dhikr (remembrance), used to refer to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and ḥikmah (wisdom), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which term used in the Quran to indicate itself means &quot;book&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kitāb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which term does the Quran use to refer to itself as &quot;scripture&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sūrah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What meaning does the Quran take when it calls itself hikmah?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wisdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What name does the Quran use for itself that means &quot;revelation&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">waḥy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Quran describes itself as &quot;the discernment&quot; (al-furqān), &quot;the mother book&quot; (umm al-kitāb), &quot;the guide&quot; (huda), &quot;the wisdom&quot; (hikmah), &quot;the remembrance&quot; (dhikr) and &quot;the revelation&quot; (tanzīl; something sent down, signifying the descent of an object from a higher place to lower place).

Thereafter, he received revelations over a period of 23 years. According to hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad immigrated to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws, which were revealed daily. It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken, the Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and the wide, flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, the making of prayer and the manner of recitation. However, the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad's death in 632. There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which mountain cave did Mohammad experience his first revelation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cave of Hira</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Mohammad move to found a separate Muslim community?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Medina</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prisoners from which battle are thought to have helped Muslims learn to write?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Badr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Vegetation from which tree served as an early recording medium for the Quran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">date palm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Muhammad dies, what had not yet been compiled as a book?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quran</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Quran describes Muhammad as &quot;ummi&quot;, which is traditionally interpreted as &quot;illiterate,&quot; but the meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators such as Al-Tabari maintained that the term induced two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; second, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures (but they gave priority to the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as Watt prefer the second meaning of &quot;ummi&quot; - they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with earlier sacred texts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common interpretation of the word &quot;ummi&quot; that the Quran applies to Muhammad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">illiterate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Because Mohammed was &quot;ummi,&quot; what would he not have known about that lent credence to his prophethood?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">earlier sacred texts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term does the Quran use to describe Mohammad's lack of exposure to scripture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ummi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What skills would have made others more suspicious that Mohammad was not getting his revelations in the way he said?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">writing and reading</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Based on earlier transmitted reports, in the year 632, after the demise of Muhammad a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in a battle by Musaylimah, the first caliph Abu Bakr (d. 634) decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since &quot;he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle&quot;. Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which caliph decided to preserve the Quran as a single book after some of Muhammad's companions were killed in battle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abu Bakr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which scribe led the production of the first written Quran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zayd ibn Thabit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did Abu Bakr die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">634</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took possession of the first Quran manuscript after Abu Bakr?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hafsa bint Umar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which caliph ordered the Quran manuscript copied and standardized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uthman ibn Affan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that were later proved to be the most ancient Quranic text known to exist at the time.

The Quran is considered an inimitable miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day of Resurrection—and, thereby, the central proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: &quot;If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another.&quot; So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran, come forward and create something like it. From the ninth century, numerous works appeared which studied the Quran and examined its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars including al-Jurjani (d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations in individual level and in the history. Some scholars state that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science. The doctrine of miraculousness of the Quran is further emphasized by Muhammad's illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the Quran.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term indicates that the contents of the Quran cannot be reproduced in speech?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">I'jaz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Until what day is the Quran believed to be in effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Day of Resurrection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the Medieval Muslim scholar al-Baqillani die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Muslim scholar studied the Quran's inimitability until his death in 1078?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">al-Jurjani</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Quran consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths, each known as a sura. Suras are classified as Meccan or Medinan, depending on whether the verses were revealed before or after the migration of Muhammad to the city of Medina. However, a sura classified as Medinan may contain Meccan verses in it and vice versa. Sura titles are derived from a name or quality discussed in the text, or from the first letters or words of the sura. Suras are arranged roughly in order of decreasing size.

Sulami's major commentary is a book named haqaiq al-tafsir (&quot;Truths of Exegesis&quot;) which is a compilation of commentaries of earlier Sufis. From the 11th century onwards several other works appear, including commentaries by Qushayri (d. 1074), Daylami (d. 1193), Shirazi (d. 1209) and Suhrawardi (d. 1234). These works include material from Sulami's books plus the author's contributions. Many works are written in Persian such as the works of Maybudi (d. 1135) kash al-asrar (&quot;the unveiling of the secrets&quot;). Rumi (d. 1273) wrote a vast amount of mystical poetry in his book Mathnawi. Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in translations of Rumi's work. A large number of Quranic passages can be found in Mathnawi, which some consider a kind of Sufi interpretation of the Quran. Rumi's book is not exceptional for containing citations from and elaboration on the Quran, however, Rumi does mention Quran more frequently. Simnani (d. 1336) wrote two influential works of esoteric exegesis on the Quran. He reconciled notions of God's manifestation through and in the physical world with the sentiments of Sunni Islam. Comprehensive Sufi commentaries appear in the 18th century such as the work of Ismail Hakki Bursevi (d. 1725). His work ruh al-Bayan (the Spirit of Elucidation) is a voluminous exegesis. Written in Arabic, it combines the author's own ideas with those of his predecessors (notably Ibn Arabi and Ghazali), all woven together in Hafiz, a Persian poetry form.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was an important esoteric interpreter of the Quran in the 11th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sulami</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the English name of Sulami's major work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Truths of Exegesis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which language did Maybudi write?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Sufi commentator wrote the Spirit of Elucidation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ismail Hakki Bursevi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the poet Rumi die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1273</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Commentaries dealing with the zahir (outward aspects) of the text are called tafsir, and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the batin are called ta'wil (&quot;interpretation&quot; or &quot;explanation&quot;), which involves taking the text back to its beginning.

The first Quranic manuscripts lacked these marks, therefore several recitations remain acceptable. The variation in readings of the text permitted by the nature of the defective vocalization led to an increase in the number of readings during the 10th century. The 10th-century Muslim scholar from Baghdad, Ibn Mujāhid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable textual readings of the Quran. He studied various readings and their trustworthiness and chose seven 8th-century readers from the cities of Mecca, Medina, Kufa, Basra and Damascus. Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers, rather than six or ten, but this may be related to a prophetic tradition (Muhammad's saying) reporting that the Quran had been revealed in seven &quot;ahruf&quot; (meaning seven letters or modes). Today, the most popular readings are those transmitted by Ḥafṣ (d.796) and Warsh (d. 812) which are according to two of Ibn Mujahid's reciters, Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud (Kufa, d. 745) and Nafi‘ al-Madani (Medina, d. 785), respectively. The influential standard Quran of Cairo (1924) uses an elaborate system of modified vowel-signs and a set of additional symbols for minute details and is based on ʻAsim's recitation, the 8th-century recitation of Kufa. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The absence of which language feature made early Quranic recitation more diverse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vocalization markers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Baghdad scholar identified justified seven different Quranic readings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ibn Mujāhid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which century produced the seven readings selected by Ibn Mujāhid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which recitation is the original basis of the Quran of Cairo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ʻAsim's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city corresponds to Asim's recitation of the Quran?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kufa</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by calligraphers and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in Ḥijāzī-type script. The Hijazi style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as Kufic scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore chose simpler writing styles. Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the naskh, muhaqqaq, rayḥānī and, on rarer occasions, the thuluth script. Naskh was in very widespread use. In North Africa and Spain, the Maghribī style was popular. More distinct is the Bihari script which was used solely in the north of India. Nastaʻlīq style was also rarely used in Persian world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created Quranic manuscripts before the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">calligraphers and copyists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the thicker-stroked writing used for the Quran beginning in the 9th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kufic scripts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which was the most widely used script by copyists in the 11th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">naskh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Maghribi script most commonly used by Quran copyists?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Africa and Spain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which script was only used to copy the Quran by people in northern India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bihari</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the beginning, the Quran did not have vocalization markings.

Although this unacceptable ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to the Quranic verses. The correct interpretation is that reality a verse refers to.

But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of ta'wil, which originally meant &quot;to return&quot; or &quot;the returning place&quot;. In Tabatabaei's view, what has been rightly called ta'wil, or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran, is not concerned simply with the denotation of words. Rather, it is concerned with certain truths and realities that transcend the comprehension of the common run of men; yet it is from these truths and realities that the principles of doctrine and the practical injunctions of the Quran issue forth. Interpretation is not the meaning of the verse—rather it transpires through that meaning, in a special sort of transpiration. There is a spiritual reality—which is the main objective of ordaining a law, or the basic aim in describing a divine attribute—and then there is an actual significance that a Quranic story refers to.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original meaning of ta'wil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;to return&quot; or &quot;the returning place&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can interpretation find that lies the behind the apparent events referred to in a Quranic story?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a spiritual reality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophical term corresponds to the type of interpretation in ta'wil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hermeneutic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Shia beliefs, those who are firmly rooted in knowledge like Muhammad and the imams know the secrets of the Quran. According to Tabatabaei, the statement &quot;none knows its interpretation except God&quot; remains valid, without any opposing or qualifying clause. Therefore, so far as this verse is concerned, the knowledge of the Quran's interpretation is reserved for God. But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know the interpretation of the Quran to a certain extent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who do Shia Muslims believe can approach Quranic truths besides God and Muhammad?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">imams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Shia Muslims, who is the only one who can fully know the a Quranic interpretation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How must God have treated those who are qualified to know Quranic sectets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">purified</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
