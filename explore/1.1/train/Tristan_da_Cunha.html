The territory consists of the main island, also named Tristan da Cunha, which has a north–south length of 11.27 kilometres (7.00 mi) and has an area of 98 square kilometres (38 sq mi), along with the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible and Gough Islands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what type of islands are the Tristan da Cunha</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">volcanic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">where are the islands of Tristan da Cunha located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">south Atlantic Ocean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">how many square kilometres  is the island?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">98</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what type of island group are the islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">archipelago</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tristan da Cunha is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.

Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520, when the Lás Rafael captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called at Tristan for water. The first undisputed landing was made in 1643 by the crew of the Heemstede, captained by Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in what year were the islands first sighted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1506</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what was the name of the explorer that sighted them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tristão da Cunha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">who was the main island named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">what year was it said the first island landing was made?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1520</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert, from Salem, Massachusetts, United States, who arrived at the islands in December 1810 with two other men.
