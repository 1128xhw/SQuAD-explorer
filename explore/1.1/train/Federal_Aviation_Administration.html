Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a &quot;culture of coziness&quot; between senior FAA officials and the airlines and &quot;a systematic breakdown&quot; in the FAA's culture that resulted in &quot;malfeasance, bordering on corruption.&quot; In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did two whisleblowers allege that Boutris  attempted to ground Southwest Airlines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many planes did the FAA managers allow to fly in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">46</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the FAA propose to fine Southwest for failing to inspect older planes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$10.2 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What former chairman of the committee said it's investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jim Oberstar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many planes were allowed to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety regulations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">117</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On July 22, 2008, in the aftermath of the Southwest Airlines inspection scandal, a bill was unanimously approved in the House to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures, including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year &quot;cooling off&quot; period that FAA inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they regulated.

The FAA became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. Legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety.

A nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. During the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing.

Implementation will vary among airlines. The FAA expects many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. If an air carrier provides Wi-Fi service during flight, passengers may use it. Short-range Bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards, can also be used.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the FAA decide to expand passengers use of portable elctronic devices during all phases of flight?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 31, 2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mode must mobile phones be put into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">airplane mode</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What phases of flight will passengers be able to use electronic devices?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all phases</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where must devices be put during actual takeoff and landing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seat-back pocket</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are short-range bluetooth accessories able to be used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">can also be used.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1967, a new U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport.

Rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2 million fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story: &quot;Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer. At $25,000 per violation, Gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.&quot; Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate. The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. For example, to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an FAA regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What retired NASA Office of inspector general is outspoken about the FAA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joseph Gutheinz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much do penalties against airlines cost per violation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$25,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A heavy penalty for violating FAA reulations could said to be do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">impact their ability to continue operating</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the agency propose to find Southwest Airlines?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$10.2 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
