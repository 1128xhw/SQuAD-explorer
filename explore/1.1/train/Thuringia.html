During the GDR period, church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990. Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious. The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state, adhered to by 24.0% of the population in 2009. Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.8% of the population, while 68.2% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths. The highest Protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western Thuringia, whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious (up to 88% in Gera). Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia. Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common Christian denomination in Thuringia? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lutheranism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the Thuringia population is non-religious?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Today over two thirds of the population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which church in the state has the largest amount of members?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the Thuringia population are Catholic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7.8% of the population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Jews live in Thuringia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">750 Jews</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The name Thuringia or Thüringen derives from the Germanic tribe Thuringii, who emerged during the Migration Period.

Most of the remaining Thuringia came under the rule of the Wettin dynasty of the nearby Margraviate of Meissen, the nucleus of the later Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony. With the division of the house of Wettin in 1485, Thuringia went to the senior Ernestine branch of the family, which subsequently subdivided the area into a number of smaller states, according to the Saxon tradition of dividing inheritance amongst male heirs. These were the &quot;Saxon duchies&quot;, consisting, among others, of the states of Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eisenach, Saxe-Jena, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg, and Saxe-Gotha; Thuringia became merely a geographical concept.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Thuringia become a landgraviate? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in 1130 AD</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which years were the War of the Thuringian Succession fought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1247–1264</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the western half of the state become Hesse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1247</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Wettin dynasty from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Margraviate of Meissen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Saxon Duchies consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the states of Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eisenach, Saxe-Jena, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg, and Saxe-Gotha</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Thuringia generally accepted the Protestant Reformation, and Roman Catholicism was suppressed as early as 1520[citation needed]; priests who remained loyal to it were driven away and churches and monasteries were largely destroyed, especially during the German Peasants' War of 1525. In Mühlhausen and elsewhere, the Anabaptists found many adherents. Thomas Müntzer, a leader of some non-peaceful groups of this sect, was active in this city.

The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line. In 1920, after World War I, these small states merged into one state, called Thuringia; only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead. Weimar became the new capital of Thuringia.

The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km² wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): Dün, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffhäuser, Hohe Schrecke, Schmücke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, Hörselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner Höhe and Heilinger Höhen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Großer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rhön Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Weiße Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of Weiße Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Pleiße river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the Harz mountains located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The far north</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the landscape of Eichsfeld? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hilly and sometimes forested</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Thuringia's highest mountain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Großer Beerberg</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Orlasenke located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the middle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many big rivers flow through Thuringia? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Saale in the west and the Weiße Elster in the east</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most important river in Thuringia is the Saale (a tributary of the Elbe) with its tributaries Unstrut, Ilm and Weiße Elster, draining the most parts of Thuringia and the Werra (the headwater of the Weser), draining the south-west and west of the Land. Furthermore, some small parts on the southern border are drained by tributaries of the Main (a tributary of the Rhine).

However, most of the plains have been cleared and are in intensive agricultural use while most of the forests are planted with spruce and pine. Since 1990, Thuringia's forests have been managed aiming for a more natural and tough vegetation more resilient to climate change as well as diseases and vermin.

Well-known industrial centres are Jena (a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik) and Eisenach, where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today. The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking, vehicle production and food industries.

Following the industrial revolution, the old iron, copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong. On the other hand, the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia: the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s, and two potash mining districts were established around 1900. These are the Südharzrevier in the north of the state, between Bischofferode in the west and Roßleben in the east with Sondershausen at its centre, and the Werrarevier on the Hessian border around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west. Together, they accounted for a significant part of the world's potash production in the mid-20th century. After the reunification, the Südharzrevier was abandoned, whereas K+S took over the mines in the Werrarevier. Between 1950 and 1990, uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union's need for this metal. The centre was Ronneburg near Gera in eastern Thuringia and the operating company Wismut was under direct Soviet control.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which towns in Thuringia are known as mining towns?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Schmalkalden, Suhl and Ilmenau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the iron, copper and silver mines fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because the competition from imported metal was too strong</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one of the two mining districts were established around 1900?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Südharzrevier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Thuringian miners do to help the Soviet Union?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union's need for this metal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Südharzrevier close?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">After the reunification</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The GDP of Thuringia is below the national average, in line with the other former East German Lands.

The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting Würzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and Sömmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges.

It was founded in 1860 and came to prominence as Germany's leading art school during the inter-war period, the Bauhaus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the biggest school in Thuringia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The University of Jena</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many universities are there in Thuringia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many students attend The University of Erfurt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Germany's leading art school in Thuringia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Bauhaus University Weimar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was The Bauhaus University Weimar founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1860</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The polytechnics of Thuringia are based in Erfurt (4,500 students), Jena (5,000 students), Nordhausen (2,500 students) and Schmalkalden (3,000 students).

Both focus on technology, in particular life sciences and optics at Jena and information technology at Ilmenau. Erfurt is a centre of Germany's horticultural research, whereas Weimar and Gotha with their various archives and libraries are centres of historic and cultural research. Most of the research in Thuringia is publicly funded basic research due to the lack of large companies able to invest significant amounts in applied research, with the notable exception of the optics sector at Jena.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the focus of Thuringia's research center, Jena?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">life sciences and optics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which universities are known for their historic and cultural aspects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Weimar and Gotha</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is most research in Thuringia funded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">publicly funded</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">  What is one company that is able to get investments from large companies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the optics sector at Jena.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first railways in Thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1880. By 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving Thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before World War II with about 2,500 km of track. Between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing Thuringia's network by half compared to 1940. On the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. The most important railway lines at present are the Thuringian Railway, connecting Halle and Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha and Eisenach with Frankfurt and Kassel and the Saal Railway from Halle/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former has an hourly ICE/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ICE trains from Berlin to Munich. In 2017, a new high speed line will be opened, diverting long-distance services from these mid-19th century lines. Both ICE routes will then use the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway, and the Berlin-Munich route will continue via the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway. Only the segment west of Erfurt of the Frankfurt-Dresden line will continue to be used by ICE trains after 2017, with an increased line speed of 200 km/h (currently 160 km/h). Erfurt's central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new connection between both ICE lines. The most important regional railway lines in Thuringia are the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway from Erfurt to Würzburg and Meiningen, the Weimar–Gera railway from Erfurt to Chemnitz, the Sangerhausen–Erfurt railway from Erfurt to Magdeburg, the Gotha–Leinefelde railway from Erfurt to Göttingen, the Halle–Kassel railway from Halle via Nordhausen to Kassel and the Leipzig–Hof railway from Leipzig via Altenburg to Zwickau and Hof. Most regional and local lines have hourly service, but some run only every other hour.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Thuringia's first railway built?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 1840s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were most of the branch lines of the railway abandoned? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Between 1950 and 2000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When will the new high speed train be open? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In 2017, a new high speed line will be opened,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
