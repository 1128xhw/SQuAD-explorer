The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where does the color red in blood come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hemoglobin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does hemoglobin contain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes the color of hematite and red ochre?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">iron oxide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why does a sky turn red when the evening comes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rayleigh scattering</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What pigment is responsible for the color of leaves in fall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anthocyanins</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus Kermes, primarily Kermes vermilio.

When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and his soldiers conquered the Aztec Empire in 1519-1521, they discovered slowly that the Aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold; they had the tiny cochineal, a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants, which, when dried and crushed, made a magnificent red. The cochineal in Mexico was closely related to the Kermes varieties of Europe, but unlike European Kermes, it could be harvested several times a year, and it was ten times stronger than the Kermes of Poland. It worked particularly well on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. In 1523 Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain. Soon cochineal began to arrive in European ports aboard convoys of Spanish galleons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which conquistador from Spain conquered the Aztec Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hernán Cortés</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did a new kind of red pigment arrive in Europe from the Aztec Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what years was the Aztec Empire conquered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1519-1521</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Cortes send the first cochineal to Spain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1523</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How often could the Mexican cochineal be harvested?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several times a year</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant.

Beginning in the 1740s, this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in England, the Netherlands and France. Turkey red used madder as the colorant, but the process was longer and more complicated, involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye, olive oil, sheep's dung, and other ingredients. The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red, similar to carmine, perfectly suited to cotton. The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa, the Middle East and America.

For example, in mandrills, red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males, increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates, and directly correlated with levels of testosterone. Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others, leading to significant differences in mortality, reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not. In humans, wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions, including professional sport and multiplayer video games. Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise, so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance. Judges of tae kwon do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue, and, when asked, a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more &quot;dominant&quot;, &quot;aggressive&quot;, and &quot;likely to win a physical competition&quot; than blue shapes. In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior, exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and elicits aversion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an &quot;achievement&quot; context (e.g. taking an IQ test).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In alpha male mandrills what party of the body is most red according to their rank?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the face</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Wearing red is connected to what result in humans, in terms of sport?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increased performance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what sport have judges been shown to favor athletes wearing red?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tae kwon do</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the effect of exposing a human to red when it comes to cognitive skills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decreases performance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The amount of red in mandrill males is directly related to levels of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">testosterone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Surveys show that red is the color most associated with courage.

Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George's Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trait do people most commonly link red with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">courage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did the Popes of the middle ages wear red?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was depicted on the banners of Christians in the First crusade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a red cross on a white field</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the cross on the banners used during the First Crusade known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. George's Cross</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Saint George believed to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a Roman soldier</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Saint Valentine, a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD, seems to have had no known connection with romantic love, but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar, Saint Valentine's Day (February 14), became, in the 14th century, an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other.

In Chinese cultural traditions, red is associated with weddings (where brides traditionally wear red dresses) and red paper is frequently used to wrap gifts of money or other objects. Special red packets (simplified Chinese: 红包; traditional Chinese: 紅包; pinyin: hóng bāo in Mandarin or lai see in Cantonese) are specifically used during Chinese New Year celebrations for giving monetary gifts. On the more negative side, obituaries are traditionally written in red ink, and to write someone's name in red signals either cutting them out of one's life, or that they have died. Red is also associated with either the feminine or the masculine (yin and yang respectively), depending on the source.

In 2004 Georgia adopted a new white flag, which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Slavic solidarity movement choose red blue and white as their colors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the late nineteenth century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the nation of George get a new national flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is in the middle of the Georgian flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one big red cross</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many small crosses are on the Georgian flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the Pan-Slavic colors originally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the colors of the Russian flag</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Red, white, and black were the colors of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918, and as such they came to be associated with German nationalism. In the 1920s they were adopted as the colors of the Nazi flag. In Mein Kampf, Hitler explained that they were &quot;revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past.&quot; The red part of the flag was also chosen to attract attention - Hitler wrote: &quot;the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster&quot; because &quot;in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.&quot; The red also symbolized the social program of the Nazis, aimed at German workers. Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what time period did the German Empire use the colors red white and black?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870 to 1918</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did red white and black become associated with in Germany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German nationalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose design was the Nazi flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hitler's personal design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what era did red white and black become part of the Nazi flag?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1920s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Red was chosen as part of the Nazi flag to do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">attract attention</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The red flag appeared as a political symbol during the French Revolution, after the fall of Bastille. A law adopted by the new government on October 20, 1789 authorized the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag in the event of a riot, to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries. In the words of his famous hymn, the Marseillaise, Rouget de Lisle wrote: &quot;Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!&quot; (Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the demise of what was the red flag linked to the French Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bastille</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was the Garde Nationale empowered to hoist a red flag to signal their intervention in a riot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 20, 1789</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did the Garde Nationale kill as many as fifty people on Champs de Mars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 17, 1791</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the words &quot;Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rouget de Lisle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the most ardent revolutionaries in France adopt a red flag to symbolize the blood of their fallen comrades?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1790</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Karl Marx published the Communist Manifesto in February 1848, with little attention.
