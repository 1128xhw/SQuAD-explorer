The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most urbanized and densely populated section. It consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges. Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the Sauratown Mountains, Pilot Mountain, the Uwharrie Mountains, Crowder's Mountain, King's Pinnacle, the Brushy Mountains, and the South Mountains. The Piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet (300 m) in the west. Because of the rapid population growth in the Piedmont, a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers, housing, and corporate offices. Agriculture is steadily declining in importance. The major rivers of the Piedmont, such as the Yadkin and Catawba, tend to be fast-flowing, shallow, and narrow.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Pilot Mountain and South Mountains are located in what region of North Carolina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Piedmont</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What section of Central North Carolina has the most dense population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Piedmont region</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average elevation in the west Piedmont region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,000 feet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do you call the line that marks the elevation that waterfalls first appear on rivers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Atlantic Seaboard fall line</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what point does the coastal plin transition to the Piedmont region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">along the Atlantic Seaboard fall line</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The western section of the state is part of the Appalachian Mountain range. Among the subranges of the Appalachians located in the state are the Great Smoky Mountains, Blue Ridge Mountains, Great Balsam Mountains, and Black Mountains. The Black Mountains are the highest in the eastern United States, and culminate in Mount Mitchell at 6,684 feet (2,037 m) the highest point east of the Mississippi River. Although agriculture still remains important, tourism has become a dominant industry in the mountains. Growing Christmas trees has recently become an important industry as well. Because of the higher altitude, the climate in the mountains often differs markedly from that of the rest of the state. Winter in western North Carolina typically features high snowfall and subfreezing temperatures more akin to those of a midwestern state than of a southern state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The weatern part of North Carolina is part of what mountain range?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Appalachian Mountain range</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Great Smokey Mountains and the Black Moutains are subranges of what mountains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Appalachians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mountains are the highest in the eastern United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Black Mountains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the highest point east of the Mississippi river?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mount Mitchell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How high is Mt.

Hurricane Isabel stands out as the most damaging of the 21st century. Tropical storms arrive every 3 or 4 years. In addition, many hurricanes and tropical storms graze the state. In some years, several hurricanes or tropical storms can directly strike the state or brush across the coastal areas. Only Florida and Louisiana are hit by hurricanes more often. Although many people believe that hurricanes menace only coastal areas, the rare hurricane which moves inland quickly enough can cause severe damage; for example, in 1989, Hurricane Hugo caused heavy damage in Charlotte and even as far inland as the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwestern part of the state.

It ceded them to the national government so that the Northwest Territory could be organized and managed nationally.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What state made the smallest contribution to the revolutionary war of any state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Carolina</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many men from NC joined the continental army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7,800</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years were the highest concentration of military action in NC during the revolutionary war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1780–81</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the continental army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General George Washington</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Frontiersmen from the Carolinas moved west into what area that is now known as Tennessee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Washington District</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After 1800, cotton and tobacco became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the Tidewater region, developed a slave society based on a plantation system and slave labor. Many free people of color migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly 3 percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than 10,000. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of Jeffersonian and Jacksonian democracy, with a strong Whig presence, especially in the West. After Nat Turner's slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks.

In 1567 Captain Juan Pardo led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed Cuenca. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to Santa Elena on Parris Island, South Carolina, then a center of Spanish Florida. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and archaeological findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 16th century, where did Spanish explorers meet Mississipian cultureal people?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joara</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Joara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a regional chiefdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where would present day Joara be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">near present-day Morganton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Spanish man that met the people in Joara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hernando de Soto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did hernando de Soto arrive in Joara?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1540</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1584, Elizabeth I granted a charter to Sir Walter Raleigh, for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of Virginia).

Most of the free colored families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men. Because the mothers were free, their children were born free. Many had migrated or were descendants of migrants from colonial Virginia. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in Great Britain, planters imported more slaves, and the state's legal delineations between free and slave status tightened, effectively hardening the latter into a racial caste.

The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did North Carolina instruct its delegates to vote for independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1776</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was north carolina seeking independence from in 1776?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the British Crown</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Americas Victory at King's Mountain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1780</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many North Carolina mountain men fought at King's Mountain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many British troops fought at king's Mountain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The road to Yorktown and America's independence from Great Britain led through North Carolina.

Morgan had moved to the northern part of the state to combine with General Greene's newly recruited forces. Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in present-day Greensboro on March 15, 1781. Although the British troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot;, Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the Royal Navy to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at Yorktown, Virginia, later in 1781.

They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding &quot;yeoman&quot; farmers of western North Carolina.

In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. However, Republican Mitt Romney ultimately eked out a 2-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with Indiana) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">North carolina voters have leaned republican since what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1976</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did North Carolina voters once again vote for a Democrat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2008</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Bill Clinton win North Carolina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Bill Clinton lose North Carolina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1996</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the 2012 democratic national Convention held?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charlotte</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2012, the state elected a Republican Governor (Pat McCrory) and Lieutenant Governor (Dan Forest) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.

Eastern North Carolina pork barbecue uses a vinegar-and-red-pepper-based sauce and the &quot;whole hog&quot; is cooked, thus integrating both white and dark meat.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a culinary staple of North Carolina?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pork barbecue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cut of pork do those in western North carolina prefer for BBQ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boston butt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for Western North Carolina Barbecue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lexington barbecue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cut of pork do those in Western North Carolina prefer for BBQ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pork shoulder</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people visit the lexington Barbecue festival each year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 100,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Krispy Kreme, an international chain of doughnut stores, was started in North Carolina; the company's headquarters are in Winston-Salem.
