This practice is considered exploitative by many international organisations. Legislation across the world prohibit child labour. These laws do not consider all work by children as child labour; exceptions include work by child artists, family duties, supervised training, certain categories of work such as those by Amish children, some forms of child work common among indigenous American children, and others.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does child labour deprive children of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deprives children of their childhood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are child artists an exception to the laws with regards to child labour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exceptions include work by child artists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is work done by Amish children an exception?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">work such as those by Amish children</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is there legislation that prohibits child labour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Legislation across the world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is all work done by children considered to be child labour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">These laws do not consider all work by children as child labour</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In developing countries, with high poverty and poor schooling opportunities, child labour is still prevalent.

Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century).

The children of the poor were expected to contribute to their family income. In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. A high number of children also worked as prostitutes. The author Charles Dickens worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in debtor's prison.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many families were without a bread winner?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one-third</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many water-powered cotton mills used child labour in 1788 England and Scotland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">143</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was it a low amount or high amount of children that also worked in prostitution? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high number</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Charles Dickens employed as a child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blacking factory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Industrial Revolution what was the main driving force behind child labour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">economic hardship</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Throughout the second half of the 19th century, child labour began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and economic factors. The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the &quot;Short Time Committees&quot; in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. Lord Shaftesbury was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the 19th century was there any advocates for the working children?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lord Shaftesbury</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1833 at what age was the limit to working in a textile industry factory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">children under the age of nine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year were both adults and children only able to work 10 hours a day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1847</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 19th century was there an increase or decreased need to child labour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">child labour began to decline</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Britain first inact legislation with regards to child labour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1803</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early 20th century, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries.

When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am.

Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture.

Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations.

In Africa, colonial administrators encouraged traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries. Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies between the ages of 5–14 were hired as an apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in the 19th century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents' nor child's approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master. Other schemes included 'earn-and-learn' programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the legal ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as picannins.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Were young apprentices hired for pay?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">without pay</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was child labour common in European colonies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">child labour was common place in the colonies of European</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the age range of colonial child workers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5–14</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century did apprenticeships begin to take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many children were employed on colonial plantations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Millions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In southeast Asian colonies, such as Hong Kong, child labour such as the Mui Tsai (妹仔), was rationalised as a cultural tradition and ignored by British authorities.

Of all the child workers, the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers.

Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour. Although many actions have been taken to end this epidemic, child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development. Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business. In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit.

Work that many children took part in was not always visible, legal, or paid. Free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood. Yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is, there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period. Due to this lack of documentation, it is hard to determine just how many children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century. The first documentation of child labour in Brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits. Armando Dias, for example, died in November 1913 whilst still very young, a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked. Boys and girls were victims of industrial accidents on a daily basis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Brazil colonized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">April 22, 1550</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who colonized Brazil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pedro Álvares Cabral</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the victims of industrial accidents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boys and girls</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was child labour first documented in Brazil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">during the time of indigenous societies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Armando Dias die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electric shock</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Brazil, the minimum working age has been identified as fourteen due to continuous constitutional amendments that occurred in 1934, 1937, and 1946.

Another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work.

Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family. Child Labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths. Although there are many counts of children under the age of ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen.

The British thus became masters of east India (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade. This led to a large amount of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods. Many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay, and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments. Another reason many Indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights, they did not cause trouble or complain, and they were often more trustworthy. The innocence that comes with childhood was utilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the English East India Company defeat Siraj-ud-Daula?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23 June 1757</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the master of the east of India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were many children employed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increasing need of cheap labour</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the primary reason for India children being employed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lack knowledge of their basic rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did India child workers act?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they did not cause trouble or complain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A variety of Indian social scientists as well as the Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) have done extensive research on the numeric figures of child labour found in India and determined that India contributes to one-third of Asia’s child labour and one-fourth of the world's child labour.

This form of mining uses labour-intensive and low-tech methods. It is informal sector of the economy. Human Rights Watch group estimates that about 12 percent of global gold production comes from artisanal mines. In west Africa, in countries such as Mali - the third largest exporter of gold in Africa - between 20,000 and 40,000 children work in artisanal mining. Locally known as orpaillage, children as young as 6 years old work with their families. These children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including mercury, and do hazardous work such as digging shafts and working underground, pulling up, carrying and crushing the ore. The poor work practices harm the long term health of children, as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers, ground water and lakes. Gold is important to the economy of Mali and Ghana. For Mali, it is the second largest earner of its export revenue. For many poor families with children, it is the primary and sometimes the only source of income.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another source of mining dangerous to children workers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gold</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the third largest exporter of gold in Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is gold vital to the people of Mali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it is the second largest earner of its export revenue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the gold production income of poor families in Mali?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">primary and sometimes the only source of income</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In early August 2008, Iowa Labour Commissioner David Neil announced that his department had found that Agriprocessors, a kosher meatpacking company in Postville which had recently been raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, had employed 57 minors, some as young as 14, in violation of state law prohibiting anyone under 18 from working in a meatpacking plant.
