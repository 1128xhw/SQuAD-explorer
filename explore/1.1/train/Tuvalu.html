It comprises three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5° to 10° south and longitude of 176° to 180°, west of the International Date Line. Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. Tuvalu has a population of 10,640 (2012 census).

The Ellice Islands were administered as British protectorate by a Resident Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), and then as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony from 1916 to 1974.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Tuvalu discovered by a European?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1568</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the discoverer of Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Álvaro de Mendaña</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What land mass was de Mendana actually seeking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Terra Australis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Tuvalu named in 1819?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ellice Islands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what means did the British govern Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British protectorate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about 3000 years ago.

Mourelle's map and journal named the island El Gran Cocal ('The Great Coconut Plantation'); however, the latitude and longitude was uncertain.

While some islanders were voluntary recruits the &quot;blackbirders&quot; were notorious for enticing islanders on to ships with tricks, such as pretending to be Christian missionaries, as well as kidnapping islanders at gun point. The Rev. A. W. Murray, the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu, reported that in 1863 about 170 people were taken from Funafuti and about 250 were taken from Nukulaelae, as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what years did Peruvian ships seek laborers in the Polynesian islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1862–63</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name applied to the trade of dealing with labor hunters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blackbirding</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the earliest missionary to Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rev.

Elekana began proselytising Christianity. He was trained at Malua Theological College, a London Missionary Society (LMS) school in Samoa, before beginning his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu. In 1865 the Rev. A. W. Murray of the LMS – a Protestant congregationalist missionary society – arrived as the first European missionary where he too proselytised among the inhabitants of Tuvalu. By 1878 Protestantism was well established with preachers on each island. In the later 19th and early 20th centuries the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu (Te Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu) were predominantly Samoans, who influenced the development of the Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Christianity arrive in Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1861</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What church deacon was washed ashore on Nukulaelae?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elekana</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What missionary was the first European missionary to come to Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rev.

The United States Marine Corps landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942 and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943. The Japanese had already occupied Tarawa and other islands in what is now Kiribati, but were delayed by the losses at the Battle of the Coral Sea. The islanders assisted the American forces to build airfields on Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau and to unload supplies from ships. On Funafuti the islanders shifted to the smaller islets so as to allow the American forces to build the airfield and to build naval bases and port facilities on Fongafale. A Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) built a sea plane ramp on the lagoon side of Fongafale islet for seaplane operations by both short and long range seaplanes and a compacted coral runway was also constructed on Fongafale, with runways also constructed to create Nanumea Airfield and Nukufetau Airfield. USN Patrol Torpedo Boats (PTs) were based at Funafuti from 2 November 1942 to 11 May 1944.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what purpose was Funafuti used during the Pacific War? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a base</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group occupied the Gilbert Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Japanese forces</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What action delayed the Japanese occupation of the Gilbert Islands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of the Coral Sea</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what time span were USN Torpedo Boats stationed at Funafuti?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2 November 1942 to 11 May 1944</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what islet did US forces build a seaplane ramp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fongafale</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1974 ministerial government was introduced to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony through a change to the Constitution.

The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were &quot;exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature&quot; that justified the grant of resident permits as the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family which had effectively relocated to New Zealand.

Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (EIF), which was established in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. In 2013 Tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as &quot;Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs&quot;. Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status. Prime minister, Enele Sopoaga wants the United Nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from LDC status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like Tuvalu in the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the UN developmental designation for Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">least developed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Tuvalu do in 2013 in regards to it least developed country status?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deferred its graduation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization sponsors an assistance program for least developed countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World Trade Organisation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would Tuvalu have lost as a developed country?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">funding assistance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of problem does the current developed country rating not take into enough consideration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">environmental</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Tuvalu Media Department of the Government of Tuvalu operates Radio Tuvalu which broadcasts from Funafuti.

Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cyclone badly damaged Funafuti?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cyclone Bebe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many cyclones effected Tuvalu during the 1996-97  cyclone season? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cyclone caused major damage to vegetation on all islands on Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cyclone Ofa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first cyclone to strike Tuvalu during the 1996-97 season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cyclone Gavin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What islet was damaged by Cyclone Meli in 1979?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Funafuti's Tepuka Vili Vili</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In March 2015, the winds and storm surge created by Cyclone Pam resulted in waves of 3 metres (9.8 ft) to 5 metres (16 ft) breaking over the reef of the outer islands caused damage to houses, crops and infrastructure. On Nui the sources of fresh water were destroyed or contaminated. The flooding in Nui and Nukufetau caused many families to shelter in evacuation centres or with other families. Nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands (Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu); with both Nui and Nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops. Of the three northern islands (Nanumanga, Niutao, Nanumea), Nanumanga suffered the most damage, with 60-100 houses flooded, with the waves also causing damage to the health facility. Vasafua islet, part of the Funafuti Conservation Area, was severely damaged by Cyclone Pam. The coconut palms were washed away, leaving the islet as a sand bar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the wave heights during Cyclone Pam on Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 metres (9.8 ft) to 5 metres (16 ft)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Cyclone Pam strike Tuvalu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 2015</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During Cyclone Pam which island had the most damage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nui</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Tuvalu crops were destroyed during  Cyclone Pam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The loss of what caused the Vasafua islet to become  a sand bar due to Cyclone Pam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coconut palms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Tuvalu Government carried out assessments of the damage caused by Cyclone Pam to the islands and has provided medical aid, food as well as assistance for the cleaning-up of storm debris.

Gradual sea-level rise also allows for coral polyp activity to increase the reefs. However, if the increase in sea level occurs at faster rate as compared to coral growth, or if polyp activity is damaged by ocean acidification, then the resilience of the atolls and reef islands is less certain.
