An example involves the novel The Saragossa Manuscript by the Polish aristocrat Jan Potocki (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by Edmund Chojecki in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete Saragossa Manuscript have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki’s Polish version.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do researchers use back-translation to try to reconstruct when a document survives only in translation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the original text</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Jan Potocki?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polish aristocrat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language was The Saragossa Manuscript originally written in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When had Edmund Chojecki translated portions of the Saragossa Manuscript into Polish from French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1847</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What fragments were the complete Saragossa Manuscripts now produced based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French-language</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Translation has served as a school of writing for many authors.

Lasting effects on the religions, cultures and languages of their respective countries have been exerted by such Bible translations as Martin Luther's into German, Jakub Wujek's into Polish, and the King James Bible's translators' into English. Debate and religious schism over different translations of religious texts remain to this day, as demonstrated by, for example, the King James Only movement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During the Protestant Reformation, what local languages was the bible translated into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Biblical translations have caused lasting effects on what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religions, cultures and languages of their respective countries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Disparities between versions of crucial words and passages in versions of the bible contributed to what split?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Catholicism and Protestantism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the fact of the King James Only movement demonstrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">religious schism over different translations of religious texts remain to this day</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who translated the Bible to German?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Martin Luther</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
