In February 2003, planning for the Xenon software platform began, and was headed by Microsoft's Vice President J Allard. That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later. Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was because the system's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor. The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's Cell Processor PPE architecture. According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the IBM employees were &quot;hiding&quot; their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the Cell Processor. Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox 360.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Microsoft executive was in charge of 360 development?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">J Allard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What manufacturer was enlisted to design the 360's graphics processor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ATI</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Peter Moor work before being recruited to help on the 360?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sega of America</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Original 360 Alpha dev kits used what existing system's hardware?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apple's Power Mac G5</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What CPU did the 360 use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">IBM's Xenon processor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At launch, the Xbox 360 was available in two configurations: the &quot;Xbox 360&quot; package (unofficially known as the 20 GB Pro or Premium), priced at US$399 or GB£279.99, and the &quot;Xbox 360 Core&quot;, priced at US$299 and GB£209.99.

Xbox Live Free is included with all SKUs of the console. It allows users to create a user profile, join on message boards, and access Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members. A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming; however, some games that have rather limited online functions already, (such as Viva Piñata) or games that feature their own subscription service (e.g. EA Sports games) can be played with a Free account.

In addition to online multimedia features, the Xbox 360 allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera.

By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft. At the 2008 Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year. As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War, the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including Devil May Cry, Ace Combat, Virtua Fighter, Grand Theft Auto IV, Final Fantasy XIII, Tekken 6, Metal Gear Solid : Rising, and L.A. Noire. In addition, Xbox 360 versions of cross-platform games were generally considered superior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007, due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS3.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the software attach rate in the US for the 360 by March of 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7.5 games per console in the US</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two prominent 360 exclusive franchises?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Halo franchise and Gears of War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were early multi-platform games considered superior on the 360?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the difficulties of programming for the PS3</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The 360 earned 38 nominations and 12 wins from what organization in 2007?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Game Critics Awards</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Microsoft hoped to have how many titles available for the 360 by the end of 2008?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 1,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To aid customers with defective consoles, Microsoft extended the Xbox 360's manufacturer's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a &quot;General Hardware Failure&quot; error report.

Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it &quot;proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space&quot;. Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console. Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating &quot;It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's not about the exclusives—there's nothing to trump Naughty Dog's PS3 output, after all. Rather, it's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox's lifetime. The PC-like architecture meant those early EA Sports titles ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3, Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list, and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next-generation exclusive. And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 pad—another industry benchmark, and a critical one.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What online source called the 360 the 6th greatest console of all time in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">IGN</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">TechRadar honored the 360 by calling it what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">most influential</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What 360 peripheral was the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kinect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to PC Magazine, the 360 created the prototype for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">online gaming</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What magazine ranked the 360 as the second best console of the 1993-2013 period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edge</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360.

In addition to classic arcade games such as Ms. Pac-Man, the service offers some new original games like Assault Heroes. The Xbox Live Arcade also features games from other consoles, such as the PlayStation game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and PC games such as Zuma. The service was first launched on November 3, 2004, using a DVD to load, and offered games for about US$5 to $15. Items are purchased using Microsoft Points, a proprietary currency used to reduce credit card transaction charges. On November 22, 2005, Xbox Live Arcade was re-launched with the release of the Xbox 360, in which it was now integrated with the Xbox 360's dashboard.

In 2008, Gates and president of Entertainment &amp; Devices Robbie Bach announced a partnership with BT in the United Kingdom, in which the BT Vision advanced TV service, using the newer Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV platform, would be accessible via Xbox 360, planned for the middle of the year. BT Vision's DVR-based features would not be available on Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity. In 2010, while announcing version 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer mentioned that AT&amp;T's U-verse IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be used as set-top boxes later in the year.

Although not the best-selling console of its generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live. The Xbox 360's successor, the Xbox One, was released on November 22, 2013. Microsoft has stated they plan to support the Xbox 360 until 2016.
