Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines. Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What color are white grapes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">green</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What gene makes grapes purple?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">anthocyanins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What shape do grapes usually resemble?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prolate spheroid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of food are grapes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fruit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many grapes are generally in a cluster?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 to 300</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia. The oldest winery was found in Armenia, dating to around 4000 BC.[citation needed] By the 9th century AD the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.[citation needed] Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes,[citation needed] and history attests to the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for both eating and wine production[citation needed]. The growing of grapes would later spread to other regions in Europe, as well as North Africa, and eventually in North America.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long ago were grapes first cultivated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6,000–8,000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What microorganisms are naturally found on a grapes skin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yeast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the oldest know winery located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Armenia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city is Syrah red wine believed to have been named after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Shiraz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do we know that wine was made in ancient Egypt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hieroglyphics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Comparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that although the French tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of heart disease remains low in France.

The juice is often sold in stores or fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar. Grape juice that has been pasteurized, removing any naturally occurring yeast, will not ferment if kept sterile, and thus contains no alcohol. In the wine industry, grape juice that contains 7–23% of pulp, skins, stems and seeds is often referred to as &quot;must&quot;. In North America, the most common grape juice is purple and made from Concord grapes, while white grape juice is commonly made from Niagara grapes, both of which are varieties of native American grapes, a different species from European wine grapes. In California, Sultana (known there as Thompson Seedless) grapes are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What juice is made when grapes are crushed and blended?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grape juice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of grapes are made into vinegar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fermented</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common grape used to make juice in North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Concord grapes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Sultana grapes known as in California?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thompson Seedless</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of grapes are commonly used to make white grape juice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Niagara grapes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Red wine may offer health benefits more so than white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin, and only red wine is fermented with skins. The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol. By contrast, a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of wine is fermented with grape skin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">red wine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of wine is fermented after the grapes skin has been removed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">white wine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What substance is absorbed by wine when grapes are fermented with their skins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">resveratrol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of wine is believed to have more health benefits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Red wine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make wine (wine grapes). While almost all of them belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced &quot;100% grape juice&quot;, made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are grapes that are eaten raw classified as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">table grapes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are grapes that are used to make wine classified as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wine grapes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What specie are table grapes and wine grapes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vitis vinifera</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Classification of grapes are typically large and seedless?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Table grape</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of a wine grape is sugar when it is harvested?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">approximately 24%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Bible, grapes are first mentioned when Noah grows them on his farm (Genesis 9:20–21).

Deuteronomy 18:3–5,14:22–27,16:13–15 tell of the use of wine during Jewish feasts. Grapes were also significant to both the Greeks and Romans, and their god of agriculture, Dionysus, was linked to grapes and wine, being frequently portrayed with grape leaves on his head. Grapes are especially significant for Christians, who since the Early Church have used wine in their celebration of the Eucharist. Views on the significance of the wine vary between denominations. In Christian art, grapes often represent the blood of Christ, such as the grape leaves in Caravaggio’s John the Baptist.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When are grapes first mentioned in the Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genesis 9:20–21</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Greek and Roman god of agriculture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dionysus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose blood do grapes usually represent in Christian art?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christ</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which book of the Bible talks about the use of wine during Jewish feasts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Deuteronomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who in the Bible first grew grapes on their farm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Noah</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are several sources of the seedlessness trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: Thompson Seedless, Russian Seedless, and Black Monukka, all being cultivars of Vitis vinifera.

The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church (1983), Canon 924 says that the wine used must be natural, made from grapes of the vine, and not corrupt.
