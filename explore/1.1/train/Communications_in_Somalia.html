Telecommunications, internet, radio, print, television and postal services in the nation are largely concentrated in the private sector. Several of the telecom firms have begun expanding their activities abroad. The Federal government operates two official radio and television networks, which exist alongside a number of private and foreign stations. Print media in the country is also progressively giving way to news radio stations and online portals, as internet connectivity and access increases. Additionally, the national postal service is slated to be officially relaunched in 2013 after a long absence. In 2012, a National Communications Act was also approved by Cabinet members, which lays the foundation for the establishment of a National Communications regulator in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many official radio and television networks does the government of Somalia operate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are communication services in Somalia mainly located in the public or private sector?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">private</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As internet access increases, news media and online portals replace what form of media?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Print media</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the national postal service of Somalia relaunched?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2012, what act was approved to establish a National Communications regulator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">National Communications Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are communications services in Somalia mostly concentrated in the public or private sector?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">private</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Communications in Somalia are mostly concentrated in what sector?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">private</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many official rado iand TV networks does the governemt of Somalia run?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of media decreases and internet connectivity increases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Print media</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of media increases as internet connectivity and access increases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">radio stations and online portals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year is the postal service in Somalia set to relaunch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the start of the civil war, various new telecommunications companies began to spring up in the country and competed to provide missing infrastructure.

Prominent Somali telecommunications companies include Somtel Network, Golis Telecom Group, Hormuud Telecom, Somafone, Nationlink, Netco, Telcom and Somali Telecom Group. Hormuud Telecom alone grosses about $40 million a year.

According to Issa Farah, a former editor with the Dalka broadsheet, newspaper publishing in Somalia is likely to experience a resurgence if the National Somali Printing Press is re-opened and the sector is given adequate public support.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was The Mogadishu Times published?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mogadishu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did free media outlets begin to expand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Advertisers switched from print ads to what to reach more customers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">radio and online commercials</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whos is a former editor with The Delka Broadsheet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Issa Farah</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to the Centre for Law and Democracy (CLD) and the African Union/United Nations Information Support Team (IST), Somalia did not have systemic internet blocking or filtering as of December 2012.

Dial up internet services in Somalia were among the fastest growing on the continent, with an annual landline growth rate of over 12.5%. The increase in usage was largely due to innovative policy initiatives adopted by the various Somali telecom operators, including free local in-town calls, a flat rate of $10 per month for unlimited calls, a low charge of $0.005 per minute for Internet connections, and a one-time connection fee of $50. Global Internet Company, a firm jointly owned by the major Somali telecommunication networks Hormuud Telecom, Telcom Somalia and Nationlink, was the country's largest ISP. It was at the time the only provider of dial up services in Somalia's south-central regions. In the northern Puntland and Somaliland regions, online networks offered internet dial up services to their own group of subscribers. Among these firms was Golis Telecom Somalia in the northeast and Telesom in the northwest.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As of what year were dial up, wireless , and satellite services available?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the landline growth rate of Somalia in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12.5%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the flat rate per month for unlimited landline calls in Somalia in the year 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$10 per month</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Somalias largest ISP in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Global Internet Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the only provider of dial up service in Somalias SouthCentral regions in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Global Internet Company</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Broadband wireless services were offered by both dial up and non-dial up ISPs in major cities, such as Mogadishu, Bosaso, Hargeisa, Galkayo and Kismayo.

The local telecommunications company Dalkom Somalia provided internet over satellite, as well as premium routes for media operators and content providers, and international voice gateway services for global carriers. It also offered inexpensive bandwidth through its internet backbone, whereas bandwidth ordinarily cost customers from $2,500 to $3,000 per month through the major international bandwidth providers. The main clients of these local satellite services were internet cafes, money transfer firms and other companies, as well as international community representatives. In total, there were over 300 local satellite terminals available aross the nation, which were linked to teleports in Europe and Asia. Demand for the satellite services gradually began to fall as broadband wireless access rose.

The country previously had to rely on expensive satellite links due to the civil conflict, which limited internet usage. However, residents now have access to broadband internet cable for the first time after an agreement reached between Hormuud Telecom and Liquid Telecom. The deal will see Liquid Telecom link Hormuud to its 17,000 km (10,500 mile) network of terrestrial cables, which will deliver faster internet capacity. The fiber optic connection will also make online access more affordable to the average user. This in turn is expected to further increase the number of internet users. Dalkom Somalia reached a similar agreement with the West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC) Ltd, which it holds shares in. Effective the first quarter of 2014, the deal will establish fiber optic connectivity to and from Somalia via the EASSy cable. The new services are expected to reduce the cost of international bandwidth and to better optimize performance, thereby further broadening internet access. Dalkom Somalia is concurrently constructing a 1,000 square mile state-of-the-art data center in Mogadishu. The site will facilitate direct connection into the international fiber optic network by hosting equipment for all of the capital's ISPs and telecommunication companies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Somalia receive its first fiber optic connection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">in 2013, an agreement between Hormuud Telecom and Liquid Telecom provided residents access to what type of cable provider?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">broadband</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles long is Liquid Telecoms Network?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10,500 mile</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How will the fiber optic connection impact the price for online access for the average user?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more affordable</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Dalcom Somalia currently building a 1000 square mile data center?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mogadishu</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
