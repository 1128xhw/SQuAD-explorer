Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the first step in the human digestive system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the action of mastication (chewing)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is saliva?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a liquid secreted by the salivary glands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is in saliva that starts to digest the starches?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">salivary amylase</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the definition of bolus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a small, round slurry mass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the action of the food morving down the esophagus into the stomach called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peristalsis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours - eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage.

The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown.

The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are three digestions phases?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the cephalic phase occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are taste and smell stimuli sent to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long does the gastric phase take?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3 to 4 hours</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the gastric phase stimulated to start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In a channel transupport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria.

The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does digestion begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is food formed into before it is swallowed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a bolus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does food go after the esophagus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the stomach</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the action of food being moved into the stomach?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peristalsis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does gastric juice consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hydrochloric acid and pepsin</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose. Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine. Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods. This is commonly known as lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance varies widely by ethnic heritage; more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is lactase?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are lactoses component parts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glucose and galactose</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are glucose and galactose absorbed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small intestine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of the population are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Approximately 65 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is knon as when you are  unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lactose intolerance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After some time (typically 1–2 hours in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, 3–4 hours in house cats),[citation needed] the resulting thick liquid is called chyme. When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the resulting thick liquid called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chyme</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does chyme mix with in the duodenum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does hyme go after the duodenum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the small intestine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is chyme absorbed into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does 95% of absobtion of nutrients occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the small intestine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach.

The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens. For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin.
