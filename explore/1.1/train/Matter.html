This concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest, but this is ill-defined because an object's mass can arise from its (possibly massless) constituents' motion and interaction energies. Thus, matter does not have a universal definition, nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today. Matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century was the term matter defined excluding energy phenomena like light and sound?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is used for the substance that composes all observable physical objects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">matter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The mass of an object can come from the motion of its constituents or what other source?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">interaction energies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is used to describe the type of definition that matter would have if all scientists could agree on its definition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">universal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prior to the 20th century, the definition of matter included any object that had mass even when it was in what state? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at rest</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>All the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze are composed of atoms. This atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles—usually a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a cloud of orbiting electrons. Typically, science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume. By contrast, massless particles, such as photons, are not considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However, not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered &quot;point particles&quot; with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless, quarks and leptons together make up &quot;ordinary matter&quot;, and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of particles make up every object in the world that can be touched?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">atoms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The smaller particles that make up atoms, like protons and neutrons, are what kind of particles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">subatomic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What subatomic particle has no volume or rest mass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">photons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What  kind of particles are quarks and leptons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">point particles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Despite not having size or volume themselves, quarks and leptons contribute to what measure of composite particles in matter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">volume</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Matter commonly exists in four states (or phases): solid, liquid and gas, and plasma. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates. A focus on an elementary-particle view of matter also leads to new phases of matter, such as the quark–gluon plasma. For much of the history of the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called particulate theory of matter, was first put forward by the Greek philosophers Leucippus (~490 BC) and Democritus (~470–380 BC).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many phases of matter are there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">four</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What new phase of matter can be considered with a focus on elementary particles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quark–gluon plasma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the theory that matter is made up of discrete building blocks called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">particulate theory of matter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What colleague of Democritus, also a Greek philosopher, helped him propose the particulate theory of matter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Leucippus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">People have been wondering about the nature of matter for the entire history of what branch of science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">natural sciences</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Matter should not be confused with mass, as the two are not quite the same in modern physics. For example, mass is a conserved quantity, which means that its value is unchanging through time, within closed systems. However, matter is not conserved in such systems, although this is not obvious in ordinary conditions on Earth, where matter is approximately conserved. Still, special relativity shows that matter may disappear by conversion into energy, even inside closed systems, and it can also be created from energy, within such systems. However, because mass (like energy) can neither be created nor destroyed, the quantity of mass and the quantity of energy remain the same during a transformation of matter (which represents a certain amount of energy) into non-material (i.e., non-matter) energy. This is also true in the reverse transformation of energy into matter.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What similar term is often used interchangeably with matter, although the two differ slightly in modern physics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Being a conserved quantity means that the value of mass doesn't ever change as long as it's in what kind of system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">closed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Special relativity says matter can disappear by conversion into what state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">energy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What planet isn't a closed system but sometimes appears to be because of the approximate conservation of matter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Earth</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Different fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes incompatible, ways. Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter. As such, there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word &quot;matter&quot;. Scientifically, the term &quot;mass&quot; is well-defined, but &quot;matter&quot; is not. Sometimes in the field of physics &quot;matter&quot; is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both physics and chemistry, matter exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, the so-called wave–particle duality.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term does science not have a universally-accepted scientific definition for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">matter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sometimes scientific terms were historically considered in ways we know now aren't compatible because scientists didn't need to distinguish matter from what other term?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mass</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word do physicists sometimes consider to be defined as particles exhibiting rest mass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">matter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What duality describes the conflicting properties of matter in the fields of chemistry and physics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wave–particle duality</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Quarks and leptons are sometimes considered matter because they can't travel at what speed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the speed of light</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
