The largest group of mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables feeding the fetus during gestation.

Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and discard carbon dioxide.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When air enters both the oral and nasal cavities, where does it flow through?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">larynx, trachea and bronchi</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Increasing pressure on the diaphragm thus increasing air output more frequently is usually caused by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exercise</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A result of air being sucked into or blown out of the lung thats moving its pressure gradient is referred to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bellows lung</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the term Bellows Lung come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blacksmith's bellows</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer.

Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. However, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name used for mammalian hair?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pelage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which color of hair is most common among mammalian taxa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Light-dark color</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides Camouflage being a reason for having certain hair colors, what other reasons have been discovered? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most mammals are viviparous, giving birth to live young.

While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To be able to maintain a constant body temperature, what do mammals need to maintain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nutritious and plentiful diet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a omnivore imply?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eats both prey and plants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the majority of mammals under 18 oz eat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">insects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What determines a mammals diet type?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The size</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes. The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this. Other well known examples are the lion/tiger hybrid, the liger, which is by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses; and cattle hybrids such as between European and Indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and American bison, which are used in the meat industry and marketed as Beefalo. There is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species. Hybrid animals are normally infertile partly because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes, resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells, which prevents division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly, particularly in males. There are exceptions to this rule, especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species. Normally behavior traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation. However, the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity, cities, dumping grounds with food, agriculture, fencing, roads and so on do force animals together which would not normally breed. Clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf, coyote and domestic dog in North America. As many birds and mammals imprint on their mother and immediate family from infancy, a practice used by animal hybridizers is to foster a planned parent in a hybridization program with the same species as the one with which they are planned to mate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name given when zones of gradation exits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">clines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the given name of a lion and tiger hybrid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">liger</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the marketed name given in the meat industry when you involve a european or indian domestic cattle mixed with an American bison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Beefalo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the given name of a offspring from two different animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hybrid</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
