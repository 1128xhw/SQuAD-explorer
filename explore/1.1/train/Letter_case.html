(Informal communication, such as texting, instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note, may not bother, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal.) In English, capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a proper adjective. There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter. The names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first-person pronoun &quot;I&quot; and the interjection &quot;O&quot; (although the latter is uncommon in modern usage, with &quot;oh&quot; being preferred). Other words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and titles (see below). In some traditional forms of poetry, capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Capitalization in English is universally standardized for which type of writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In English the first letter of a sentence is which type of letter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capital</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is capitalization commonly use to indicate in poetry independent of any grammatical feature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">beginning of a line of verse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the first letter of a first-person pronoun handled mid sentence in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">capitalised</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The interjection &quot;O&quot; has been replaced by which more common and preferred word in English?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oh</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Originally alphabets were written entirely in majuscule letters, spaced between well-defined upper and lower bounds.

In mathematics, letter case may indicate the relationship between objects with uppercase letters often representing &quot;superior&quot; objects (e.g. X could be a set containing the generic member x).

Ritter's Oxford Manual of Style (2002) suggests capitalising &quot;the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, but generally not articles, conjunctions and short prepositions&quot;. This is an old form of emphasis, similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles.
