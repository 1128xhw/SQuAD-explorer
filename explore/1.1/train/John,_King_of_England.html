Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—Anjou, Normandy and England—and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers.[nb 2] The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was John born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24 December 1166</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Henry marry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eleanor of Aquitaine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Henry's ally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Holy Roman Emperor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1173 John's elder brothers, backed by Eleanor, rose in revolt against Henry in the short-lived rebellion of 1173 to 1174. Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense, Henry the Young King travelled to Paris and allied himself with Louis VII. Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join their brother Henry in Paris. Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at Montlouis. Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights, Richard was given Aquitaine back, and Geoffrey was allowed to return to Brittany; only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who backed John's elder brothers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eleanor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Henry travel to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who returned to Brittany?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geoffrey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was imprisoned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eleanor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After Richard's death on 6 April 1199 there were two potential claimants to the Angevin throne: John, whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II, and young Arthur I of Brittany, who held a claim as the son of John's elder brother Geoffrey. Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death, but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided. With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry's elder son, the matter rapidly became an open conflict. John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent. With Arthur's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip's forces moving down the valley towards Tours, John's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Richard die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 April 1199</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the sole surviving son?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was John crowned?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Westminster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose army pressed up the Loire valley?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arthur</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although John was the Count of Poitou and therefore the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – with the exception of Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Philip summon John to attend court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1202</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was John summoned as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Count of Poitou</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain. John's predecessors had ruled using the principle of vis et voluntas, or &quot;force and will&quot;, taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified on the basis that a king was above the law. Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of &quot;divine majesty&quot;; John continued this trend and claimed an &quot;almost imperial status&quot; for himself as ruler. During the 12th century, there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship, and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, and take counsel of the leading members of the realm. There was as yet no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so. Despite his claim to unique authority within England, John would sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons. Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of &quot;royal schizophrenia&quot; in his approach to government, or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What principle did John's predecessors use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vis et voluntas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What quality did Henry II and Richard possess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">divine majesty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century were there contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John suffer from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">royal schizophrenia</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the start of John's reign there was a sudden change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food resulted in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue for the rest of the 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened at the start of John's reign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sudden change in prices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the inflationary pressure continue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John address problems with the English currency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1204 and 1205</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did he address the problems with the English currency?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John, the youngest of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, was at first not expected to inherit significant lands. Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child. He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. John's elder brothers William, Henry and Geoffrey died young; by the time Richard I became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade. Despite this, after Richard died in 1199, John was proclaimed King of England, and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Henry's favorite child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was John appointed the Lord of Ireland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1177</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Richard I become king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1189</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The character of John's relationship with his second wife, Isabella of Angoulême, is unclear. John married Isabella whilst she was relatively young – her exact date of birth is uncertain, and estimates place her between at most 15 and more probably towards nine years old at the time of her marriage.[nb 15] Even by the standards of the time, Isabella was married whilst very young. John did not provide a great deal of money for his wife's household and did not pass on much of the revenue from her lands, to the extent that historian Nicholas Vincent has described him as being &quot;downright mean&quot; towards Isabella. Vincent concluded that the marriage was not a particularly &quot;amicable&quot; one. Other aspects of their marriage suggest a closer, more positive relationship. Chroniclers recorded that John had a &quot;mad infatuation&quot; with Isabella, and certainly John had conjugal relationships with Isabella between at least 1207 and 1215; they had five children. In contrast to Vincent, historian William Chester Jordan concludes that the pair were a &quot;companionable couple&quot; who had a successful marriage by the standards of the day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was John's second wife?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Isabella of Angoulême</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question"> Nicholas Vincent was described as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">downright mean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John have conjugal relationships with Isabella?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1207 and 1215</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many children did John and Isabella have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five children</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. John's judicial reforms had a lasting impact on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis of France. It soon descended into a stalemate. John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did war with France break out?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1202</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was John excommunicated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1209</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Magna Carta peace treaty agreed upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1215</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who won victory over Louis and the rebel barons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry III</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Baronial unrest in England prevented the departure of the planned 1205 expedition, and only a smaller force under William Longespée deployed to Poitou.

After a successful campaign against Alfonso, John headed north again, taking the city of Angers.

He enjoyed gambling, in particular at backgammon, and was an enthusiastic hunter, even by medieval standards. He liked music, although not songs. John would become a &quot;connoisseur of jewels&quot;, building up a large collection, and became famous for his opulent clothes and also, according to French chroniclers, for his fondness for bad wine. As John grew up, he became known for sometimes being &quot;genial, witty, generous and hospitable&quot;; at other moments, he could be jealous, over-sensitive and prone to fits of rage, &quot;biting and gnawing his fingers&quot; in anger.[nb 3]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How tall was John?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5 ft 5 in</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John build up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">travelling library of books</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became a connoisseur of jewels?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John do in fits of rage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">biting and gnawing his fingers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter, died on 13 July 1205, John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III that would lead to the king's excommunication. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being &quot;governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre&quot; and established &quot;its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler&quot;, in the words of historian Richard Huscroft. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome. These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. Pope Innocent was, according to historian Ralph Turner, an &quot;ambitious and aggressive&quot; religious leader, insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Hubert Walter die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13 July 1205</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What lead to the king's excommunication?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a dispute with Pope Innocent III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said Pope Innocent was an ambitious and aggressive religious leader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">historian Ralph Turner</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1185 John made his first visit to Ireland, accompanied by 300 knights and a team of administrators.

The war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation in England at the end of 1184.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Henry fight a short war with in 1183?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Henry the Young King die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dysentery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became the Duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the war end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1184</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Under mounting political pressure, John finally negotiated terms for a reconciliation, and the papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks (equivalent to £666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (£466) for England and 300 marks (£200) for Ireland, as well as recompensing the church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the Bulla Aurea, or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the compensation money he had promised the church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the papal terms for submission accepted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 1213</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many marks did John surrender?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the agreement formalised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bulla Aurea</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with Philip. He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John. John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered. John retreated to Normandy, where Richard finally found him later that year. Richard declared that his younger brother – despite being 27 years old – was merely &quot;a child who has had evil counsellors&quot; and forgave him, but removed his lands with the exception of Ireland.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did John explore an alliance with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French king Philip II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John do when Richard did not return from his crusade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">assert that his brother was dead</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who captured Richard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Duke of Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the king return to England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1194</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The political situation in England rapidly began to deteriorate. Longchamp refused to work with Puiset and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy. John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy to be portrayed as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king. Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp, and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London with John in control of the city of London, thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive. At this point Walter of Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, returned to England, having been sent by Richard to restore order. John's position was undermined by Walter's relative popularity and by the news that Richard had married whilst in Cyprus, which presented the possibility that Richard would have legitimate children and heirs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who refused to work with Puiset?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Longchamp</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Longchamp isolated in the Tower of London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 1191</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Walter of Coutances return to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Letters of support from the pope arrived in April but by then the rebel barons had organised.

John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from John's royalist faction.

It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.[nb 5]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the new peace last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was John's decision to marry Isabella?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 1200</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John acquired key land between Poitou and where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gascony</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After his coronation, John moved south into France with military forces and adopted a defensive posture along the eastern and southern Normandy borders. Both sides paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced; John's position was now stronger, thanks to confirmation that the counts Baldwin IX of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne had renewed the anti-French alliances they had previously agreed to with Richard. The powerful Anjou nobleman William des Roches was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John; suddenly the balance seemed to be tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John. Neither side was keen to continue the conflict, and following a papal truce the two leaders met in January 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace. From John's perspective, what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet; by this treaty, Philip recognised John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions, temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client, Arthur.[nb 4] John, in turn, abandoned Richard's former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and Boulogne, and accepted Philip's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of John's lands in France. John's policy earned him the disrespectful title of &quot;John Softsword&quot; from some English chroniclers, who contrasted his behaviour with his more aggressive brother, Richard.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John moved south into where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who renewed the anti-French alliances?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baldwin IX of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Treaty of Le Goulet negotiated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">May 1200</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What nickname did John's policy earn him?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Softsword</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The rebel barons responded by inviting the French prince Louis to lead them: Louis had a claim to the English throne by virtue of his marriage to Blanche of Castile, a granddaughter of Henry II.

Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause.

As the situation became worse for John, he appears to have decided to have Arthur killed, with the aim of removing his potential rival and of undermining the rebel movement in Brittany. Arthur had initially been imprisoned at Falaise and was then moved to Rouen. After this, Arthur's fate remains uncertain, but modern historians believe he was murdered by John. The annals of Margam Abbey suggest that &quot;John had captured Arthur and kept him alive in prison for some time in the castle of Rouen ... when John was drunk he slew Arthur with his own hand and tying a heavy stone to the body cast it into the Seine.&quot;[nb 7] Rumours of the manner of Arthur's death further reduced support for John across the region.

At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship, and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable. William de Roches and other of John's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose in fresh revolt. John's financial situation was tenuous: once factors such as the comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account, Philip enjoyed a considerable, although not overwhelming, advantage of resources over John.[nb 6]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What victory strengthened John's position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mirebeau</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who deserted John in favor of Philip?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William de Roches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was John's financial situation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tenuous</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the aftermath of John's death William Marshal was declared the protector of the nine-year-old Henry III.

The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or demesne; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord; and revenue from taxation. Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest. Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the scutage system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king. He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges. John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as &quot;avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded&quot;. John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of John's principal challenges?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">acquiring the large sums of money needed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Richard sell many royal properties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1189</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did John derive income from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fines, court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The administration of justice was of particular importance to John. Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II, including novel disseisin and mort d'ancestor. These processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases, which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords. John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs, and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194, creating a new class of borough coroners. John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, by fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself. John continued to try relatively minor cases, even during military crises. Viewed positively, Lewis Warren considers that John discharged &quot;his royal duty of providing justice ... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly endebted&quot;. Seen more critically, John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees, rather than a desire to deliver simple justice; John's legal system also only applied to free men, rather than to all of the population. Nonetheless, these changes were popular with many free tenants, who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons, against whom such cases were often brought. John's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves, especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was of particular importance to John?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">administration of justice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the system of coroners first introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1194</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was John motivated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">potential of the royal legal process to raise fees</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1940s, new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on research into the record evidence of his reign, such as pipe rolls, charters, court documents and similar primary records. Notably, an essay by Vivian Galbraith in 1945 proposed a &quot;new approach&quot; to understanding the ruler. The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians. Interpretations of Magna Carta and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between &quot;partisan&quot; factions. There has been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies. Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by Lewis Warren, suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did new interpretations of John's reign begin to emerge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1940s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote an essay in 1945 that proposed a &quot;new approach?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vivian Galbraith</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who suggested that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than previously supposed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lewis Warren</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John was deeply suspicious of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king.

The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, proved to be that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland. De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money, and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40,000 marks (equivalent to £26,666 at the time),[nb 13] his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John, which resulted in their deaths. De Braose died in exile in 1211, and his grandsons remained in prison until 1218.

In the Norman period, suffering the king's ill-will meant difficulties in obtaining grants, honours or petitions; Henry II had infamously expressed his fury and ill-will towards Thomas Becket; this ultimately resulted in Becket's death.

As an emergency measure, John recreated a version of Henry II's Assize of Arms of 1181, with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies. When the threat of invasion faded, John formed a large military force in England intended for Poitou, and a large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy. To achieve this, John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns, creating a more flexible system under which only one knight in ten would actually be mobilised, but would be financially supported by the other nine; knights would serve for an indefinite period. John built up a strong team of engineers for siege warfare and a substantial force of professional crossbowmen. The king was supported by a team of leading barons with military expertise, including William Longespée, William the Marshal, Roger de Lacy and, until he fell from favour, the marcher lord William de Braose.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John spent much of 1205 doing what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">securing England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John recreate a version of Henry II's Assize of Arms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1181</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many knights out of ten would be mobilised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the remainder of his reign, John focused on trying to retake Normandy. The available evidence suggests that John did not regard the loss of the Duchy as a permanent shift in Capetian power. Strategically, John faced several challenges: England itself had to be secured against possible French invasion, the sea-routes to Bordeaux needed to be secured following the loss of the land route to Aquitaine, and his remaining possessions in Aquitaine needed to be secured following the death of his mother, Eleanor, in April 1204. John's preferred plan was to use Poitou as a base of operations, advance up the Loire valley to threaten Paris, pin down the French forces and break Philip's internal lines of communication before landing a maritime force in the Duchy itself. Ideally, this plan would benefit from the opening of a second front on Philip's eastern frontiers with Flanders and Boulogne – effectively a re-creation of Richard's old strategy of applying pressure from Germany. All of this would require a great deal of money and soldiers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John focused on trying to retake what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Normandy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John did not regard the loss of Duchy as a permanent shift in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Capetian power</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was John's preferred plan?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">use Poitou as a base of operations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John remained Lord of Ireland throughout his reign. He drew on the country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased the size of his lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects that he might have done so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened. Simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for England.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John remained what throughout his reign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lord of Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the king cross into Ireland with a large army?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1210</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During Richard's rule, what did John successfully do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">increased the size of his lands in Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the late 12th and early 13th centuries the border and political relationship between England and Scotland was disputed, with the kings of Scotland claiming parts of what is now northern England. John's father, Henry II, had forced William the Lion to swear fealty to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174. This had been rescinded by Richard I in exchange for financial compensation in 1189, but the relationship remained uneasy. John began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties. He refused William's request for the earldom of Northumbria, but did not intervene in Scotland itself and focused on his continental problems. The two kings maintained a friendly relationship, meeting in 1206 and 1207, until it was rumoured in 1209 that William was intending to ally himself with Philip II of France. John invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the Treaty of Norham, which gave John control of William's daughters and required a payment of £10,000. This effectively crippled William's power north of the border, and by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals.[nb 16] John made no efforts to reinvigorate the Treaty of Falaise, though, and both William and Alexander remained independent kings, supported by, but not owing fealty to, John.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the political relationship between England and Scotland disputed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 12th and early 13th centuries</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who forced William the Lion to swear fealty to him?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John force William to sign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Treaty of Norham</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John treated the interdict as &quot;the equivalent of a papal declaration of war&quot;. He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to greatly worry the king. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks (equivalent to £66,666 at the time) to John. Official figures suggest that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John treated the interdict as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the equivalent of a papal declaration of war</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John seized the lands of who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">those clergy unwilling to conduct services</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Innocent excommunicate the king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 1209</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many marks did the church lose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">100,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John was incensed about what he perceived as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election.

He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place to try to convince John to change his mind, but to no avail.

The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king; left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to La Rochelle. Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy.

Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps.

The rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles that cut off the northern rebel barons from those in the south. John's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London, protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders, prevent the French from landing in the south-east, and then win the war through slow attrition. John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales, where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who made the first move in the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rebels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the rebels seize?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rochester Castle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who lead the rebellion against the 1211 settlement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Llywelyn the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was John's strategy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">isolate the rebel barons in London</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Neither John nor the rebel barons seriously attempted to implement the peace accord.

Despite his promises to the contrary, John appealed to Innocent for help, observing that the charter compromised the pope's rights under the 1213 agreement that had appointed him John's feudal lord.

Meanwhile, Alexander II invaded northern England again, taking Carlisle in August and then marching south to give homage to Prince Louis for his English possessions; John narrowly missed intercepting Alexander along the way.

Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer Howard Pyle's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional Robin Hood narrative. During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. Sam De Grasse's role as John in the black-and-white 1922 film version shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture. Claude Rains played John in the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn, starting a trend for films to depict John as an &quot;effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home&quot;. The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the Sheriff of Nottingham, who is usually the &quot;swashbuckling villain&quot; opposing Robin. An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version, for example, which depicts John, voiced by Peter Ustinov, as a &quot;cowardly, thumbsucking lion&quot;. Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as James Goldman's play and later film, The Lion in Winter, set in 1183, commonly present him as an &quot;effete weakling&quot;, in this instance contrasted with the more masculine Henry II, or as a tyrant, as in A.

Medieval chroniclers provided the first contemporary, or near contemporary, histories of John's reign. One group of chroniclers wrote early in John's life, or around the time of his accession, including Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto. These historians were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard's rule, but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John's reign. Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts; neither of them were positive about John's performance as king. Much of John's later, negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris, the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam in exchange for military aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad al-Nasir - a story which is considered to be untrue by modern historians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which historians wrote early in John's life?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did historians feel about John's behavior under Richard's rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unsympathetic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John attempted conversion of what in exchange for military aid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Islam</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period, mirroring the revisionist histories of the time. The anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John portrayed the king as a &quot;proto-Protestant martyr&quot;, similar to that shown in John Bale's morality play Kynge Johan, in which John attempts to save England from the &quot;evil agents of the Roman Church&quot;. By contrast, Shakespeare's King John, a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on The Troublesome Reign for its source material, offers a more &quot;balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler&quot;. Anthony Munday's play The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington portrays many of John's negative traits, but adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church, in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs. By the middle of the 17th century, plays such as Robert Davenport's King John and Matilda, although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did popular representations of John begin to emerge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tudor period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Anthony Munday's play?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In The Troublesome Reign of King John, John portrayed the king as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">proto-Protestant martyr</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards.

Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty. These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era, and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was critical of John's performance as king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Contemporary chroniclers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What historian summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John's positive qualities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jim Bradbury</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John remains a recurring character within what culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Western</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Henry II wanted to secure the southern borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy. As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piedmont, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert. For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes. Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation. Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Henry II wanted to secure the southern borders of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aquitaine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Alais?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What castles did Henry II transfer into John's name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For the remaining years of Richard's reign, John supported his brother on the continent, apparently loyally. Richard's policy on the continent was to attempt to regain through steady, limited campaigns the castles he had lost to Philip II whilst on crusade. He allied himself with the leaders of Flanders, Boulogne and the Holy Roman Empire to apply pressure on Philip from Germany. In 1195 John successfully conducted a sudden attack and siege of Évreux castle, and subsequently managed the defences of Normandy against Philip. The following year, John seized the town of Gamaches and led a raiding party within 50 miles (80 km) of Paris, capturing the Bishop of Beauvais. In return for this service, Richard withdrew his malevolentia (ill-will) towards John, restored him to the county of Gloucestershire and made him again the Count of Mortain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Richard withdrew what towards John?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">malevolentia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Count of Mortain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John successfully conduct a sudden attack and siege of Evreux castle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1195</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Unfortunately, Isabella was already engaged to Hugh of Lusignan, an important member of a key Poitou noble family and brother of Count Raoul of Eu, who possessed lands along the sensitive eastern Normandy border. Just as John stood to benefit strategically from marrying Isabella, so the marriage threatened the interests of the Lusignans, whose own lands currently provided the key route for royal goods and troops across Aquitaine. Rather than negotiating some form of compensation, John treated Hugh &quot;with contempt&quot;; this resulted in a Lusignan uprising that was promptly crushed by John, who also intervened to suppress Raoul in Normandy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Isabella engaged to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugh of Lusignan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hugh of Lusignan was an important member of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a key Poitou noble family</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John treated Hugh with what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">contempt</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John attempt to relieve in late 1203?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Château Gaillard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who blocked John's relief operation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip's forces</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Gaillard fall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">March 1204</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was John's only remaining possession on the Continent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Duchy of Aquitaine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony.[nb 11] The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; £44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders.[nb 12] John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown. John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did John levi scutage payments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eleven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John initiate a new round of appointments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1194</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were subject to huge taxes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John create a new tax on income and movable goods?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1207</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John's personal life greatly affected his reign. Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful and lacking in piety. It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses, but chroniclers complained that John's mistresses were married noblewomen, which was considered unacceptable. John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen. John's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear, however. None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point, although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period. The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.[nb 14]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many of John's mistresses were what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">married noblewomen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many children did John have with mistresses during his first marriage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">None</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John had already begun to improve his Channel forces before the loss of Normandy and he rapidly built up further maritime capabilities after its collapse.

By the end of 1204 he had around 50 large galleys available; another 54 vessels were built between 1209 and 1212. William of Wrotham was appointed &quot;keeper of the galleys&quot;, effectively John's chief admiral. Wrotham was responsible for fusing John's galleys, the ships of the Cinque Ports and pressed merchant vessels into a single operational fleet.

John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great. The king used the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers. A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through the Welsh uprising of 1211. John's invasion, striking into the Welsh heartlands, was a military success. Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit only temporarily.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did John visit every year between 1204 and 1211?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wales</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did John marry Joan to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Llywelyn the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John use to increase his own territory and power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">marcher lords and the native Welsh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did a royal expedition to enforce agreements occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1211</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Innocent gave some dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic communities were allowed to celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were Monastic communities allowed to celebrate Mass in private?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1209</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Holy Viaticum for the dying authorised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1212</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What threat was John worried about?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French invasion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Within a few months of John's return, rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule. John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring. John appears to have been playing for time until Pope Innocent III could send letters giving him explicit papal support. This was particularly important for John, as a way of pressuring the barons but also as a way of controlling Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the meantime, John began to recruit fresh mercenary forces from Poitou, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the king was escalating the conflict. John announced his intent to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did John hold a council in January 1215?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did John recruit mercenary forces from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Poitou</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John announced his intent to become what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a crusader</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John's campaign started well.

Having regained the south-east John split his forces, sending William Longespée to retake the north side of London and East Anglia, whilst John himself headed north via Nottingham to attack the estates of the northern barons. Both operations were successful and the majority of the remaining rebels were pinned down in London. In January 1216 John marched against Alexander II of Scotland, who had allied himself with the rebel cause.

Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life. John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by Ranulph Glanville, a leading English administrator.

Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and attempted to ensure that he would not face a revolt while away from his empire. John was made Count of Mortain, was married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade. Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power, and, for the time being, the king named the four-year-old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne. In return, John promised not to visit England for the next three years, thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the Levant without fear of John seizing power. Richard left political authority in England – the post of justiciar – jointly in the hands of Bishop Hugh de Puiset and William Mandeville, and made William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, his chancellor. Mandeville immediately died, and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset, which would prove to be a less than satisfactory partnership. Eleanor, the queen mother, convinced Richard to allow John into England in his absence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who took over as joint justiciar with Puiset after Mandeville died?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Longchamp</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who convinced Richard to allow John to join into England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eleanor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Richard become king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 1189</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Warfare in Normandy at the time was shaped by the defensive potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns. The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles, such as Château Gaillard, at strategic points, built and maintained at considerable expense. It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, which slowed the progress of any attack. Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces. Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of time before they returned home, forcing an end to a campaign; mercenary forces, often called Brabançons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could operate all year long and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces. As a result, commanders of the period were increasingly drawing on larger numbers of mercenaries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Warfare in Normandy was shaped by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">defensive potential of castles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were mercenary forces called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brabançons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What castle was built at a strategic point?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Château Gaillard</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John initially adopted a defensive posture similar to that of 1199: avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles. John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who accompanied John?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William de Roches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Philip forced to withdraw in the east?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">southern flank weakening</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was caught by surprised?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arthur</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household: the Chancery kept written records and communications; the Treasury and the Exchequer dealt with income and expenditure respectively; and various judges were deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom. Thanks to the efforts of men like Hubert Walter, this trend towards improved record keeping continued into his reign. Like previous kings, John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went. John was very active in the administration of England and was involved in every aspect of government. In part he was following in the tradition of Henry I and Henry II, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, which put much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style. John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors, which made his rule more personal than that of previous kings, particularly in previously ignored areas such as the north.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John inherit in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sophisticated system of administration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who dealt with income and expenditure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Treasury and the Exchequer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John followed in the tradition of who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Henry I and Henry II</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John's royal household was based around several groups of followers. One group was the familiares regis, John's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with him. They also played an important role in organising and leading military campaigns. Another section of royal followers were the curia regis; these curiales were the senior officials and agents of the king and were essential to his day-to-day rule. Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favours from the king, file lawsuits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one's debts remitted. By the time of Henry II, these posts were increasingly being filled by &quot;new men&quot; from outside the normal ranks of the barons. This intensified under John's rule, with many lesser nobles arriving from the continent to take up positions at court; many were mercenary leaders from Poitou. These men included soldiers who would become infamous in England for their uncivilised behaviour, including Falkes de Breauté, Geard d'Athies, Engelard de Cigongé and Philip Marc. Many barons perceived the king's household as what Ralph Turner has characterised as a &quot;narrow clique enjoying royal favour at barons' expense&quot; staffed by men of lesser status.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John's royal household was based around what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several groups of followers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the curia regis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">senior officials and agents of the king</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The mercenary leaders became infamous in England for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their uncivilised behaviour</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John's lack of religious conviction has been noted by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that John was at best impious, or even atheistic, a very serious issue at the time. Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion, his blasphemous remarks, and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including jokes about the implausibility of the Resurrection. They commented on the paucity of John's charitable donations to the church. Historian Frank McLynn argues that John's early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively advanced education, may have turned him against the church. Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John's personal interest in the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with Hugh of Lincoln, who was later declared a saint. Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances – albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance. The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was &quot;at least conventionally devout,&quot; citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Historians suspected that John was at best what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">impious</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was later declared a saint?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hugh of Lincoln</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Many records showed what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John's offerings to the poor</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the truce of 1206–1208, John focused on building up his financial and military resources in preparation for another attempt to recapture Normandy. John used some of this money to pay for new alliances on Philip's eastern frontiers, where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern France's neighbours. By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with his nephew Otto IV, a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, as well as with the counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders. The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou. Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his elder son, Louis, to invade Flanders with the intention of next launching an invasion of England. John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat. He launched his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme. The attack was a success, destroying Philip's vessels and any chances of an invasion of England that year. John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213, but baronial discontent again delayed his invasion plans until early 1214, in what would prove to be his final Continental campaign.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did John do during the truce of 1206-1208?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">focused on building up his financial and military resources</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By 1212, John had successfully concluded alliances  with who?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Otto IV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John launched his new fleet to attach the French where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the harbour of Damme</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John wanted John de Gray, the Bishop of Norwich and one of his own supporters, to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of Walter, but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral claimed the exclusive right to elect Walter's successor. They favoured Reginald, the chapter's sub-prior. To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop. The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent. John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de Gray, and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision. Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray, and instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton. John refused Innocent's request that he consent to Langton's appointment, but the pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did John want to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John de Gray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Innocent disavow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Reginald and John de Gray</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did John force to change their support to John de Gray?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canterbury chapter</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years, as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the king. Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as &quot;the Northerners&quot;. The northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in France, and many of them owed large sums of money to John; the revolt has been characterised as &quot;a rebellion of the king's debtors&quot;. Many of John's military household joined the rebels, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John. Tension also grew across North Wales, where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict. For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was an important factor, as he was considered an &quot;abrasive foreigner&quot; by many of the barons. The failure of John's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king; James Holt describes the path to civil war as &quot;direct, short and unavoidable&quot; following the defeat at Bouvines.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did many of the disaffected barons come from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">north of England</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was appointed justiciar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Peter des Roches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The failure of John's French military campaign</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>John met the rebel leaders at Runnymede, near Windsor Castle, on 15 June 1215. Langton's efforts at mediation created a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; it was later renamed Magna Carta, or &quot;Great Charter&quot;. The charter went beyond simply addressing specific baronial complaints, and formed a wider proposal for political reform, albeit one focusing on the rights of free men, not serfs and unfree labour. It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, new taxation only with baronial consent and limitations on scutage and other feudal payments. A council of twenty-five barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter, whilst the rebel army would stand down and London would be surrendered to the king.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did John meet the rebel leaders at Runnymede?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 June 1215</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A council of how many barons was created to monitor John's future adherence to the charter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twenty-five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The peace agreement was renamed what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Magna Carta</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prince Louis intended to land in the south of England in May 1216, and John assembled a naval force to intercept him.

Louis and the rebel barons advanced west and John retreated, spending the summer reorganising his defences across the rest of the kingdom.

John Gillingham, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren, and describes him &quot;one of the worst kings ever to rule England&quot;. Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults. Popular historian Frank McLynn maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, arguing that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is &quot;bizarre&quot;, and that as a monarch John &quot;fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What biographers argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Modern historians have been over lenient towards what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John's numerous faults</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">John Gillingham considers John what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a less effective general</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
