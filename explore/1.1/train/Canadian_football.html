The two sports have shared origins and are closely related but have significant differences. In particular, Canadian football has 12 players on the field per team rather than 11; the field is roughly 10 yards wider, and 10 yards longer between end-zones that are themselves 10 yards deeper; and a team has only three downs to gain 10 yards, which results in less offensive rushing than in the American game. In the Canadian game all players on the defending team, when a down begins, must be at least 1 yard from the line of scrimmage. (The American game has a similar &quot;neutral zone&quot; but it is only the length of the football.)</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which North American version of football calls for 12 player per side on the field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canadian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many yards wider is a Canadian football field than an American football field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which version of North American football has smaller end zones?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many downs does a team have to advance ten yards in Canadian football?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How far away from the line of scrimmage must Canadian football defenders be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1 yard</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Canadian football is also played at the high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the Canadian Junior Football League, formed May 8, 1974, and Quebec Junior Football League are leagues for players aged 18–22, many post-secondary institutions compete in Canadian Interuniversity Sport for the Vanier Cup, and senior leagues such as the Alberta Football League have grown in popularity in recent years.

Later both the Ontario and Quebec Rugby Football Union (ORFU and QRFU) were formed (January 1883), and then the Interprovincial (1907) and Western Interprovincial Football Union (1936) (IRFU and WIFU). The CRFU reorganized into an umbrella organization forming the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891. The original forerunners to the current Canadian Football League, was established in 1956 when the IRFU and WIFU formed an umbrella organization, The Canadian Football Council (CFC).

The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side, introduced the Snap-Back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the Throw-In from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks. The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country. The CIRFU, QRFU and CRU refused to adopt the new rules at first. Forward passes were not allowed in the Canadian game until 1929, and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes. The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was not based on American rules, as the Canadian game played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Canadian football rules did the ORFU adopt in 1903?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burnside</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which three Canadian football unions resisted the Burnside Rules?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CIRFU, QRFU and CRU</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did forward passes become acceptable in Canadian football?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1929</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which style of North American football changed the rules of their game the most from their earliest versions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Grey Cup was established in 1909 after being donated by Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, The Governor General of Canada as the championship of teams under the CRU for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada.

The move was aborted after three years; the Baltimore Stallions were the most successful of the numerous Americans teams to play in the CFL, winning the 83rd Grey Cup. Continuing financial losses, a lack of proper Canadian football venues, a pervasive belief that the American teams were simply pawns to provide the struggling Canadian teams with expansion fee revenue, and the return of the NFL to Baltimore prompted the end of Canadian football on the American side of the border.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which one country besides Canada has hosted a professional Canadian football game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the CFL first attempt an expansion into the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1992</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which American CFL team won the Grey Cup?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baltimore Stallions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The return of an NFL team to which city contributed to the demise of the CFL's American expansion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baltimore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many years did the CFL South Division last?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Amateur football is governed by Football Canada.

At each goal line is a set of 40-foot-high (12 m) goalposts, which consist of two uprights joined by an 18 1⁄2-foot-long (5.6 m) crossbar which is 10 feet (3 m) above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts 10 feet (3 m) above the ground) is preferred. The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every 5 yards (4.6 m) from the goal line. These lateral lines are called &quot;yard lines&quot; and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. In previous decades, arrows were not used and every yard line was usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with a &quot;0&quot;; in most stadiums today, the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-yard lines are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a &quot;G&quot;. The centre (55-yard) line usually is marked with a &quot;C&quot;. &quot;Hash marks&quot; are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at 1 yard (0.9 m) intervals, 24 yards (21.9 m) from the sidelines. On fields that have a surrounding running track, such as Commonwealth Stadium, Molson Stadium, and many universities, the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. In 2014, Edmonton placed turf over the track to create full end zones. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL's American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many yards wide is a Canadian football field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">65</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long in meters is the crossbar of a Canadian football goal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5.6</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of a Canadian football field was sometimes marked with a &quot;G&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">goal line</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What distance from the sidelines are hash marks painted on a CFL field?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24 yards (21.9 m)</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the beginning of a match, an official tosses a coin and allows the captain of the visiting team call heads or tails.

The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for a completed play?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">down</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many plays can the offence run without gaining ten yards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does a team do when they have not advance the ball enough to score or likely gain a new set of downs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">punt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many downs does a team get after they've gained ten on their first down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of 5 yards (4.6 m) in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for the player that is currently handing the football when play is underway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ball carrier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Within what distance from the line of scrimmage can offensive players who do not have the ball be legally contacted by defensive players?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one yard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two illegal ways to block an opposing player's progress near the line of scrimmage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hold or trip</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which player may not be tackled immediately after they have thrown a pass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">quarterback</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Infractions of the rules are punished with penalties, typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as offside (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations of the rules (such as face-masking) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, from where the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the usual penalty when the rules of play are violated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">loss of yardage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many yards does a team lose when they commit a minor penalty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many yards does a team lose for face-masking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other than yardage is sometimes awarded the offence on a defensive penalty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">first down</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Penalties never result in a score for the offence.

For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line).

If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a 2-point conversion. The other team then scrimmages the ball at the same 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff or championship game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What determines which team gets possession first when extending a game to break a tie?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coin toss</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At which yard line on their opponent's side does a team take possession of the ball according to the CFL's tie-breaking rules?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the CFL begin requiring teams to attempt 2-point conversions after scoring in a tie-breaking situation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2010</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which round of tie-breaking is the last possible round in a regular season CFL game?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which CFL games require tie-breaking rounds continue until a winner results?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">playoff or championship</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
