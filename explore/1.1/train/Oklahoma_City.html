The county seat of Oklahoma County, the city ranks 27th among United States cities in population. The population grew following the 2010 Census, with the population estimated to have increased to 620,602 as of July 2014. As of 2014, the Oklahoma City metropolitan area had a population of 1,322,429, and the Oklahoma City-Shawnee Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1,459,758 (Chamber of Commerce) residents, making it Oklahoma's largest metropolitan area. Oklahoma City's city limits extend into Canadian, Cleveland, and Pottawatomie counties, though much of those areas outside of the core Oklahoma County area are suburban or rural (watershed). The city ranks as the eighth-largest city in the United States by land area (including consolidated city-counties; it is the largest city in the United States by land area whose government is not consolidated with that of a county or borough).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the capital of Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oklahoma City</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city is the largest in Oklahoma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oklahoma City</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of Oklahoma city in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,322,429</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Oklahoma City, lying in the Great Plains region, features one of the largest livestock markets in the world.

The main transfer terminal is located downtown at NW 5th Street and Hudson Avenue. METRO Transit maintains limited coverage of the city's main street grid using a hub-and-spoke system from the main terminal, making many journeys impractical due to the rather small number of bus routes offered and that most trips require a transfer downtown. The city has recognized that transit as a major issue for the rapidly growing and urbanizing city and has initiated several studies in recent times to improve upon the existing bus system starting with a plan known as the Fixed Guideway Study. This study identified several potential commuter transit routes from the suburbs into downtown OKC as well as feeder-line bus and/or rail routes throughout the city.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Oklahoma Cities transit company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">METRO Transit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the plan that is being made to enhance the bus system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fixed Guideway Study</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On December 2009, Oklahoma City voters passed MAPS 3, the $777 million (7-year 1-cent tax) initiative, which will include funding (appx $130M) for an estimated 5-to-6-mile (8.0 to 9.7 km) modern streetcar in downtown Oklahoma City and the establishment of a transit hub.
