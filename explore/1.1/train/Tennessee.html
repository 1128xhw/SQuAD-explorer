Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 601,222.

Beginning during Reconstruction, it had competitive party politics, but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century. In the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, aided by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority and, in the early 1940s, the city of Oak Ridge. This city was established to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities, helping to build the world's first atomic bomb, which was used during World War II.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part dominated Tennessee's politics in the late 1880s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Democratic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Tennessee city was received significant federal investment in the 1940s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oak Ridge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the Manhattan Project did Tennessee host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">uranium enrichment facilities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What made Tennessee politics more competitive again in the middle of the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">civil rights legislation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music, including rock and roll, blues, country, and rockabilly.[not verified in body] Beale Street in Memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues, with musicians such as W.C.

The state averages around 50 days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large hail and damaging winds. Tornadoes are possible throughout the state, with West and Middle Tennessee the most vulnerable. Occasionally, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating April 2011 tornadoes that killed 20 people in North Georgia and Southeast Tennessee. On average, the state has 15 tornadoes per year. Tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes which have fatalities. Winter storms are an occasional problem, such as the infamous Blizzard of 1993, although ice storms are a more likely occurrence.

Thousands of former slaves ended up fighting on the Union side, nearly 200,000 in total across the South.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which forces controlled most of Tennessee when slaves were emancipated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Up to how many former slaves began fighting with for the Union after the Emancipation Proclamation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">200,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which edict freed slaves across most of the Confederacy, but technically not Tennessee?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emancipation Proclamation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1864, Andrew Johnson (a War Democrat from Tennessee) was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln.

Through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their allies, White Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other states across the South in the late 1870s and 1880s. Over the next decade, the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control African Americans. In 1889 the General Assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform, with the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most African Americans in rural areas and small towns, as well as many poor Whites. Legislation included implementation of a poll tax, timing of registration, and recording requirements. Tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades into the 20th century. Disfranchising legislation accompanied Jim Crow laws passed in the late 19th century, which imposed segregation in the state. In 1900, African Americans made up nearly 24% of the state's population, and numbered 480,430 citizens who lived mostly in the central and western parts of the state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were targeted by restrictive laws passed in Southern states at the end of the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">African Americans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the Tennessee General Assembly pass electoral reform laws that disenfranchised most African Americans in the state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1889</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who besides African Americans were victims of Tennessee's late-19th century electoral reform?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poor Whites</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name for laws dating from the late-19th century which promoted segregation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jim Crow laws</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many African Americans lived in Tennessee in 1900?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">480,430</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2002, businessman Phil Bredesen was elected as the 48th governor.

Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics. But in the 1880s, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in the Republican Party, the state, and cities where they had significant population was markedly reduced. In 1900 African Americans comprised 23.8 percent of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and West Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of commission government for cities based on at-large voting for a few positions on a Board of Commission; several adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation. In 1913 the state legislature enacted a bill enabling cities to adopt this structure without legislative approval.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party did most former slaves join when they were given the right to vote after the Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Republican</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which decade did the Tennessee legislature institute a poll tax?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1880s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party declined in Tennessee politics following voting reform legislation during Reconstruction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Republican</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the Tennessee population was African-American in 1900?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">23.8</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1913, the Tennessee state legislature made which organizational structure the default form of city government in the state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Board of Commission</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After disenfranchisement of blacks, the GOP in Tennessee was historically a sectional party supported by whites only in the eastern part of the state.

Harding over Ohio Governor James Cox, and in 1928, when it more decisively voted for Herbert Hoover over New York Governor Al Smith, a Catholic), the state was part of the Democratic Solid South until the 1950s. In that postwar decade, it twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during World War II.

The latter area includes a large African-American population. Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s. Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since. The 1st has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans (or their antecedents) have held it for all but four years since 1859.

It also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties. This case arose out of a lawsuit challenging the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature. After decades in which urban populations had been underrepresented in many state legislatures, this significant ruling led to an increased (and proportional) prominence in state politics by urban and, eventually, suburban, legislators and statewide officeholders in relation to their population within the state.
