The far East, a phrase containing a noun, East, qualified by an adjective, far, could be at any location in the &quot;far east&quot; of the speaker's home territory. The Ottoman Empire, for example, was the far East as much as the East Indies. The Crimean War brought a change in vocabulary with the introduction of terms more familiar to the late 19th century. The Russian Empire had entered a more aggressive phase, becoming militarily active against the Ottoman Empire and also against China, with territorial aggrandizement explicitly in mind. Rethinking its policy the British government decided that the two polities under attack were necessary for the balance of power. It therefore undertook to oppose the Russians in both places, one result being the Crimean War. During that war the administration of the British Empire began promulgating a new vocabulary, giving specific regional meaning to &quot;the Near East,&quot; the Ottoman Empire, and &quot;the Far East,&quot; the East Indies.

The difference was the Hamidian Massacres, which were being conducted even as the couple traveled the Balkans.

Archaeology on the international scene, although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities, fell into the shadow of international relations. Their domain became the Ancient Near East, which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East. The Ottoman Empire was gone, along with all the other empires of the 19th century, replaced with independent republics. Someone had to reconcile the present with the past. This duty was inherited by various specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of international relations, now so complex as to be beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense. The ancient Near East is frozen in time. The living Near East is primarily what the agencies say it is.

It appears to have multiple leadership. On the one hand its director is appointed by the president. It plays a significant role in providing the president with intelligence. On the other hand, Congress oversees its operations through a committee. The CIA was first formed under the National Security Act of 1947 from the army's Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which furnished both military intelligence and clandestine military operations to the army during the crisis of World War II. Many revisions and redefinitions have taken place since then. Although the name of the CIA reflects the original advised intent of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, the government's needs for strategic services have frustrated that intent from the beginning. The press received by the agency in countless articles, novels and other media have tended to create various popular myths; for example, that this agency replaced any intelligence effort other than that of the OSS, or that it contains the central intelligence capability of the United States. Strategic services are officially provided by some 17 agencies called the Intelligence Community. Army intelligence did not come to an end; in fact, all the branches of the Armed Forces retained their intelligence services. This community is currently under the leadership (in addition to all its other leadership) of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a quasi-independent agency of the United States Government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The CIA appears to have what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">multiple leadership</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who appoints the director of the CIA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the president</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who oversees the operations of the CIA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Congress</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Under these complex circumstances regional names are less useful.
