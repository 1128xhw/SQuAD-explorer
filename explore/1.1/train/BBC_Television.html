This system used a vertically-scanned image of 30 lines â€“ just enough resolution for a close-up of one person, and with a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters. Simultaneous transmission of sound and picture was achieved on 30 March 1930, by using the BBC's new twin transmitter at Brookmans Park. By late 1930, 30 minutes of morning programmes were broadcast Monday to Friday, and 30 minutes at midnight on Tuesdays and Fridays, after BBC radio went off the air.

Regularly scheduled electronically scanned television began from Alexandra Palace in London on 2 November 1936, to just a few hundred viewers in the immediate area. The first programme broadcast â€“ and thus the first ever, on a dedicated TV channel â€“ was &quot;Opening of the BBC Television Service&quot; at 15:00. The first major outside broadcast was the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937. The service was reaching an estimated 25,000â€“40,000 homes before the outbreak of World War II which caused the service to be suspended in September 1939. The VHF broadcasts would have provided an ideal radio beacon for German bombers homing in on London, and the engineers and technicians of the service would be needed for the war effort, in particular the radar programme.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the BBC's transmitter located in 1930?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brookmans Park</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the BBC start broadcasting under the name BBC One?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2 August 1932</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of the first show seen on the BBC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Opening of the BBC Television Service</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which members of British royalty were seen on the BBC in May of 1937?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the BBC cease broadcasts due to World War II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 1939</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared war on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning; the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft homing in on London.
