The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for &quot;vacant&quot; or &quot;void&quot;. An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call &quot;vacuum&quot; or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure. The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The word Vacuum stems from what Latin adjective?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vacuus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the term used by Physicists, partial vacuum, refer to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">imperfect vacuum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a vacuum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">space void of matter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of pressure is less than atmospheric pressure in a vacuum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gaseous</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Latin term is used to describe an object in a vacuum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in vacuo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. Other things equal, lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum. For example, a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 20%. Much higher-quality vacuums are possible. Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10−12) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm3. Outer space is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average. According to modern understanding, even if all matter could be removed from a volume, it would still not be &quot;empty&quot; due to vacuum fluctuations, dark energy, transiting gamma rays, cosmic rays, neutrinos, and other phenomena in quantum physics. In the electromagnetism in the 19th century, vacuum was thought to be filled with a medium called aether.

Ancient Greek philosophers debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of atomism, which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. Following Plato, even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by the senses, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which cannot rightly be said to exist. Aristotle believed that no void could occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Aristotle believe about a void?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no void could occur naturally,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was historically disputed about vacuums?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">whether such a thing as a vacuum can exist.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did something that was literally nothing at all,According to Plato, mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cannot rightly be said to exist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aristotle thought what would fill any rarity that might give rise to a void?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">denser surrounding material continuum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In his Physics, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ad infinitum, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular.

Eventually following Stoic physics in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a supernatural void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did believes start to move away from Aristotle's idea regarding a void?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What thought process was used in the beginning belief of the existence of vacuums?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Stoic physics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Roger Bacon,Walter Burley and Blasius of Parma were from what century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">13th and 14th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What belief regarding a cosmic void was accepted by most in the 17th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a supernatural void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself.

By the ancient definition however, directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinct. With the acquiescence of Cartesian mechanical philosophy to the &quot;brute fact&quot; of action at a distance, and at length, its successful reification by force fields and ever more sophisticated geometric structure, the anachronism of empty space widened until &quot;a seething ferment&quot; of quantum activity in the 20th century filled the vacuum with a virtual pleroma.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Descartes believe about vacuums in nature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">that a vacuum does not occur in nature</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose work with metaphysics would come to define the notion of empty space?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Descartes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What philosophy combined with Descartes to push quantum activity in the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cartesian mechanical philosophy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1930, Paul Dirac proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the Dirac sea.

However, according to Nader El-Bizri, the physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1039) and the Mu'tazili theologians disagreed with Aristotle and Al-Farabi, and they supported the existence of a void. Using geometry, Ibn al-Haytham mathematically demonstrated that place (al-makan) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body. According to Ahmad Dallal, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī also states that &quot;there is no observable evidence that rules out the possibility of vacuum&quot;.

The commonly held view that nature abhorred a vacuum was called horror vacui. Speculation that even God could not create a vacuum if he wanted to was shut down[clarification needed] by the 1277 Paris condemnations of Bishop Etienne Tempier, which required there to be no restrictions on the powers of God, which led to the conclusion that God could create a vacuum if he so wished.

Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected.

Vacuum is primarily measured by its absolute pressure, but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as temperature and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the mean free path (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of fluid mechanics do not apply. This vacuum state is called high vacuum, and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70 nm, but at 100 mPa (~6997100000000000000♠1×10−3 Torr) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as vacuum tubes.

A torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury (mmHg) in a manometer with 1 torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the barometric scale or as a percentage of atmospheric pressure in bars or atmospheres.

The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is mercury the better option for liquid used in a Hydrostatic gauge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">its high density and low vapour pressure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a vertical column of liquid in a tube which has different pressures at each end called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hydrostatic gauges</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a hydrostatic gauge used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the McLeod gauge special?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">An indirect measurement of pressure is most often calibrated by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">McLeod gauge</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Thermal conductivity gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure.

The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits.

Although the blood will not boil, the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures, known as ebullism, is still a concern. The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a flight suit.

Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging.

Pumping systems differ in oil contamination, vibration, preferential pumping of certain gases, pump-down speeds, intermittent duty cycle, reliability, or tolerance to high leakage rates.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When multiple pumps are connected in series to produce higher vacuum it is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">stages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The choice of seals, or chamber geometry ,for example impact a pump.
