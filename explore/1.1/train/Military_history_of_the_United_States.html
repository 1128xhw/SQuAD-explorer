With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the biggest war the US got involved with in the early 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the War of 1812</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What conflict caused Britain to blockade trade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a major war with Napoleon's France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What uprising did Britain support in North America?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian insurrection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country was the first the US ever declared war upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the initial US strategy in the War of 1812?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Secretary of War Elihu Root (1899–1904) led the modernization of the Army.

Miles but did succeed in enlarging West Point and establishing the U.S. Army War College as well as the General Staff. Root changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the Army's role in governing the new territories acquired in 1898 and worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, and wrote the charter of government for the Philippines.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Secretary of War who modernized the US military at the beginning of the 20th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elihu Root</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which military academy did Root help grow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">West Point</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What military advisement committee was established by Root?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Staff</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What officer rotation doctrine was developed under Root's guidance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the principle of rotating officers from staff to line</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What then-US protectorate did Root write a government charter for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Philippines</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The United States originally wished to remain neutral when World War I broke out in August 1914. However, it insisted on its right as a neutral party to immunity from German submarine attack, even though its ships carried food and raw materials to Britain. In 1917 the Germans resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to American entry. When the U.S declared war, the U.S. army was still small by European standards and mobilization would take a year. Meanwhile, the U.S. continued to provide supplies and money to Britain and France, and initiated the first peacetime draft. Industrial mobilization took longer than expected, so divisions were sent to Europe without equipment, relying instead on the British and French to supply them.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When World War I started, what was the official US position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neutral</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did World War I commence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What German war policy precipitated US involvement in WWI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">submarine attacks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the US enter World War I?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1917</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The United States built its army prior to joining the war in what way?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peacetime draft</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in American politics. One side views the war as a necessary part of the Containment policy, which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare. Others note the U.S. made major strategic gains as the Communists were defeated in Indonesia, and by 1972 both Moscow and Beijing were competing for American support, at the expense of their allies in Hanoi. Critics see the conflict as a &quot;quagmire&quot;—an endless waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern US interests. Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since. The draft became extremely unpopular, and President Nixon ended it in 1973, forcing the military (the Army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers. That raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall American society and values; the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best American values.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Vietnam War was an element of what US diplomatic policy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Containment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Communists were defeated in what country in 1972?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indonesia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term did critics of the Vietnam War use to describe it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a &quot;quagmire&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the draft end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1973</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which president ended the draft?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1973</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Persian Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States. The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as &quot;permanently disabled&quot; according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome). The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia. Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many nations were against Iraq in the US-led coalition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">34</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What precipitated the Persian Gulf War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did this precipitating event take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did hostilities in the Persian Gulf War begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many US veterans of the Persian Gulf War have been classed as permanently disabled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">180,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>US troops participated in a UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia beginning in 1992. By 1993 the US troops were augmented with Rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from Pakistan. During a raid in downtown Mogadishu, US troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the Battle of Mogadishu. Eighteen American soldiers were killed, and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob. Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000 total casualties during the conflict. After much public disapproval, American forces were quickly withdrawn by President Bill Clinton. The incident profoundly affected US thinking about peacekeeping and intervention. The book Black Hawk Down was written about the battle, and was the basis for the later movie of the same name.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what African country did US troops participate in peacekeeping operations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Somalia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Somalian warlord who directed massacres of peacekeeping troops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mohamed Farrah Aidid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what Somalian city did American troops become trapped?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mogadishu</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many US soldiers were killed in the battle of Mogadishu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eighteen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the title of the book and movie about the Mogadishu uprising?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Black Hawk Down</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In January 2002, the U.S. sent more than 1,200 troops (later raised to 2,000) to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating terrorist groups linked to al-Qaida, such as Abu Sayyaf, under Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines.

With the coming in 1777 of General von Steuben, the training and discipline along Prussian lines began, and the Continental Army began to evolve into a modern force.

The Army performed well in combat in Cuba. However, it was too oriented to small posts in the West and not as well-prepared for an overseas conflict. It relied on volunteers and state militia units, which faced logistical, training and food problems in the staging areas in Florida. The United States freed Cuba (after an occupation by the U.S. Army). By the peace treaty Spain ceded to the United States its colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.

The U.S. Navy now had a major forward presence across the Pacific and (with the lease of Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba) a major base in the Caribbean guarding the approaches to the Gulf Coast and the Panama Canal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the American army fight the Spanish in the Spanish American War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cuba</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The army in this war was primarily made up of what sort of units?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">volunteers and state militia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What colonies did Spain hand over to the US after the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What island territory voluntarily joined the US as a colony in 1898?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hawaii</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the naval base the US leased from a newly independent Cuba?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Guantánamo Bay Naval Base</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Philippine–American War (1899–1902) was an armed conflict between a group of Filipino revolutionaries and the American forces following the ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila. The Army sent in 100,000 soldiers (mostly from the National Guard) under General Elwell Otis. Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899, the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands. The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies.

The Navy and Marine Corps followed this up with an island hopping campaign across the central and south Pacific in 1943–45, reaching the outskirts of Japan in the Battle of Okinawa. During 1942 and 1943, the U.S. deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the UK, beginning with the strategic bombing of Nazi Germany and occupied Europe and leading up to the Allied invasions of occupied North Africa in November 1942, Sicily and Italy in 1943, France in 1944, and the invasion of Germany in 1945, parallel with the Soviet invasion from the east. That led to the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945. In the Pacific, the U.S. experienced much success in naval campaigns during 1944, but bloody battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945 led the U.S. to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of American lives. The U.S. used atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to destroy the Japanese war effort and to shock the Japanese leadership, which quickly caused the surrender of Japan.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many battleships did the US Navy lose at Pearl Harbor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eight</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Americans were killed during the Pearl Harbor attack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2,403</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term describes the overall US strategy in the Pacific in WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">island hopping</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Allies invade North Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1942</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two Japanese cities were hit with atomic bombs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hiroshima and Nagasaki</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Korean War was a conflict between the United States and its United Nations allies and the communist powers under influence of the Soviet Union (also a UN member nation) and the People's Republic of China (which later also gained UN membership).

North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did North Korean forces initiate attacks on US and UN forces in the Korean war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1950</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What South Korean city did the US and ROK forces defend while building reinforcements?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pusan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of attack was used on Inchon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">amphibious invasion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Chinese troops attacked the UN forces when they crossed what river? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Yalu River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What general was fired for defying President Truman's containment strategy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Douglas MacArthur</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam or the &quot;RVN&quot;), the United States, supplemented by South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics. There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a &quot;turkey shoot&quot;. The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main reason the US-led coalition won a decisive victory in the Persian Gulf War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">US technological superiority</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">US airstrikes on Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities began when?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on 17 January 1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What faults in the Iraqi forces led to their rapid defeat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ordered Iraqi forces to hold their ground despite air bombardments?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iraqi President Saddam Hussein</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did US ground forces attack Iraqi positions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24 February</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After just 100 hours of ground combat, and with all of Kuwait and much of southern Iraq under coalition control, US President George H.

His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.

In early 1916 Pancho Villa a Mexican general ordered 500 soldiers on a murderous raid on the American city of Columbus New Mexico, with the goal of robbing banks to fund his army. The German Secret Service encouraged Pancho Villa in his attacks to involve the United States in an intervention in Mexico which would distract the United States from its growing involvement in the war and divert aid from Europe to support the intervention. Wilson called up the state militias (National Guard) and sent them and the U.S. Army under General John J. Pershing to punish Villa in the Pancho Villa Expedition. Villa fled, with the Americans in pursuit deep into Mexico, thereby arousing Mexican nationalism.

After nearly 50 years of proxy wars, and constant fears of another war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, some thought the Persian Gulf War might finally answer the question of which military philosophy would have reigned supreme. Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of war with Iran, and they were well equipped with late model Soviet tanks and jet fighters, but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled; in comparison, the US had no large-scale combat experience since its withdrawal from Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier, and major changes in US doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What conflict was supposed to have provided Iraqi forces with battle experience?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">8 years of war with Iran</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some observers thought that the Persian Gulf War would have tank battles similar to what war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Africa during World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What equipment did the Iraqi army possess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late model Soviet tanks and jet fighters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prior to the Persian Gulf War, where and when was the last major American military conflict?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What problem did the Iraqi forces have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the antiaircraft weapons were crippled</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the emergence of ISIL and its capture of large areas of Iraq and Syria, a number of crises resulted that sparked international attention. ISIL had perpetrated sectarian killings and war crimes in both Iraq and Syria. Gains made in the Iraq war were rolled back as Iraqi army units abandoned their posts. Cities were taken over by the terrorist group which enforced its brand of Sharia law. The kidnapping and decapitation of numerous Western journalists and aid-workers also garnered interest and outrage among Western powers. The US intervened with airstrikes in Iraq over ISIL held territories and assets in August, and in September a coalition of US and Middle Eastern powers initiated a bombing campaign in Syria aimed at degrading and destroying ISIL and Al-Nusra-held territory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization captured significant segments of Iraq and Syria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ISIL</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What legal ethos does ISIL operate under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sharia law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What actions did ISIL take against Western journalists and aid workers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kidnapping and decapitation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the US intervene against ISIL?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">airstrikes in Iraq over ISIL held territories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the goal of US and coalition airstrikes in Syria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">degrading and destroying ISIL and Al-Nusra-held territory</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
