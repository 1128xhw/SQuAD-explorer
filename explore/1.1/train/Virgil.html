Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists. Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers. Macrobius says that Virgil's father was of a humble background; however, scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education. He attended schools in Cremona, Mediolanum, Rome and Naples. After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law, the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which village does tradition believe Virgil was born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Andes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which cities did Virgil attend schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cremona, Mediolanum, Rome and Naples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other career did Virgil consider?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rhetoric and law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of family do scholars generally believe Virgil belonged to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">equestrian landowning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does Macrobius believe Virgil's father came from a distinguished or humble background?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humble</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to the commentators, Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to Cremona, Milan, and finally Rome to study rhetoric, medicine, and astronomy, which he soon abandoned for philosophy. From Virgil's admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna, it has been inferred that he was, for a time, associated with Catullus' neoteric circle. However schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved, according to Servius, and he was nicknamed &quot;Parthenias&quot; or &quot;maiden&quot; because of his social aloofness. Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid. According to the Catalepton, while in the Epicurean school of Siro the Epicurean at Naples, he began to write poetry. A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title Appendix Vergiliana, but are largely considered spurious by scholars. One, the Catalepton, consists of fourteen short poems, some of which may be Virgil's, and another, a short narrative poem titled the Culex (&quot;The Gnat&quot;), was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which three studies did Virgil abandon for philosophy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rhetoric, medicine, and astronomy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was Virgil regarded socially by his schoolmates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">extremely shy and reserved</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Virgil's nickname?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parthenias</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did Virgil earn his nickname &quot;Parthenias&quot; or &quot;maiden&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social aloofness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which short narrative poem was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Culex</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues (or Bucolics) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC, although this is controversial. The Eclogues (from the Greek for &quot;selections&quot;) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (&quot;pastoral poetry&quot;) of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called &quot;Messianic Eclogue&quot; uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Virgil is credited[by whom?] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus, and later writers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Hellenistic poet was known for bucolic hexameter poetry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Theocritus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to pay off veterans with land, some of which possibly belonged to Virgil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Octavian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Virgil's loss of his famiyl farm and the attempt to regain his property though poetry was the inferred motive for which work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eclogues</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom was Eclogue 4 addressed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Asinius Pollio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Eclogues discusses homosexual love?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ecl. 2</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues (probably before 37 BC), Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas, Octavian's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian's side.

The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm. In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the didactic (&quot;how to&quot;) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets. The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees (1 and 2), livestock and horses (3), and beekeeping and the qualities of bees (4). Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld. Ancient scholars, such as Servius, conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section in praise of Virgil's friend, the poet Gallus, who was disgraced by Augustus, and who committed suicide in 26 BC.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which long didactic hexameter poem did Virgil work on for several years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Georgics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To whom was Georgics dedicated to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maecenas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The theme of Georgics is instruction in the methods of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">running a farm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Virgil's poet friends committed suicide in 26 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gallus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Gallus disgraced by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Augustus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Georgics' tone wavers between optimism and pessimism, sparking critical debate on the poet's intentions, but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry.

Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life (29–19 BC), commissioned, according to Propertius, by Augustus. The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas, a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy, to Italy, his battle with the Italian prince Turnus, and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge. The Aeneid's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome. Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic; Homer, the preeminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes. Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry. Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Virgil's works is widely considered his finest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Aeneid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commissioned the Aeneid according to Propertius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Augustus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many books are included in The Aeneid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">12</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Homer's works did the first six books of the Aeneid model after?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Odyssey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Homer's works did the last six books of the Aeneid connect to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Iliad</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Book 1 (at the head of the Odyssean section) opens with a storm which Juno, Aeneas' enemy throughout the poem, stirs up against the fleet. The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which historically was Rome's deadliest foe. The queen, Dido, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. In Book 5, Aeneas' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him. On reaching Cumae, in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl, who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome's destiny to his son.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Aeneas' enemy throughout the Aeneid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Juno</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which queen committed suicide in Book 4 of the Aeneid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dido</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which book does Aeneas' father die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who reveals Rome's destiny to Aeneas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anchises</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who guides Aeneas through the Underworld?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sibyl</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Book 7 (beginning the Iliadic half) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas' arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus.

In Book 8, Aeneas allies with King Evander, who occupies the future site of Rome, and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history. Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians, Book 10, the death of Evander's young son Pallas, and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus. The Aeneid ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus' city, the death of Amata, and Aeneas' defeat and killing of Turnus, whose pleas for mercy are spurned.

The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The Aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the &quot;pious&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot; Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Augustus' victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Ceopatra VII occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">31 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the protagonist of the Aeneid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aeneas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is mercilessly slaughtered by Aeneas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turnus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the founder of Rome which some scholars see strong associations with Aeneas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Augustus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Aeneid appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4, and 6 to Augustus; and Book 6 apparently caused Augustus' sister Octavia to faint.

After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara. After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21, 19 BC. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard Virgil's own wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible. As a result, the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e. not a complete line of dactylic hexameter). Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect. Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to tradition, where did Virgil travel in 19 BC to revise the Aeneid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greece</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Virgil die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brundisium harbor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What date did Virgil die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 21, 19 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were Virgil's literary executors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What wish of Virgil's did Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca disregard?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the poem be burned</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called &quot;mini-Aeneid&quot;, has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to &quot;rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.&quot; In Silius Italicus, Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Virgil's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called &quot;Messianic&quot; Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Virgil also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was one of Virgil's most ardent admirers who referenced Virgil in almost every line of his epic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Silius Italicus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">.What was the title of Silius Italicus' epic in which Virgil was referenced in almost every line?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Punica</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bought Virgil's tomb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Silius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which of Virgil's works was later widely interpreted to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fourth Eclogue</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet.

Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years, arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves.

She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house, which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window. When he did so he was only hoisted halfway up the wall and then left him trapped there into the next day, exposed to public ridicule. The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle.

Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration. One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo (&quot;maiden&quot; in Latin) due to Virgil's excessive, &quot;maiden&quot;-like modesty. Alternatively, some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga (&quot;wand&quot;) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages (this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts, however, and was probably not widespread). In Norman schools (following the French practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence Virgil. In the 19th century, some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil, as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling.[citation needed] Modern usage permits both, though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus. Some post-Renaissance writers liked to affect the sobriquet &quot;The Swan of Mantua&quot;.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides Virgilius, which other spelling is permitted in modern usage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vergilius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which time period was Vergilius spelled Virgilius?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Late Empire and Middle Ages</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did some German-trained classicists in the US suggest modifying the common usage to Vergil?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which style guide recommends using Vergilius to avoid confusion with Virgilius Maro Grammaticus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Oxford</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
