Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the &quot;donor&quot; organism(s).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must a species do in order to be classified as a predator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">direct impact on the prey population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How would you describe a predator that primarily eats plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">herbivory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A predator must do what to the prey after it is killed? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A species that uses a host body to survive and reproduce is classified as a what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parasitic species</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How would you describe a diet of a species that eats primarily dead organic material? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">detritivory</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does an herbivore eat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do detritivores have a direct impact on &quot;donor&quot; organisms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">no</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is given to an organism that is being hunted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is given to the biological interaction where a predator feeds upon prey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">predation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the key characteristic of predation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the predator's direct impact on the prey population</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do detritivores eat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dead organic material</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the key characteristic of predation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">predator's direct impact on the prey population</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Classification of predators by the extent to which they feed on and interact with their prey is one way ecologists may wish to categorize the different types of predation. Instead of focusing on what they eat, this system classifies predators by the way in which they eat, and the general nature of the interaction between predator and prey species. Two factors are considered here: How close the predator and prey are (in the latter two cases the term prey may be replaced with host) and whether or not the prey are directly murdered by the predator is considered, with true predation and parasitoidism involving certain death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many synergetic qualities are there in the predator-prey mechanism? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Two factors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Proximity and the ending of life is called? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">true predation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If the prey is not killed the predator-prey interaction is called? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parasitoidism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of what predators eat, how else can they be classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the way in which they eat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Certain death is involved with true predation and what other classification?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parasitoidism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The study in which ecologists examine the way predators interact with their prey is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">predation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do household animals prey upon? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large and small prey</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name an exemplar of an predator that uses digestion to kill and gain nutrients from it's prey.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Baleen whales</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To be classified as a predator, what action must be performed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">harm their prey in some way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What requirement must a true predator fulfill?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kills and eats another living thing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is different about a true predator?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">All types of predators do what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">harm their prey in some way</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do ambush predators hunt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do box jellyfish use to hunt their pray?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">venom</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Grazing organisms may also kill their prey species, but this is seldom the case. While some herbivores like zooplankton live on unicellular phytoplankton and therefore, by the individualized nature of the organism, kill their prey, many only eat a small part of the plant. Grazing livestock may pull some grass out at the roots, but most is simply grazed upon, allowing the plant to regrow once again. Kelp is frequently grazed in subtidal kelp forests, but regrows at the base of the blade continuously to cope with browsing pressure. Animals may also be 'grazed' upon; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring. Starfish may be grazed on, being capable of regenerating lost arms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Animals that consume parts of their prey are considered to be</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grazing organisms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prey that can regrow leaves or arms have learned to deal with what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">browsing pressure</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Give an example of a predator that specializes in eating autotrophic species</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">zooplankton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Give an example of an animal that feeds off of other animals for reproduction? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mosquitos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an organism that grazes upon other animals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">female mosquitos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an organism that can regrow lost arms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Starfish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do grazing organisms often kill their prey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seldom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do grass and kelp deal with being grazed upon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">regrows at the base</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Parasites can at times be difficult to distinguish from grazers. Their feeding behavior is similar in many ways, however they are noted for their close association with their host species. While a grazing species such as an elephant may travel many kilometers in a single day, grazing on many plants in the process, parasites form very close associations with their hosts, usually having only one or at most a few in their lifetime. This close living arrangement may be described by the term symbiosis, &quot;living together&quot;, but unlike mutualism the association significantly reduces the fitness of the host. Parasitic organisms range from the macroscopic mistletoe, a parasitic plant, to microscopic internal parasites such as cholera. Some species however have more loose associations with their hosts. Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) larvae may feed parasitically on only a single plant, or they may graze on several nearby plants. It is therefore wise to treat this classification system as a continuum rather than four isolated forms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Species that rely on few or a single prey are called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parasites</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Predator and prey relationships that improve fitness for both species are classified as this type of relationship.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mutualism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Give an example of an animal that will travel several miles in a single day.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elephant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What plant associated with kissing during the holidays is also parasitic? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mistletoe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are parasites distiguished from grazers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">close association with their host species</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many hosts do parasites typically have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one or at most a few in their lifetime</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How should parasite classification be viewed instead of as four isolated forms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a continuum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the term symbiosis mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">living together</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Parasitoids are organisms living in or on their host and feeding directly upon it, eventually leading to its death. They are much like parasites in their close symbiotic relationship with their host or hosts. Like the previous two classifications parasitoid predators do not kill their hosts instantly. However, unlike parasites, they are very similar to true predators in that the fate of their prey is quite inevitably death. A well-known example of a parasitoids are the ichneumon wasps, solitary insects living a free life as an adult, then laying eggs on or in another species such as a caterpillar. Its larva(e) feed on the growing host causing it little harm at first, but soon devouring the internal organs until finally destroying the nervous system resulting in prey death. By this stage the young wasp(s) are developed sufficiently to move to the next stage in their life cycle. Though limited mainly to the insect order Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera parasitoids make up as much as 10% of all insect species.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">This species relies on other species to provide a reproductive host for their offspring.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ichneumon wasps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">It is believed that parasitoids account for what percentage of the total insect population? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During a parasitoid-host interaction what will happen to the host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">death</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term given to organisms living and feeding on their host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parasitoids</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many organisms in the insect species are Diptera or Cleoptera parasitoids?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of wasp is a well-known example of a parasitoid?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ichneumon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do the larvae of the parasitoid wasps kill their prey?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">devouring the internal organs until finally destroying the nervous system</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Among predators there is a large degree of specialization. Many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey. Others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything (examples: humans, leopards, dogs and alligators). The specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey. The prey in turn, are often equally suited to escape that predator. This is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium. Some predators specialize in certain classes of prey, not just single species. Some will switch to other prey (with varying degrees of success) when the preferred target is extremely scarce, and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Species that aren't considered specialized are called what? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">opportunistic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Predator and prey interactions that involve specialization result in a balance called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">equilibrium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When a specialized species resorts to foraging and eating other diets, it's like because it's primary food source is?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scarce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do specialized predators and prey rely on to get the upper hand? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some predators that will kill and eat nearly anything?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humans, leopards, dogs and alligators</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is used for predators and prey being well suited to hunt and evade each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">evolutionary arms race</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of an evolutionary arms race?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">keep the populations of both species in equilibrium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If scavengers' food becomes scarce, they may turn to what type of diet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">herbivorous</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top of any food chain (that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism) is called an apex predator; examples include the orca, sperm whale, anaconda, Komodo dragon, tiger, lion, tiger shark, Nile crocodile, and most eagles and owls—and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears. An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a dog among alligators, a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray, or a snapping turtle among jaguars; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the the strata of predator prey interaction called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trophic level</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the top predator in an environment called? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">apex predator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When a new apex predator moves into an area this changes. </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trophic pyramid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What limits the size of a trophic pyramid? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">energy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which organisms are known as primary consumers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Organisms that feed on autotrophs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes an organism a secondary consumer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">feed on heterotrophs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an organism at the top of the food chain called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">apex predator</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many levels does a predatory pyramid or heirarchy typically climb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five or six levels</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what pyramid position is an organism not preyed upon by any other predators?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the top</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many organisms (of which humans are prime examples) eat from multiple levels of the food chain and, thus, make this classification problematic. A carnivore may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers, and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons. Organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory are known as omnivores.

At least a few people, such as the Donner party, are said to have resorted to it in desperation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What physical disadvantages do humans have against other apex predators?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">speed, bone density, weight, and physical strength</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how long have humans been using stone tools and weapons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">well over a million years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are humans' primary competitors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">other humans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one known istance of cannibalism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Donner party</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what species do humans hunt in partnership?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">domestic dog</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Having small population size is a characteristic almost universally inherent to apex predators, humans and dogs by far the most blatant exceptions. Low numbers wouldn't be a problem for apex predators if there was an abundance of prey and no competition or niche overlap, a scenario that is rarely, if ever, encountered in the wild. The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species' ecological niches overlap, there is a very high likelihood of competition as both species are in direct competition for the same resources. This factor alone could lead to the extirpation of one or both species, but is compounded by the added factor of prey abundance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two apex predators do not have a small population size?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humans and dogs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do apex predators generally have a large or small population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">small</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which principle states that if two species ecologicl niches/ overlap, both species are likely to be in competition with one another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">competitive exclusion principle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other factor is relevant to the competitive exclusion principle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prey abundance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A predator's effect on its prey species is hard to see in the short-term. However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When a predator hunts too much of its prey, causing both populations to dissappear, the phenomenon is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coextinction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are predator's effects on prey easiest to see in the short-term or long-term?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">longer period of time</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The rise and fall of predator and prey populations are similar to what, in the US economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">boom and bust cycle of economics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Predators may be put to use in conservation efforts to control introduced species. Although the aim in this situation is to remove the introduced species entirely, keeping its abundance down is often the only possibility. Predators from its natural range may be introduced to control populations, though in some cases this has little effect, and may even cause unforeseen problems. Besides their use in conservation biology, predators are also important for controlling pests in agriculture. Natural predators are an environmentally friendly and sustainable way of reducing damage to crops, and are one alternative to the use of chemical agents such as pesticides.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How can natural predators benefit crops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reducing damage to crops, and are one alternative to the use of chemical agents such as pesticides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are predators beneficial to agriculture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">controlling pests</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If removing an introduced species entirely isn't a posibility, what is the next best outcome?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">keeping its abundance down</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Predators are used in conservation to reduce what type of species from the environment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">introduced species</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
