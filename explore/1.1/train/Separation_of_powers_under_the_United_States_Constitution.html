Each of the three branches would have defined abilities to check the powers of the other branches. This idea was called separation of powers. This philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. This United States form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which political practice did Montesquieu originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Separation of powers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many divisions of the government did Montesquieu call for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What document was greatly informed by the idea of separation of powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United States Constitution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of oversight does the separation of powers help to promote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">checks and balances</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the doctrine called that allowed the three branches of government to check the powers of each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">separation of powers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as John Locke advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it.

The executive branch acted in the name of the King (&quot;His Majesty's Government&quot;), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government &quot;separate and distinct.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country's government, on which the US government was modeled, did not formally implement separation of powers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">UK</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the two main principles informing the government of the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term describes the status of the different branches of government in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">separate and distinct</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country's government served as a model for the United States Government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 18th century what function, besides President, did the Delaware President serve? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a member of the Court of Appeals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Congress has the sole power to legislate for the United States.

Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between &quot;important&quot; subjects and mere details.

This procedure is an integral part of the constitutional design for the separation of powers. Further rulings clarified the case; even both Houses acting together cannot override Executive vetos without a 2⁄3 majority.

It was Andrew Jackson, the seventh President, who was the first to use the veto as a political weapon.

Some believed that the president would become a mere figurehead, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives becoming a de facto Prime Minister. Grover Cleveland, the first Democratic President following Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office. During his first term, he vetoed over four hundred bills—twice as many bills as his twenty-one predecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed as a result of the patronage system, replacing them with more &quot;deserving&quot; individuals. The Senate, however, refused to confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland steadfastly refused, asserting, &quot;These suspensions are my executive acts ... I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions to them for judgment.&quot; Cleveland's popular support forced the Senate to back down and confirm the nominees. Furthermore, Congress finally repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act that had been passed during the Johnson Administration. Overall, this meant that Cleveland's Administration marked the end of presidential subordination.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first president to veto over 400 bills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grover Cleveland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under which President was the Tenure of Office Act repealed? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Grover Cleveland</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Several twentieth-century presidents have attempted to greatly expand the power of the presidency.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt held considerable power during the Great Depression. Congress had granted Franklin Roosevelt sweeping authority; in Panama Refining v. Ryan, the Court for the first time struck down a Congressional delegation of power as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers. The aforementioned Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, another separation of powers case, was also decided during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency. In response to many unfavorable Supreme Court decisions, Roosevelt introduced a &quot;Court Packing&quot; plan, under which more seats would be added to the Supreme Court for the president to fill.

Nixon also asserted that &quot;executive privilege&quot; shielded him from all legislative oversight; furthermore, he impounded federal funds (that is to say, he refused to spend money that Congress had appropriated for government programs). In the specific cases aforementioned, however, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon. This was also because of an ongoing criminal investigation into the Watergate tapes, even though they acknowledged the general need for executive privilege. Since then, Nixon's successors have sometimes asserted that they may act in the interests of national security or that executive privilege shields them from Congressional oversight. Though such claims have in general been more limited than Nixon's, one may still conclude that the presidency's power has been greatly augmented since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under what basis did Richard Nixon assert an expansion of the power of the President?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">national security</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It is said[by whom?] on one side of this debate that separation of powers means that powers are shared among different branches; no one branch may act unilaterally on issues (other than perhaps minor questions), but must obtain some form of agreement across branches.
