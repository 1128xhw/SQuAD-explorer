Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw it in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain. Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, such as telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows such as the Eurovision Song Contest), the drama of backstories and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time. The show debuted in 2001 in Britain with Lythgoe as showrunner‍—‌the executive producer and production leader‍—‌and Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was a big success with the viewing public.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What show in New Zealand was the inspiration for the British Series Pop Idol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Popstars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the creator of British Series Pop Idol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Simon Fuller</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Pop Idol make its television debut?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a judge on the British series Pop Idol in 2001?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Simon Cowell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Wha was the executive producer of Pop Idol in 2001?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nigel Lythgoe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What show was Pop Idols based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Popstars</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who saw Popstars while in Australia and wanted Britain to have the same thing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nigel Lythgoe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to back stories and drama, what did Fuller add to the show?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">telephone voting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Pop Idol premiere in Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the executive producer of Pop Idol?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lythgoe</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States, but the idea was met with poor response from United States television networks. However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was persuaded to buy the show by his daughter Elisabeth, who was a fan of the British show. The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job as showrunner but refused; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to Cowell's surprise, it became one of the hit shows for the summer that year. The show, with the personal engagement of the viewers with the contestants through voting, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge, grew into a phenomenon. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show in the U.S., a position it then held on for seven consecutive seasons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how many seasons was American Idol the most watched show in the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did American Idol first air on FOX?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2002</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did producers attempt to sell the Pop Idol format in the United States? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who talked Rupert Murdoch into buying American Idol for FOX?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his daughter Elisabeth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the head of Fox's parent company?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rupert Murdoch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Pop Idol renamed to for its American debut?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American Idol: The Search for a Superstar</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The show had originally planned on having four judges following the Pop Idol format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.

Season six was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which season premier of American Idol was the most watched?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Season six</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which season to American Idols rating begin to fall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Season six</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did other television networks refer to American Idol as because of its ratings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Death Star</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which television network originally aired The Cosby Show? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">NBC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which season premiere was the most watched of all seasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Season six</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the show called by other networks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Death Star</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Season six saw what for the first time in viewership?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">decline</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Season six was the first season where what had more viewers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">results show</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The loss of viewers continued into season seven.

It was also described as a &quot;sadistic musical bake-off&quot;, and &quot;a romp in humiliation&quot;. Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations – Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is &quot;a conniving multimedia monster&quot; that has &quot;absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil&quot;.

Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol &quot;isn't really about music.

LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that &quot;Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award&quot;. It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others.

In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the Idol set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real Idol judges, critiqued the performances. Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a &quot;finals&quot; show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner. The winner of the finals show received a &quot;Dream Ticket&quot; that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future American Idol audition. The attraction closed on August 30, 2014.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company has a them park attraction known as The American Idol Experience? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Walt Disney Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did The Walt Disney Company open The American Idol Experience? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did The Walt Disney Company close The American Idol Experience? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2014</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company had a partnership with The Walt Disney Company for The American Idol Experience? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19 Entertainment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the American Idol Experience open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 14, 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did it open?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Walt Disney World</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the winner win?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dream Ticket</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Experience close?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 30, 2014</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>American Idol is broadcast to over 100 nations outside of the United States.
