The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,123 ft), known as the &quot;four-thousanders&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Country are the Alps located in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many kilometres do the Alps stretch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,200 kilometres</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long has it taken for the Alps to form? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over tens of millions of years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the highest mountain in the Alps?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mont Blanc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Alpine region is also known as what? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the &quot;four-thousanders&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones.

The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the formation of the alps began?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">about 300 million years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of what during the Paleozoic Era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a single tectonic plate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the single tectonic plate break into separate plates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Mesozoic Era</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Tethys sea developed during what period of time? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jurassic Period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The collision between the African and the Eurasian plates began during what time? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the late Cretaceous Period</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Under extreme compressive stresses and pressure, marine sedimentary rocks were uplifted, creating characteristic recumbent folds, or nappes, and thrust faults.

The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.

Born in Geneva, Saussure was enamored with the mountains from an early age; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland, the Savoy, the Piedmont and Valais, studying the glaciers and the geology, as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval. Saussure, in 1787, was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc—today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Conrad Gessner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Horace-Benedict de Saussure born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geneva</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Saussure</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons.

Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in The Prelude. Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence.

Most of Europe's highest railways are located there. Moreover, plans are underway to build a 57 km (35 mi)-long sub-alpine tunnel connecting the older Lötschberg and Gotthard tunnels built in the 19th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much area is devoted to roads in the Alpine region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4,200 km (2,600 mi)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many vehicles use the roads? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are most of Europe's highest railways located? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Switzerland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is the tunnel connecting Lotschberg and Gotthard planned to be? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">57 km</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some high mountain villages, such as Avoriaz (in France), Wengen, and Zermatt (in Switzerland) are accessible only by cable car or cog-rail trains, and are car free.
