The island is under the jurisdiction of the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which has led to doubts about the finality of the Commonwealth status for Puerto Rico. In addition, all people born in Puerto Rico become citizens of the U.S. at birth (under provisions of the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917), but citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote for president nor for full members of either house of Congress. Statehood would grant island residents full voting rights at the Federal level.

It would have provided for a federally sanctioned self-determination process for the people of Puerto Rico. This act would provide for referendums to be held in Puerto Rico to determine the island's ultimate political status.

In Federalist No. 43 of The Federalist Papers, James Madison considered the implications of the definition of the &quot;seat of government&quot; found in the United States Constitution. Although he noted potential conflicts of interest, and the need for a &quot;municipal legislature for local purposes,&quot; Madison did not address the district's role in national voting. Legal scholars disagree on whether a simple act of Congress can admit the District as a state, due to its status as the seat of government of the United States, which Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution requires to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress; depending on the interpretation of this text, admission of the full District as a state may require a Constitutional amendment, which is much more difficult to enact. However, the Constitution does not set a minimum size for the District. Its size has already changed once before, when Virginia reclaimed the portion of the District south of the Potomac. So the constitutional requirement for a federal district can be satisfied by reducing its size to the small central core of government buildings and monuments, giving the rest of the territory to the new state.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who considered the implications of the definition of the seat of government in the Constitution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Madison</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are these ideas located in the Federalist Papers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federalist No. 43</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What limits does the constitution have for the size of Washington, D.C.?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Constitution does not set a minimum size for the District</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the size of Washington, D.C. to change?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Virginia reclaimed the portion of the District south of the Potomac</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Washington, D.C. residents who support the statehood movement sometimes use a shortened version of the Revolutionary War protest motto &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;, omitting the initial &quot;No&quot;, denoting their lack of Congressional representation; the phrase is now printed on newly issued Washington, D.C. license plates (although a driver may choose to have the Washington, D.C. website address instead).

The first invasion was during the Revolution, under the assumption that French-speaking Canadians' presumed hostility towards British colonial rule combined with the Franco-American alliance would make them natural allies to the American cause; the Continental Army successfully recruited two Canadian regiments for the invasion. That invasion's failure forced the members of those regiments into exile, and they settled mostly in upstate New York. The Articles of Confederation, written during the Revolution, included a provision for Canada to join the United States, should they ever decide to do so, without needing to seek U.S. permission as other states would. The United States again invaded Canada during the War of 1812, but this effort was made more difficult due to the large number of Loyalist Americans that had fled to what is now Ontario and still resisted joining the republic. The Hunter Patriots in the 1830s and the Fenian raids after the American Civil War were private attacks on Canada from the U.S. Several U.S. politicians in the 19th century also spoke in favour of annexing Canada.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Quebec land in British hands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1763</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Ontario land in British hands?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1763</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During which the US invade Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the War of 1812</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did several US politicians suggest doing in the 19th century?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">annexing Canada</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the late 1940s, during the last days of the Dominion of Newfoundland (at the time a dominion-dependency in the Commonwealth and independent of Canada), there was mainstream support, although not majority, for Newfoundland to form an economic union with the United States, thanks to the efforts of the Economic Union Party and significant U.S. investment in Newfoundland stemming from the U.S.-British alliance in World War II.

In 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100 million ($1.2 billion today) but Denmark refused to sell it. Several politicians and others have in recent years argued that Greenland could hypothetically be in a better financial situation as a part of the United States; for instance mentioned by professor Gudmundur Alfredsson at University of Akureyri in 2014. One of the actual reasons behind US interest in Greenland could be the vast natural resources of the island. According to Wikileaks, the U.S. appears to be highly interested in investing in the resource base of the island and in tapping the vast expected hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the US control Greenland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the US offer to pay for Greenland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">$100 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What university is professor Gudmundur Alfredssson from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Akureyri</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one reason the US would be interested in Greenland?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the vast expected hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Poland has historically been staunchly pro-American, dating back to General Tadeusz Kościuszko and Casimir Pulaski's involvement in the American Revolution.
