Highly sensitive films are correspondingly termed fast films. In both digital and film photography, the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality (via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types). In short, the higher the sensitivity, the grainier the image will be.

Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: lighting, film speed, f-number (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time). The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the APEX system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a &quot;stop&quot;. The effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2. Therefore, each f-number factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: f/1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the effective f-number proportional to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used to discover the right exposure parameters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Film speed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What variables help the photographer produce the desired effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lighting, film speed, f-number (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A lens with a setting of f/1.4 lets how much to hit the focal plane compared with a setting of f/2?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twice as much</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the APEX system, the increment that doubles the exposure is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;stop&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Upon exposure, the amount of light energy that reaches the film determines the effect upon the emulsion.

This rule is called reciprocity. The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds. In practice, reciprocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposures between 1/1000 second to 1/2 second.

Because the 1998 version of ISO 12232 did not permit measurement of camera output that had lossy compression, it was not possible to correctly apply any of those measurements to cameras that did not produce sRGB files in an uncompressed format such as TIFF. Following the publication of CIPA DC-004 in 2006, Japanese manufacturers of digital still cameras are required to specify whether a sensitivity rating is REI or SOS.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What measures might the user &quot;ISO&quot; setting correspond to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the noise-based speed, saturation-based speed, or the specified output sensitivity, or even some made-up number for marketing purposes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the 1998 version of ISO 12232 not permit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">measurement of camera output that had lossy compression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of sensitivity ratings can be specified by a camera?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">REI or SOS</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What standards changed what Japanese camera makers have to specify?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">CIPA DC-004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was CIPA DC-004 introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
