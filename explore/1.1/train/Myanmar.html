In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and, following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty, the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony. Myanmar became an independent nation in 1948, initially as a democratic nation and then, following a coup d'état in 1962, a military dictatorship.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were the names of some of the early cultures located in Myanmar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the dominant religion of Myanmar become something outside of the mainstream ? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused the downfall of the downfall of the the original kingdom in Myanmar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose rule  was Myanmar under when it was one of the most massive kingdoms in Southeast Asia ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Taungoo Dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did was Myanmar ruled by the Taungoo Dynasty ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In the 16th century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For most of its independent years, the country has been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and Burma's myriad ethnic groups have been involved in one of the world's longest-running ongoing civil wars. During this time, the United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systematic human rights violations in the country. In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed. While former military leaders still wield enormous power in the country, Burmese Military have taken steps toward relinquishing control of the government. This, along with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners, has improved the country's human rights record and foreign relations, and has led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions. There is, however, continuing criticism of the government's treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority and its poor response to the religious clashes. In the landmark 2015 election, Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a majority in both houses, ending military rule.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What portion of the government was eventually separated from government participation? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the military junta</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Has the country been able to overcome the problems of government with the previous regime?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a majority in both houses, ending military rule.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of government is now established in Myanmar?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a nominally civilian government</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are previous leaders a hendrence to the current government?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">former military leaders still wield enormous power in the country</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What major conflict is Myanmar known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one of the world's longest-running ongoing civil wars.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In English, the country is popularly known as either &quot;Burma&quot; or &quot;Myanmar&quot; i/ˈmjɑːnˌmɑːr/.

By March 1942, within months after they entered the war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon and the British administration had collapsed. A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. Wingate's British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines. A similar American unit, Merrill's Marauders, followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943. Beginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945. The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Overall, the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma. Only 1,700 prisoners were taken.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Was Burma effected by the world wars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burma was devastated during World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Did the British protect Burma as its colony during WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the British administration had collapsed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where groups from Burma an advantage to the Allies during WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines.

The law created three categories of citizenship: citizenship, associate citizenship, and naturalised citizenship. Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as Kachin, Kayah (Karenni), Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, Kaman, or Zerbadee. Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823, but can prove they have one grandparent, or pre-1823 ancestor, who was a citizen of another country, as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws. Naturalized citizenship is only given to those who have at least one parent with one of these types of Burmese citizenship or can provide &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that their parents entered and resided in Burma prior to independence in 1948. The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace them—this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 Rohingya from Burma, while the Rohingya people have been described as &quot;among the world's least wanted&quot; and &quot;one of the world's most persecuted minorities.&quot; But the origin of ‘most persecuted minority’ statement is unclear.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What section of the Burmese population is routinely discriminated against ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Rohingya people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the citizenship laws placed into effect in Burma ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1982</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does one become a full citizen in Burma ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What races are considered for full citizenship in Burma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">national races such as Kachin, Kayah (Karenni), Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, Kaman, or Zerbadee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens if one is not able to prove ancestral claim on full citizenship ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Rohingya lose citizenship rights in Burma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is the decision made on who gets full citizenship rights in Burma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What races are considered to be the of the the national races in Burma ?

In 1930s, agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined, and did not recover for several decades.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In terms of finance, when being ruled by the English, where did Burma stand ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Under British administration, Myanmar was the second-wealthiest country in South-East Asia.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Burma's greatest export during that time of English rule ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Myanmar do that made it know to be one of the originals in a particular finance producing endeavor ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burma began exporting crude oil in 1853, making it one of the earliest petroleum producers in the world.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What wood product was produced primarily in Myanmar during British rule ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">75% of the world's teak</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What notable quality made Burma stand out from other South East Asian countries ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a highly literate population</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During World War II, the British destroyed the major government buildings, oil wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese.

After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two thirds and mineral exports by over 96% (as compared to the pre-World War II period).

More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh over the last 20 years to escape Islamophobic persecution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Does Burma have more than one religion ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Many religions are practised in Myanmar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are public displays allowed for the celebration of religion in Myanmar ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Festivals can be held on a grand scale.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Are all welcomed to practice faith openly in Burma </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can anyone in Burma Join the military forces in Burma ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the best routes for career achievement in Burma ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Pew Research, 7% of the population identifies as Christian; 4% as Muslim; 1% follows traditional animistic beliefs; and 2% follow other religions, including Mahayana Buddhism, Hinduism, and East Asian religions.
