As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until 1914).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the date of the earliest known human activity on Cyprus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10th millennium BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Cyprus home to of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the oldest water wells in the world</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Cyprus settled by in 2nd millennium BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mycenaean Greeks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What empires have occupied Cyprus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Ottoman rule occur in Cyprus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between 1571 and 1878</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cyprus was placed under British administration based on Cyprus Convention in 1878 and formally annexed by Britain in 1914. Even though Turkish Cypriots made up only 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s. Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an &quot;extension of Anatolia&quot; by them; while since the 19th century, the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece, which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s. Following nationalist violence in the 1950s, Cyprus was granted independence in 1960. In 1963, the 11-year intercommunal violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots started, which displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots and brought the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the republic. On 15 July 1974, a coup d'état was staged by Greek Cypriot nationalists and elements of the Greek military junta in an attempt at enosis, the incorporation of Cyprus into Greece. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed, and the displacement of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots. A separate Turkish Cypriot state in the north was established in 1983. These events and the resulting political situation are matters of a continuing dispute.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Cyprus placed under British administration?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1878</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Cyprus annexed by Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Cyprus granted independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1960</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the intercommunal violence between Greek and Cypriots occur?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1963</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Turkish Cypriots were displaced due to the 11 year violence in 1963? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Republic of Cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters, according to international law, except for the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, administered as Sovereign Base Areas.

Cyprus occupies an important role in Greek mythology being the birthplace of Aphrodite and Adonis, and home to King Cinyras, Teucer and Pygmalion.

The Venetians fortified Nicosia by building the Venetian Walls, and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the Ottoman Empire frequently raided Cyprus.

This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1828, modern Greece's first president Ioannis Kapodistrias called for union of Cyprus with Greece, and numerous minor uprisings took place. Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful.

These religious officials, together with Greek military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the Megali Idea, would later found the guerrilla organisation Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston or National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA).

The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader Menderes considered Cyprus an &quot;extension of Anatolia&quot;, rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that &quot;Cyprus is Turkish&quot; and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising the fact that the Turkish Cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan &quot;Partition or Death&quot; was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Zürich and London conferences Turkey seemed to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island of Cyprus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Turkish Cypriots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Initially Turkish Cypriots favoured the continued rule of what Western power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of the population did Turkish Cypriots make up?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What slogan was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot protests?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Partition or Death&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In January 1950, the Church of Cyprus organised a referendum under the supervision of clerics and with no Turkish Cypriot participation, where 96% of the participating Greek Cypriots voted in favour of enosis, The Greeks were 80.2% of the total island' s population at the time (census 1946).

While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Cypriot universities ignore when looking at admission?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high school grades</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is required for university attendance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">high-school diploma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What plays a large factor in determining admission at a university?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">university entrance examinations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage do grades obtained account for in a students final grade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British, Turkish, other European and North American universities.
