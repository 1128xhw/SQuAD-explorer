This is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism, and DNA repair and recombination. While important genes participating in the DNA to RNA transcription, protein translation and DNA/RNA replication are retained. That is, a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter-genic regions or open reading frame (ORF) size. Thus, species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them, thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates. As the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission, intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process, resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes when compared to the free living bacteria. This incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as Muller's ratchet phenomenon. Muller's ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non-essential genes of the intracellular bacteria. This could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the main alteration in an endosymbiont when it adapts to a host?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drastic reduction in its genome size</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term that describes the way the endosymbiont can't go back to its original phenotype?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Muller's ratchet phenomenon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the article say could be the reason for the buildup of harmful mutations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lack of selection mechanisms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped.

Competition is where a larger or stronger organisms deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. Antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism.[citation needed] An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name for the kind of symbiosis in which one organism is seriously harmed and there is no affect on the other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amensalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kinds of amensalism are there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">competition and antibiosis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When a large tree takes the resources a young tree needs, what type of amensalism is it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">competition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the black walnut give out that kills plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">juglone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Amensalism is an interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by the other.

This theory is supported by certain organelles dividing independently of the cell, and the observation that some organelles seem to have their own nucleic acid.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What far-reaching result do scientists think has come about from symbiosis with bacteria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the evolution of all eukaryotes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are eukaryotes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">plants, animals, fungi, and protists</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The biologist Lynn Margulis, famous for her work on endosymbiosis, contends that symbiosis is a major driving force behind evolution. She considers Darwin's notion of evolution, driven by competition, to be incomplete and claims that evolution is strongly based on co-operation, interaction, and mutual dependence among organisms. According to Margulis and Dorion Sagan, &quot;Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Margulis think is the main driver of evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">symbiosis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who agrees with Margulis' cooperative view of evolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dorion Sagan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Symbiosis played a major role in the co-evolution of flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them. Many plants that are pollinated by insects, bats, or birds have highly specialized flowers modified to promote pollination by a specific pollinator that is also correspondingly adapted. The first flowering plants in the fossil record had relatively simple flowers. Adaptive speciation quickly gave rise to many diverse groups of plants, and, at the same time, corresponding speciation occurred in certain insect groups. Some groups of plants developed nectar and large sticky pollen, while insects evolved more specialized morphologies to access and collect these rich food sources. In some taxa of plants and insects the relationship has become dependent, where the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of insect.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How big a part did symbiosis have in the development of flowering plants and their pollinators?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a major role</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did some plants produce when flowers became less simple?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nectar and large sticky pollen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the word for the kind of relationship in which a plant depend on a single type of insect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dependent</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
