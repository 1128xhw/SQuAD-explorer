He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Bermúdez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia (a term originally applied to all of the North American continent) two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was of what nationality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spanish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the first European explorer to reach Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Juan de Bermúdez</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal did the Spaniards or other Europeans bring to the island that then became wild inhabitants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pigs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company permanently settled Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the English Virginia Company</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first known European explorer to reach Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Juan de Bermúdez</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Jaun de Bermudez first reach Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1503</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did Bermudez visit the archipelago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal are European parties responsible for releasing in Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pigs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the English Virginia Company settle permanently in Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1609</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The island was administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614. Its spin-off, the Somers Isles Company, took over in 1615 and managed the colony until 1684. At that time, the company's charter was revoked, and the English Crown took over administration. The islands became a British colony following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. After 1949, when Newfoundland became part of Canada, Bermuda was automatically ranked as the oldest remaining British Overseas Territory. Since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, it is the most populous Territory.

It has a subtropical climate. Bermuda is the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather.

Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda include its national bird, the Bermuda petrel or cahow. It was rediscovered in 1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620s. It is important as an example of a Lazarus species. The government has a programme to protect it, including restoration of a habitat area. The Bermuda rock skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. Recently through genetic DNA studies, scientists have discovered that a species of turtle, the diamondback terrapin, previously thought to have been introduced, pre-dated the arrival of humans in the archipelago. As this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds, some question whether it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The only indigenous mammals of Bermuda are five species of what animal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the national bird of Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bermuda petrel or cahow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal was believe to be the only land vertebrate of Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bermuda rock skink</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal was found, through DNA testing, to pre-date the arrival of humans to the archipelago?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diamondback terrapin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the only native mammals found in Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the national bird of Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bermuda petrel or cahow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the National bird of importance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">example of a Lazarus species</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What animal has held the title of Bermuda's only native land vertabrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bermuda rock skink</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is there a debate as to dubbing the diamondback terrapin the oldest indigenous land vertebrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The island experienced large-scale immigration over the 20th century, especially after the Second World War.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, &quot;coloured&quot; (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority.

Although the number of residents born in Africa is very small, it has tripled between 2000 and 2010 (this group also includes non-blacks). The majority of blacks in Bermuda can be termed &quot;Bermudian blacks&quot;, whose ancestry dates back centuries between the 17th century and the end of slavery in 1834, Bermuda's black population was self-sustaining, with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion. This contrasts to the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies, who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate, and slaveholders in the United States and the West Indies found it necessary to continue importing more enslaved blacks from Africa until the end of slavery (the same had been true for the Native Americans that the Africans had replaced on the New World plantations). The indigenous populations of many West Indian islands, and much of the South-East of what is now the United States that had survived the 16th- and 17th-century epidemics of European-introduced diseases then became the victims of large-scale slave raiding, with much of the region completely depopulated. When the supply of indigenous slaves ran out, the slaveholders looked to Africa). The ancestry of Bermuda's black population is distinguished from that of the British West Indian black population in two ways: firstly, the higher degree of European and Native American admixture; secondly, the source of the African ancestry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What term is used to refer to the majority of black people in Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bermudian blacks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were so many blacks repeatedly being imported from Africa?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why can Bermudian blacks trace their ancestry back over centuries in Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bermuda's black population was self-sustaining, with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one way that the ancestry of Bermudian black population differs from that of British West Indian black population?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the source of the African ancestry</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the British West Indian islands (and also in the United States), the majority of enslaved blacks brought across the Atlantic came from West Africa (roughly between modern Senegal and Ghana). Very little of Bermuda's original black emigration came from this area. The first blacks to arrive in Bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from Spanish-speaking areas of the West Indies, and most of the remainder were recently enslaved Africans captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. As Spain and Portugal sourced most of their slaves from South-West Africa (the Portuguese through ports in modern-day Angola; the Spanish purchased most of their African slaves from Portuguese traders, and from Arabs whose slave trading was centred in Zanzibar). Genetic studies have consequently shown that the African ancestry of black Bermudians (other than those resulting from recent immigration from the British West Indian islands) is largely from the a band across southern Africa, from Angola to Mozambique, which is similar to what is revealed in Latin America, but distinctly different from the blacks of the West Indies and the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the black population in Bermuda different from that in the British West Indies and the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The first blacks to arrive in Bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from Spanish-speaking areas of the West Indies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Spanish and Portugese enslave most of their black people from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South-West Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one way we can show that black Bermudians are of different heritage than African Americans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genetic studies</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most of Bermuda's black population trace some of their ancestry to Native Americans, although awareness of this is largely limited to St David's Islanders and most who have such ancestry are unaware of it.

These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as the Football Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created and popularized many of the sports that we love today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">British Public schools and universities in the 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were sports important in these schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded organizations like the FA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Former public schoolboys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What changed in 1885 due to the FA changing rules?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">association of football with the working classes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys.

The officers soon switched to sail racing, founding the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the Public schoolboys in these sports?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were sports introduced in Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which sport did not transfer well to Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rowing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which sport was quickly adopted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sail racing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bermuda's national cricket team participated in the Cricket World Cup 2007 in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a 130 kilograms (290 lb) police officer named Dwayne Leverock. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a One-Day International (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well-known is David Hemp, a former captain of Glamorgan in English first class cricket. The annual &quot;Cup Match&quot; cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the St. George's Garrison (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Bermuda sport team participated in the 2007 world cup?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">national cricket team</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Bermuda's most popular Cricket player?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dwayne Leverock</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who defeated Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What began in 1872 when the game of cricket was introduced to Bermuda?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">annual &quot;Cup Match&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is there an East End/West End rivalry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rivalry resulted from the locations</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.
