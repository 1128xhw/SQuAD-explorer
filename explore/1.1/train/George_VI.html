The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct mention of the monarch from the country's constitution on the day of his accession. From 1939, the Empire and Commonwealth, except Ireland, was at war with Nazi Germany. War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, George remained as king of both countries, but the title Emperor of India was abandoned in June 1948. Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign. His elder daughter, Elizabeth, succeeded him.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which country did George VI stop using the title Emperor but continue to use the title of King?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what month and year did George VI discontinue using the title Emperor of India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 1948</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1949 what country solely proclaimed independence from the Commonwealth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ireland</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Child of George VI ascended the throne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Elizabeth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name used after the dissolution of the British Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Commonwealth of Nations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Britain and allies victorious in the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1945</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did India and Pakistan gain independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1947</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What title did George have in India prior to 1948?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Emperor of India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ireland declare itself in 1950?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">republic</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>His birthday (14 December 1895) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been &quot;rather distressed&quot;. Two days later, he wrote again: &quot;I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her&quot;. Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: &quot;I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good&quot;. Consequently, he was baptised &quot;Albert Frederick Arthur George&quot; at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as &quot;Bertie&quot;. His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name &quot;may supplant the less favoured one&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What month and day was the death of Prince Albert?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">14 December</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Prince Albert's great grandmother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Victoria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Prince Albert's nickname?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bertie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which church was Prince Albert baptized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">St. Mary Magdalene's Church</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship HMS Cumberland in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada.

One year after his commission, he began service in the First World War. He was mentioned in despatches for his action as a turret officer aboard Collingwood in the Battle of Jutland (31 May â€“ 1 June 1916), an indecisive engagement with the German navy that was the largest naval action of the war.

He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918, before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at St Leonards-on-Sea where he completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing. He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot. During the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy, France. Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain. He accompanied the Belgian monarch King Albert on his triumphal reentry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and gained a promotion to squadron leader on the following day.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What position was Albert appointed at Cranwell?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which number squadron was Albert appointed commanding officer in 1918?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Albert become a RAF pilot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the king of Belgium  in 1918?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Albert</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In October 1919, Albert went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied history, economics and civics for a year. On 4 June 1920, he was created Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney. He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the &quot;Industrial Prince&quot;. His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at Wimbledon in the Men's Doubles with Louis Greig in 1926, losing in the first round. He developed an interest in working conditions, and was President of the Industrial Welfare Society. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Albert study in Trinity College?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">history, economics and civics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Albert's nickname as he toured coal mines, factories, and railyards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Industrial Prince</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is Albert's older brother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which sport was Albert proficient at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tennis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which society was Albert the president of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Industrial Welfare Society</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite Sheila, Lady Loughborough, came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her. That year, he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. He became determined to marry her. She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family. In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be &quot;made or marred&quot; by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Albert infatuated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sheila, Lady Loughborough</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the youngest daughter of Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did Elizabeth reject Albert's proposal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were royals usually expected to marry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fellow royals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking.

The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Albert fear speaking in public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his stammer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who helped Albert improve in public speaking?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lionel Logue</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Albert play partnered with a black man?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">doubles tennis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Duke open in Australia in 1927? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parliament House</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: Elizabeth (called &quot;Lilibet&quot; by the family), and Margaret.

This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family. While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian John Grigg to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as &quot;the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which prime minister was the King constitutionally bound to support?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Neville Chamberlain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which agreement was signed in 1938?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Munich Agreement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The balcony in which palace is famous for being where the royal family makes appearances?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buckingham Palace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which historian commented that the king's act in associating with Chamberlain as unconstitutional?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Grigg</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In May and June 1939, the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States.

George was the first reigning monarch of Canada to visit North America, although he had been to Canada previously as Prince Albert and as Duke of York. Both Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir and Mackenzie King hoped that the King's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions. On 19 May, George VI personally accepted and approved the Letter of Credence of the new U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Daniel Calhoun Roper; gave Royal Assent to nine parliamentary bills; and ratified two international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada. The official royal tour historian, Gustave Lanctot, wrote &quot;the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality&quot; and George gave a speech emphasising &quot;the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two countries did the King and Queen tour in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Canada and the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the prime minister of Canada in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Lyon Mackenzie King</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What title was the king and queen presented with when touring Canada?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King and Queen of Canada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Roper's position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. Ambassador to Canada</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Statute of Westminster do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The trip was intended to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public. The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled. They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York. A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of tendencies did North America have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">isolationist tendencies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was George's predecessor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward VIII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the President of the United States in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President Franklin D.

George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The first German raid on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: &quot;I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face&quot;. The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country. They were subject to rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King's brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Against who did Britain declare war against in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nazi Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which city did the king and queen stay in even with the bombing threats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">London</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people died on the first German raid on London?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one thousand civilians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the King's brother die in service?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1942</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1940, Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister, though personally George would have preferred to appoint Lord Halifax.

The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the Commonwealth, gathered pace after the Second World War. During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India, and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, but he remained King of Pakistan until his death and India recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the association of independent states in Britain called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Commonwealth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two dominions did British India become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India and Pakistan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What country left the Commonwealth in January 1948?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burma</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the Republic of Ireland formed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1947, the King and his family toured Southern Africa.

A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right lumbar sympathectomy in March 1949. His elder daughter Elizabeth, the heir presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, taking the place of the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found. In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the King's speech from the throne was read for him by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds.
