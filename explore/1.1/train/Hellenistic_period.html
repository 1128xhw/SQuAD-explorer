At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mathematician advance Greek Science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek Science</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What period saw the rise of New Comedy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hellenistic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Battle of Actium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">31 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Alexander the Great die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">323 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What period saw the rise of the Septuagint?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hellenistic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">dd</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">yptian Se</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">dd</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddh</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">dd</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">m and E</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">dd</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddhism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">d</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Gre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ruler's death in 323 BC marks the beginning of the Hellenistic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexander the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Battle of Actium take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">31 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kingdom did the Romans take over the year after the Battle of Actium?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ptolemaic Egypt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of poetry debuted in the Hellenistic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexandrian poetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ancient religion did Greece embrace during the Hellenistic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddhism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What signified the emergence of the Roman Empire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Actium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What event is the recognized beginning of the Hellenistic Period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">death of Alexander the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who advanced Greek Science?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards &quot;barbarian&quot; cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific &quot;mother city&quot;. The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a common Attic-based dialect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Koine Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Ptolemaic Kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">north-east Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South Asia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Indo-Greek Kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South Asia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Kingdom of Pergamon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">south-west Asia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the Ptolemaic Kingdom located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">north-east Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Alexander the Great was the emperor of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persian Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Hellenistic Period expanded the Greek Empire into what 2 continents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Asia and Africa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the new, Attic-based dialect called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Koine Greek</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Scholars and historians are divided as to what event signals the end of the Hellenistic era.

Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Geschichte des Hellenismus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">J.

It was against this backdrop, that the ascendancy of Macedon began, under king Philip II. Macedon was located at the periphery of the Greek world, and although its royal family claimed Greek descent, the Macedonians themselves were looked down upon as semi-barbaric by the rest of the Greeks.

Although Eumenes, satrap of Cappadocia, defeated the rebels in Asia Minor, Perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes (possibly with Ptolemy's aid) during his invasion of Egypt (c. 21 May to 19 June, 320). Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas's murderers, making Peithon and Arrhidaeus regents in his place, but soon these came to a new agreement with Antipater at the Treaty of Triparadisus. Antipater was made regent of the Empire, and the two kings were moved to Macedon. Antigonus remained in charge of Asia minor, Ptolemy retained Egypt, Lysimachus retained Thrace and Seleucus I controlled Babylon.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Diadochi plan to marry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cleopatra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Alexander's sister?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cleopatra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader in Asia Minor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antigonus I Monophthalmus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Antipater and Craterus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus invaded which region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anatolia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes murdered whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Perdiccas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The second Diadochi war began following the death of Antipater in 319 BC.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (&quot;the thunderbolt&quot;), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls.

Celtic coinage was influenced by Greek designs, and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins, especially those of Southern France. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. The Hellenistic period saw the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and according to Strabo, Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek.

The Ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the Ptolemies as gods, and temples to the Ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom. Ptolemy I even created a new god, Serapis, who was combination of two Egyptian gods: Apis and Osiris, with attributes of Greek gods. Ptolemaic administration was, like the Ancient Egyptian bureaucracy, highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible though tariffs, excise duties, fines, taxes and so forth. A whole class of petty officials, tax farmers, clerks and overseers made this possible. The Egyptian countryside was directly administered by this royal bureaucracy.

It included a diverse population estimated at fifty to sixty million people. Under Antiochus I (c. 324/3 – 261 BC), however, the unwieldy empire was already beginning to shed territories. Pergamum broke away under Eumenes I who defeated a Seleucid army sent against him. The kingdoms of Cappadocia, Bithynia and Pontus were all practically independent by this time as well. Like the Ptolemies, Antiochus I established a dynastic religious cult, deifying his father Seleucus I. Seleucus, officially said to be descended from Apollo, had his own priests and monthly sacrifices. The erosion of the empire continued under Seleucus II, who was forced to fight a civil war (239-236) against his brother Antiochus Hierax and was unable to keep Bactria, Sogdiana and Parthia from breaking away.

The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also included the sons of settlers who had married local women) could make up a phalanx of 35,000 men (out of a total Seleucid army of 80,000) during the reign of Antiochos III. The rest of the army was made up of native troops. Antiochus III the great conducted several vigorous campaigns to retake all the lost provinces of the empire since the death of Seleucus I. After being defeated by Ptolemy IV's forces at Raphia (217), Antiochus III led a long campaign to the east to subdue the far eastern breakaway provinces (212-205) including Bactria, Parthia, Ariana, Sogdiana, Gedrosia and Drangiana. He was successful, bringing back most of these provinces into at least nominal vassalage and receiving tribute from their rulers. After the death of Ptolemy IV (204), Antiochus took advantage of the weakness of Egypt to conquer Coele-Syria in the fifth Syrian war (202-195). He then began expanding his influence into Pergamene territory in Asia and crossed into Europe, fortifying Lysimachia on the hellespont, but his expansion into Anatolia and Greece was abruptly halted after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BCE). In the Treaty of Apamea which ended the war, Antiochus lost all of his territories in Anatolia west of the Taurus and was forced to pay a large indemnity of 15,000 talents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Seleucid Empire was mostly dominated by whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greco-Macedonian political elite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Seleucid garrisons called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">choria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Seleucid military colonies called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">katoikiai</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who defeated Antiochus III at Raphia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ptolemy IV</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Ptolemy IV die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">204</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the death of Lysimachus, one of his officers, Philetaerus, took control of the city of Pergamum in 282 BC along with Lysimachus' war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to Seleucus I while remaining de facto independent.

In the early 2nd century BC, the Galatians became allies of Antiochus the Great, the last Seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over Asia Minor. In 189 BC, Rome sent Gnaeus Manlius Vulso on an expedition against the Galatians. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BC onward.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Celts who settled in Galatia pass through?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thrace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What battle did the Celts lose to Seleucus I?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">battle of the Elephants</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What famous statue signified the victory of the Greeks over a worthy enemy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dying Gaul</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century did the Galatians become allies of Antiochus the Great?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2nd century BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who sent Gnaeus Manlius Vulso on an expedition against the Galatians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rome</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia.

His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Bithynians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">King Bas defeated which general of Alexander?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Calas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who assumed the title of king from Bas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zipoetes I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Zipoetes I assume the role of king?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">297 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Nicomedia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nicomedes I</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 255 B.C., Ariarathes III took the title of king and married Stratonice, a daughter of Antiochus II, remaining an ally of the Seleucid kingdom.

After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, the Parthians fought frequently against neighbouring Rome in the Roman–Parthian Wars (66 BC – 217 AD). Abundant traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire. The Parthians used Greek as well as their own Parthian language (though lesser than Greek) as languages of administration and also used Greek drachmas as coinage. They enjoyed Greek theater and Greek art influenced Parthian art. The Parthians continued worhipping Greek gods syncretized together with Iranian deities.

Aretas captured Damascus and built the Petra pool complex and gardens in the Hellenistic style. Though the Nabateans originally worshipped their traditional gods in symbolic form such as stone blocks or pillars, during the Hellenistic period they began to identify their gods with Greek gods and depict them in figurative forms influenced by Greek sculpture.

This period also saw the rise of a Hellenistic Judaism, which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and Antioch, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic to Koiné Greek.

The wars of Antiochus III brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198 and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute. Antiochus IV Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169 BCE after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence.

The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war, which coincided with civil wars in Rome. The last Hasmonean ruler, Antigonus II Mattathias, was captured by Herod and executed in 37 BCE. In spite of originally being a revolt against Greek overlordship, the Hasmonean kingdom and also the Herodian kingdom which followed gradually became more and more hellenized. From 37 BCE to 6 CE, the Herodian dynasty, Jewish-Roman client kings, ruled Judea. Herod the Great considerably enlarged the Temple (see Herod's Temple), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world.

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bactria was led by what king from 255-246 BCE?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Diodotus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Diodotus II overthrown?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">230 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What leader overthrew Diodotus II?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Euthydemus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by what Seleucid leader?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antiochus III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Antiochus III married his daughter off to whose son?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Euthydemus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to Strabo, the Greco-Bactrians seem to have had contacts with China through the silk road trade routes (Strabo, XI.XI.I). Indian sources also maintain religious contact between Buddhist monks and the Greeks, and some Greco-Bactrians did convert to Buddhism. Demetrius, son and successor of Euthydemus, invaded north-western India in 180 BC, after the destruction of the Mauryan empire there; the Mauryans were probably allies of the Bactrians (and Seleucids). The exact justification for the invasion remains unclear, but by about 175 BC, the Greeks ruled over parts of north-western India. This period also marks the beginning of the obfuscation of Greco-Bactrian history. Demetrius possibly died about 180 BC; numismatic evidence suggest the existence of several other kings shortly thereafter. It is probable that at this point that the Greco-Bactrian kingdom split into several semi-independent regions for some years, often warring amongst themselves. Heliocles was the last Greek to clearly rule Bactria, his power collapsing in the face of central Asian tribal invasions (Scythian and Yuezhi), by about 130 BCE. However, Greek urban civilisation seems to have continued in Bactria after the fall of the kingdom, having a hellenising effect on the tribes which had displaced Greek-rule. The Kushan empire which followed continued to use Greek on their coinage and Greeks continued being influential in the empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who stated that the Greco-Bactrians had connections through the silk road?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Strabo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Demetrius, son of Euthydemus invade north-western India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">180 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose death signifies the beginning of confusing documentation of Greco-Bactrian history?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Demetrius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the last Greek to clearly rule Bactria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heliocles</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After Demetrius' death, civil wars between Bactrian kings in India allowed Apollodotus I (from c. 180/175 BCE) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside Antimachus II, likely the son of the Bactrian king Antimachus I. In about 155 (or 165) BC he seems to have been succeeded by the most successful of the Indo-Greek kings, Menander I. Menander converted to Buddhism, and seems to have been a great patron of the religion; he is remembered in some Buddhist texts as 'Milinda'.

The Bosporan Kingdom was a multi-ethnic kingdom of Greek city states and local tribal peoples such as the Maeotians, Thracians, Crimean Scythians and Cimmerians under the Spartocid dynasty (438–110 BCE). The Spartocids were a hellenized Thracian family from Panticapaeum. The Bosporans had long lasting trade contacts with the Scythian peoples of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and Hellenistic influence can be seen in the Scythian settlements of the Crimea, such as in the Scythian Neapolis. Scythian pressure on the Bosporan kingdom under Paerisades V led to its eventual vassalage under the Pontic king Mithradates VI for protection, circa 107 BCE. It later became a Roman client state. Other Scythians on the steppes of Central Asia came into contact with Hellenistic culture through the Greeks of Bactria. Many Scythian elites purchased Greek products and some Scythian art shows Greek influences. At least some Scythians seem to have become Hellenized, because we know of conflicts between the elites of the Scythian kingdom over the adoption of Greek ways. These Hellenized Scythians were known as the &quot;young Scythians&quot;. The peoples around Pontic Olbia, known as the Callipidae, were intermixed and Hellenized Greco-Scythians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before Hellenestic influence, Greek colonies were on the shores of the Taman and what other peninsula?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Crimean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kingdom under the Spartocid dynasty consisted of Maeotians, Thracians, Crimean Scythians and Cimmerians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bosporan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Scythian people with the Bosporans have strong trade contacts with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pontic-Caspian steppe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From whom did the Scythians of Central Asia discover Hellenistic culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greeks of Bactria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hellenized Scythians were known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">young Scythians</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Arabia, Bahrain, which was referred to by the Greeks as Tylos, the centre of pearl trading, when Nearchus came to discover it serving under Alexander the Great.

In 550 BCE, Mago I of Carthage began a series of military reforms which included copying the army of Timoleon, Tyrant of Syracuse. The core of Carthage's military was the Greek-style phalanx formed by citizen hoplite spearmen who had been conscripted into service, though their armies also included large numbers of mercenaries.

Although they initially resisted, allying themselves with Pyrrhus of Epirus, and defeating the Romans at several battles, the Greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the Roman republic.

The Romans, also allied with the Aetolian League of Greek city-states (which resented Philip's power), thus declared war on Macedon in 200 BC, starting the Second Macedonian War. This ended with a decisive Roman victory at the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC). Like most Roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant 'Peace of Flaminius' was designed utterly to crush the power of the defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, Philip's fleet was surrendered to Rome, and Macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the city-states of southern Greece, and land in Thrace and Asia Minor.

The Seleucid Antiochus III had allied with Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court). Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192–188 BC). In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Antiochus III allied with what king in 203 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philip V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who defeated Ptolemy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antiochus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what war was Ptolemy defeated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fifth Syrian War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What war bgean when Antiochus III invaded Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman-Syrian War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What years did the Roman-Syrian war take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">192–188 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Thus, in less than twenty years, Rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states, crippled another, and firmly entrenched its influence over Greece. This was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the Macedonian kings, and their unintended provocation of Rome; though Rome was quick to exploit the situation. In another twenty years, the Macedonian kingdom was no more. Seeking to re-assert Macedonian power and Greek independence, Philip V's son Perseus incurred the wrath of the Romans, resulting in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). Victorious, the Romans abolished the Macedonian kingdom, replacing it with four puppet republics; these lasted a further twenty years before Macedon was formally annexed as a Roman province (146 BC) after yet another rebellion under Andriscus. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground. In 146 BC, the Greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a Roman protectorate. Roman taxes were imposed, except in Athens and Sparta, and all the cities had to accept rule by Rome's local allies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Philip V's son who wanted to bring back Greek independence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Perseus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Perseus fought the Romans in what war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Third Macedonian War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Macedonia annexed by the Romans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">146 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Roman consul defeated the Greeks at Corinth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lucius Mummius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Greek peninsula become a Roman protectorate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">146 BC</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Attalid dynasty of Pergamum lasted little longer; a Roman ally until the end, its final king Attalus III died in 133 BC without an heir, and taking the alliance to its natural conclusion, willed Pergamum to the Roman Republic. The final Greek resistance came in 88 BC, when King Mithridates of Pontus rebelled against Rome, captured Roman held Anatolia, and massacred up to 100,000 Romans and Roman allies across Asia Minor. Many Greek cities, including Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined him in the Mithridatic wars. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who laid siege to Athens and razed the city. Mithridates was finally defeated by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) in 65 BC. Further ruin was brought to Greece by the Roman civil wars, which were partly fought in Greece. Finally, in 27 BC, Augustus directly annexed Greece to the new Roman Empire as the province of Achaea. The struggles with Rome had left Greece depopulated and demoralised. Nevertheless, Roman rule at least brought an end to warfare, and cities such as Athens, Corinth, Thessaloniki and Patras soon recovered their prosperity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the final king of the Attalid dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Attalus III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Attalus III die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">133 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who willed Pergamum to the Roman Republic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Attalus III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the final Greek resistance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">88 BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the final Greek resistance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mithridates of Pontus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Contrarily, having so firmly entrenched themselves into Greek affairs, the Romans now completely ignored the rapidly disintegrating Seleucid empire (perhaps because it posed no threat); and left the Ptolemaic kingdom to decline quietly, while acting as a protector of sorts, in as much as to stop other powers taking Egypt over (including the famous line-in-the-sand incident when the Seleucid Antiochus IV Epiphanes tried to invade Egypt). Eventually, instability in the near east resulting from the power vacuum left by the collapse of the Seleucid empire caused the Roman proconsul Pompey the Great to abolish the Seleucid rump state, absorbing much of Syria into the Roman republic. Famously, the end of Ptolemaic Egypt came as the final act in the republican civil war between the Roman triumvirs Mark Anthony and Augustus Caesar. After the defeat of Anthony and his lover, the last Ptolemaic monarch, Cleopatra VII at the Battle of Actium, Augustus invaded Egypt and took it as his own personal fiefdom. He thereby completed both the destruction of the Hellenistic kingdoms and the Roman republic, and ended (in hindsight) the Hellenistic era.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who tried to invade Egypt in the famous line-in-the-sand incident?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Roman proconsul ablished the Seleucid rump state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pompey the Great</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the last Ptolemaic monarch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cleopatra VII</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what battle was Mark Anthony defeated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Actium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What region did Augustus take on as his personal fiefdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Egypt</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In some fields Hellenistic culture thrived, particularly in its preservation of the past.

The museum and library of Alexandria was the center of this conservationist activity. With the support of royal stipends, Alexandrian scholars collected, translated, copied, classified and critiqued every book they could find. Most of the great literary figures of the Hellenistic period studied at Alexandria and conducted research there.

The city of Pergamon also had a large library and became a major center of book production. The island of Rhodes had a library and also boasted a famous finishing school for politics and diplomacy. Libraries were also present in Antioch, Pella, and Kos. Cicero was educated in Athens and Mark Antony in Rhodes.

The language of Philip II's and Alexander's court and army (which was made up of various Greek and non-Greek speaking peoples) was a version of Attic Greek, and over time this language developed into Koine, the lingua franca of the successor states.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Philip II and Alexander's court army spoke a version of what language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Attic Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Attic Greek developed into what lingua franca?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Koine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ai-Khanoum was situated on what kind of routes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trade</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The identification of local gods with similar Greek deities, a practice termed 'Interpretatio graeca', facilitated the building of Greek-style temples, and the Greek culture in the cities also meant that buildings such as gymnasia and theaters became common. Many cities maintained nominal autonomy while under the rule of the local king or satrap, and often had Greek-style institutions. Greek dedications, statues, architecture and inscriptions have all been found. However, local cultures were not replaced, and mostly went on as before, but now with a new Greco-Macedonian or otherwise Hellenized elite. An example that shows the spread of Greek theater is Plutarch's story of the death of Crassus, in which his head was taken to the Parthian court and used as a prop in a performance of The Bacchae. Theaters have also been found: for example, in Ai-Khanoum on the edge of Bactria, the theater has 35 rows – larger than the theater in Babylon.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The practice of identifying local gods with Greek deities is called what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Interpretatio graeca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote the story of Crassus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Plutarch</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Crassus' head is used a prop in what performance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Bacchae</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A 35 row theater at the edge of Bactria was found in what region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ai-Khanoum</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It seems likely that Alexander himself pursued policies which led Hellenization, such as the foundations of new cities and Greek colonies. While it may have been a deliberate attempt to spread Greek culture (or as Arrian says, &quot;to civilise the natives&quot;), it is more likely that it was a series of pragmatic measures designed to aid in the rule of his enormous empire. Cities and colonies were centers of administrative control and Macedonian power in a newly conquered region. Alexander also seems to have attempted to create a mixed Greco-Persian elite class as shown by the Susa weddings and his adoption of some forms of Persian dress and court culture. He also brought in Persian and other non-Greek peoples into his military and even the elite cavalry units of the companion cavalry. Again, it is probably better to see these policies as a pragmatic response to the demands of ruling a large empire than to any idealized attempt to bringing Greek culture to the 'barbarians'. This approach was bitterly resented by the Macedonians and discarded by most of the Diadochi after Alexander's death. These policies can also be interpreted as the result of Alexander's possible megalomania during his later years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led Hellenization practices by founding new Greek cities and colonies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexander</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Susa weddings were an example of how Alexander mixed Greek culture with what other culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Persian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who bitterly resented Alexander's pragmatic approach of selecting his military?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Macedonians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Alexander suffered from what mental disorder?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">megalomania</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native &quot;barbarians&quot; and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Native populations in the Hellenistic world were discriminated by what peoples?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Hellinistic Gymnasiums could only be used by whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greeks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the areas of concentration from where Greek culture eminates?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">highly localized</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of the Seleucid empire were comprised of native elites?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2.5</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite their initial reluctance, the Successors seem to have later deliberately naturalized themselves to their different regions, presumably in order to help maintain control of the population.

This varied greatly on location, Athens, Sparta and most cities in the Greek mainland did not see much religious change or new gods (with the exception of the Egyptian Isis in Athens), while the multi-ethnic Alexandria had a very varied group of gods and religious practices, including Egyptian, Jewish and Greek. Greek emigres brought their Greek religion everywhere they went, even as far as India and Afghanistan. Non-Greeks also had more freedom to travel and trade throughout the Mediterranean and in this period we can see Egyptian gods such as Serapis, and the Syrian gods Atargatis and Hadad, as well as a Jewish synagogue, all coexisting on the island of Delos alongside classical Greek deities. A common practice was to identify Greek gods with native gods that had similar characteristics and this created new fusions like Zeus-Ammon, Aphrodite Hagne (a Hellenized Atargatis) and Isis-Demeter. Greek emigres faced individual religious choices they had not faced on their home cities, where the gods they worshiped were dictated by tradition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Egyptian god was worshipped in Athens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Isis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Zeus was paired with which local god?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ammon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Aphrodite was paired with which local god?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hagne</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Isis was paired with what local god?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Demeter</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The worship of dynastic ruler cults was also a feature of this period, most notably in Egypt, where the Ptolemies adopted earlier Pharaonic practice, and established themselves as god-kings.

The setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings (sacrifice, proskynesis, statues, altars, hymns) which put them on par with the gods (isotheism) than on actual belief of their divine nature. According to Peter Green, these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the Greeks and Macedonians.

The Supplementum Hellenisticum, a modern collection of extant fragments, contains the fragments of 150 authors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Menander is one of the few remaining pieces of what time of liteary work?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">New Comedy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only play that remains in it's entirety from the New Comedy era?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dyskolos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the collection that holds fragments of works from 150 authors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Supplementum Hellenisticum</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two years are debated as the date in which Menander was born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">342/1 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hellenistic poets now sought patronage from kings, and wrote works in their honor. The scholars at the libraries in Alexandria and Pergamon focused on the collection, cataloging, and literary criticism of classical Athenian works and ancient Greek myths. The poet-critic Callimachus, a staunch elitist, wrote hymns equating Ptolemy II to Zeus and Apollo. He promoted short poetic forms such as the epigram, epyllion and the iambic and attacked epic as base and common (&quot;big book, big evil&quot; was his doctrine). He also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of Alexandria, the famous Pinakes. Callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of Augustan poetry. Another poet, Apollonius of Rhodes, attempted to revive the epic for the Hellenistic world with his Argonautica. He had been a student of Callimachus and later became chief librarian (prostates) of the library of Alexandria, Apollonius and Callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other. Pastoral poetry also thrived during the Hellenistic era, Theocritus was a major poet who popularized the genre.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Hellenistic poets wish to court?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote hymns equating Ptolemy II to Zeus and Apollo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Callimachus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said &quot;Big book, big evil&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Callimachus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Callimachus' catalog at the library of Alexandria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pinakes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote Argonautica?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apollonius of Rhodes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Hellenistic period, many different schools of thought developed. Athens, with its multiple philosophical schools, continued to remain the center of philosophical thought. However Athens had now lost her political freedom and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period. In this political climate, Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia (un-disturbedness), autarky (self-sufficiency) and apatheia (freedom from suffering), which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune. This occupation with the inner life, with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What city remained the center of philosophical thought?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Athens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does ataraxia mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">un-disturbedness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does autarky mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self-sufficiency</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does apatheia mean?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">freedom from suffering</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who promoted freedom from pain as the ultimate goal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Epicurus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said social norms and material possesions were unnatural and useless?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Diogenes of Sinope</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group embraced hedonism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cyrenaics</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Stoicism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Zeno of Citium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who rejected Academic Skepticism in favor of Neoplatonism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Antiochus of Ascalon</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Hellenistic culture produced seats of learning throughout the Mediterranean.

Euclid developed proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem, for the infinitude of primes, and worked on the ﬁve Platonic solids. Eratosthenes used his knowledge of geometry to measure the circumference of the Earth. His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the Earth's axis (again with remarkable accuracy). Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun and invented the leap day.

Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries (misthophoroi; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including Tarantine cavalry, Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts. This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword. The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and Pontus. The use of war elephants also became common. Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the Mauryan empire, and used them to good effect at the battle of Ipsus. He kept a core of 500 of them at Apameia.

Many 19th century scholars contended that the Hellenistic period represented a cultural decline from the brilliance of classical Greece. Though this comparison is now seen as unfair and meaningless, it has been noted that even commentators of the time saw the end of a cultural era which could not be matched again. This may be inextricably linked with the nature of government. It has been noted by Herodotus that after the establishment of the Athenian democracy:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What century of scholars considered the Hellenistic period a decline in culture from classic Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did 19th century scholars view the Hellenistic period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a mirror</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The viewpoint that the Hellenistic period represented a decline in culture was proven to be meaningless and what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unfair</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, William Woodthorpe Tarn, between World War I and World War II and the heyday of the League of Nations, focused on the issues of racial and cultural confrontation and the nature of colonial rule. Michael Rostovtzeff, who fled the Russian Revolution, concentrated predominantly on the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie in areas of Greek rule. Arnaldo Momigliano, an Italian Jew who wrote before and after the Second World War, studied the problem of mutual understanding between races in the conquered areas. Moses Hadas portrayed an optimistic picture of synthesis of culture from the perspective of the 1950s, while Frank William Walbank in the 1960s and 1970s had a materialistic approach to the Hellenistic period, focusing mainly on class relations. Recently, however, papyrologist C. Préaux has concentrated predominantly on the economic system, interactions between kings and cities and provides a generally pessimistic view on the period. Peter Green, on the other hand, writes from the point of view of late 20th century liberalism, his focus being on individualism, the breakdown of convention, experiments and a postmodern disillusionment with all institutions and political processes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who focused on the issue of racial and cultural confrontation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Woodthorpe Tarn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which organization did Michael Rostovtzeff flee from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russian Revolution</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who studied the problem mutual understanding between races in conquered areas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Arnaldo Momigliano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Frank William Walbank mainly focused on which relations in his depictions of Hellinistic culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">class</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whish Hellinistic historian focused primarely on the economic system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">C.
