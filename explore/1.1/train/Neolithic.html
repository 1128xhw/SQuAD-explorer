At least seven stone circles, covering 25 acres (10 ha), contain limestone pillars carved with animals, insects, and birds. Stone tools were used by perhaps as many as hundreds of people to create the pillars, which might have supported roofs. Other early PPNA sites dating to around 9,500 to 9,000 BCE have been found in Jericho, Israel (notably Ain Mallaha, Nahal Oren, and Kfar HaHoresh), Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, and Byblos, Lebanon.

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vinča signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of Ġgantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did agrarian societies start to arise in Southeast Europe?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7th millennium BC</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was one of earliest farming sites in Europe found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vashtëmi, southeastern Albania</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of sculptures were found in the Balkans from 6000 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Anthropomorphic figurines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What trend led to Neolithic traditions spreading to northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cultural diffusion and migration of peoples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who possibly created the earliest system of writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Vinča culture</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2012, news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri, Goseong, Gangwon Province, South Korea, which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia. &quot;No remains of an agricultural field from the Neolithic period have been found in any East Asian country before, the institute said, adding that the discovery reveals that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the Korean Peninsula&quot;.

The roof was supported by beams from the inside. The rough ground was covered by platforms, mats, and skins on which residents slept.

These developments are also believed to have greatly encouraged the growth of settlements, since it may be supposed that the increased need to spend more time and labor in tending crop fields required more localized dwellings.

Supplementation of diet by hunting and gathering was to variable degrees precluded by the increase in population above the carrying capacity of the land and a high sedentary local population concentration. In some cultures, there would have been a significant shift toward increased starch and plant protein.
