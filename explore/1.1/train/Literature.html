Its Latin root literatura/litteratura (derived itself from littera, letter or handwriting) was used to refer to all written accounts, but intertwined with the roman concept of cultura: learning or cultivation. Literature often uses language differently than ordinary language (see literariness). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorised according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two key elements that distinguish literature as a written form of art?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">deemed to have artistic or intellectual value</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two major divisions of literature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fiction or non-fiction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides this major division, what are two other sub-divisions to describe literature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poetry or prose</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Prose literature can be sub-divided into what formats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the novel, short story or drama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What words are the Latin roots of the word &quot;literature?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literatura/litteratura</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Definitions of literature have varied over time; it is a &quot;culturally relative definition&quot;.

Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., &quot;scientific literature&quot;), as such writing must use language according to particular standards. The problem with the formalist definition is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language, those uses must first be identified; this is difficult because &quot;ordinary language&quot; is an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A definition of literature that incorporates style and the poetic nature of prose is what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">formalist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one example of writing that the formalist definition distinguishes literature from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">journalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What element of the formalist definition makes it difficult to apply?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;ordinary language&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of ordinary language makes it difficult to apply the formalist definition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The formalist definition when applied to industry writing allows it to be called literature when it does what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">must use language according to particular standards</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Poetry is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, prosaic ostensible meaning. Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse;[a] prose is cast in sentences, poetry in lines; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across metre or the visual aspects of the poem. Prior to the nineteenth century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is &quot;any kind of subject consisting of Rythm or Verses&quot;. Possibly as a result of Aristotle's influence (his Poetics), &quot;poetry&quot; before the nineteenth century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art. As a form it may pre-date literacy, with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What elements of language make for poetic literature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aesthetic and rhythmic qualities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Poetry is usually differentiated from prose by what factor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">verse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If prose uses sentences, what is the equivalent in poetry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Poetry was considered to need lines and meter until when?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the nineteenth century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The structure of poetry may have existed before what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literacy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Drama is literature intended for performance.

A play is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright that is intended for performance in a theatre; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters, and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. A closet drama, by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page.

War of the Worlds (radio) in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of Drama have been adapted for film or television.

The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about our history. Through the study of past literature we are able to learn about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. This can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to Greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments. Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but we can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in ‘‘Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage: Canto I’’ and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold. Through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. It is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature. Information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down. Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. In much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we continue to evolve and learn more and more.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Literature, regardless of how the definition is applied, can be interpreted as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">written records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">We can learn what by carefully examining our literature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">our history</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote &quot;Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lord Byron</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Passing information down through generations was made easier when our society did what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">once we began to write it down</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Authors of literature frequently reference what antecedents?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a more urban culture developed, academies provided a means of transmission for speculative and philosophical literature in early civilizations, resulting in the prevalence of literature in Ancient China, Ancient India, Persia and Ancient Greece and Rome. Many works of earlier periods, even in narrative form, had a covert moral or didactic purpose, such as the Sanskrit Panchatantra or the Metamorphoses of Ovid. Drama and satire also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production. Lyric poetry (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in East Asia where songs were collected by the Chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the Shijing or Book of Songs. Over a long period, the poetry of popular pre-literate balladry and song interpenetrated and eventually influenced poetry in the literary medium.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some classical societies whose literature is still studied today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ancient China, Ancient India, Persia and Ancient Greece and Rome</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides entertainment or informational value, classic literature also possessed what quality?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a covert moral or didactic purpose</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What societal evolution helped to develop drama and satire by providing a ready audience?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">urban culture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what settings did lyric poetry derive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">courts and aristocratic circles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a collection of classic Chinese lyric poetry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Shijing or Book of Songs</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, historiography, military science, agriculture, and poetry.

Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (769-269 BCE). The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism, of Daoism, of Mohism, of Legalism, as well as works of military science (e.g. Sun Tzu's The Art of War) and Chinese history (e.g. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records.

The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500–1000 BCE, and the &quot;circum-Vedic&quot; texts, as well as the redaction of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000-500 BCE, resulting in a Vedic period, spanning the mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age.

Plato and Aristotle authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of Western philosophy, Sappho and Pindar were influential lyric poets, and Herodotus and Thucydides were early Greek historians. Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece, of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.

The inevitable reaction was the explosion of Romanticism in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. But as the 19th-century went on, European fiction evolved towards realism and naturalism, the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. Much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasising unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. Writers such as Proust, Eliot, Joyce, Kafka and Pirandello exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What literary movement in the 1700s recalled the fantastical literature of medieval times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romanticism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What elements in 19th century European literature were a reaction to the romanticism movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">realism and naturalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two elements prevalent among characters at the center of romanticism works?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">individual experience and emotion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did naturalism effect the greater world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">influenced social and political change</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">20th century literature reacted to the objectivity of naturalism in the 19th century to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the subjective</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genre fiction also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms, in spite of its fixed formulas, through the enquiries of the skeptical detective and the alternative realities of science fiction.

The theory suggests that human beings possess a nature within them that demonstrates their true “self” and it suggests that the fulfillment of this nature is the reason for living. It also suggests that neurological development hinders actualizing the nature because a person becomes estranged from his or her true self. Therefore, literary devices reflect a characters’s and an author’s natural self. In his ‘‘Third Force Psychology and the Study of Literature’’, Paris argues “D.H Lawrence’s “pristine unconscious” is a metaphor for the real self”.
