The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis.

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague. Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks. As the leader of the Muses (Apollon Musegetes) and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry. Hermes created the lyre for him, and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo. Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was described at the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apollo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Apollo's son?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Asclepius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the lyre for Apollo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hermes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the term for hymns sung to Apollo?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paeans</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, Titan god of the sun, and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene, Titan goddess of the moon.

It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios (Ἀπελλαῖος), and the offerings apellaia (ἀπελλαῖα) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai (ἀπέλλαι). According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word apella (ἀπέλλα), which originally meant &quot;wall,&quot; &quot;fence for animals&quot; and later &quot;assembly within the limits of the square.&quot; Apella (Ἀπέλλα) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta, corresponding to the ecclesia (ἐκκλησία).

Plato in Cratylus connects the name with ἀπόλυσις (apolysis), &quot;redemption&quot;, with ἀπόλουσις (apolousis), &quot;purification&quot;, and with ἁπλοῦν ([h]aploun), &quot;simple&quot;, in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, Ἄπλουν, and finally with Ἀειβάλλων (aeiballon), &quot;ever-shooting&quot;. Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric ἀπέλλα (apella), which means &quot;assembly&quot;, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation σηκός (sekos), &quot;fold&quot;, in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds. In the Ancient Macedonian language πέλλα (pella) means &quot;stone,&quot; and some toponyms may be derived from this word: Πέλλα (Pella, the capital of Ancient Macedonia) and Πελλήνη (Pellēnē/Pallene).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What Doric word means assembly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">apella</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Ancient Macedonian word for stone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pella</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Greek word for &quot;to destroy?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">apollymi</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name, The Hittite form Apaliunas (dx-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš) is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter, perhaps related to Hurrian (and certainly the Etruscan) Aplu, a god of plague, in turn likely from Akkadian Aplu Enlil meaning simply &quot;the son of Enlil&quot;, a title that was given to the god Nergal, who was linked to Shamash, Babylonian god of the sun.

In archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with &quot;healing&quot;.

It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music.

In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality. Apollo's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period, and the frequency of theophoric names such as Apollodorus or Apollonios and cities named Apollonia testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at Didyma and Clarus pronounced the so-called &quot;theological oracles&quot;, in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing, highest deity. &quot;In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent.

Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, don't belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order. The Greeks used standard types, because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection. From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were narrow to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed, some mathematical relations became necessary, in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What buildings were originally rectangle wood structures?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">peripteral temples</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did mathematical relations become necessary?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in order to keep the original forms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were the first buildings narrow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to hold the roof</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who believed that behind the appearance of things, there was a permanent principle of mathematics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pythagoras</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor.

The formality of their stance seems to be related with the Egyptian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods. The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented. These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order. His shrine in Delphi, that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: γνῶθι σεαυτόν (gnōthi seautón=&quot;know thyself&quot;) and μηδὲν ἄγαν (mēdén ágan, &quot;nothing in excess&quot;), and ἐγγύα πάρα δ'ἄτη (eggýa pára d'atē, &quot;make a pledge and mischief is nigh&quot;).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the modern term given to those representations of stnding male youths that first appear in the archaic period in Greece?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kouros</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another word for male youth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kouros</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the immortal god of ideal balance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apollo</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life.

The statue is the &quot;thing in itself&quot;, and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the Dipylon master was named Daedalus, and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the New York kouros, which is the oldest fully preserved statue of Kouros type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The period between 640-580 BC was known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early archaic period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the Dipylon master?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daedalus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who created the New York kouros?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daedalus</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the Homeric poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god Hephaestus (Phaistos) and the mythic Daedalus (the builder of the labyrinth) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the Minoan period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment. These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is said to be the builder of the labyrinth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daedalus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During what period was art's main theme the representation of motion in a specific movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Minoan period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">These free-standing statues were sometimes rendered from immestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta but were usually made from what material?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">marble</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios, Boeotia alone. The last stage in the development of the Kouros type is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo. It was found in Piraeus, the harbour of Athens. The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. It probably comes from north-eastern Peloponnesus. The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art. The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler, and heavier style, restricts Ionian influence in Athens. Finally, this is the germ from which the art of Polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What period ran from 520-485 BC?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late archaic period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the harbour of Athens?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Piraeus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Piraeus Apollo hold in his left hand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the bow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Piraeus Apollo hold in his right hand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a cup of pouring libation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the next century which is the beginning of the Classical period, it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions. The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment (Myron), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant Minoan element. Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances. Polykleitos in his Canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of Pythagoras. The famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm. The type is represented by neo-Attic Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of Polykleitos but more archaic. The Apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Polykleitos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what type of art does the god hold the cithara in his left arm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apollo Citharoedus statue type</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of art is modeled after a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th Century BCE.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neo-Attic Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the Minoan period, and in the beliefs of the first Greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self. Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The statues of who were thought to incarnate his living presence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Apollo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in what period?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Minoan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What people saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Greeks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake.
