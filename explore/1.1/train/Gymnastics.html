The gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway. The body position is maintained while &quot;punching&quot; (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting platform. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the maximum length of the runway gymnasts sprint down before hurdling onto a spring board?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25 meters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is blocking using only a shoulder movement called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">punching</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one thing a successful vault depends on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the length of the hurdle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What may be added to a vault before landing in advanced gymnastics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">multiple twists and somersaults</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the maximum length of a runway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25 meters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gets to chose where a gymnast starts to run on the runway?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The gymnast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What position is the gymnast when in the air?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a standing position</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are later added to the landing by advanced gymnasts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">multiple twists and somersaults</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do successful vaults depend on other than speed of the run?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to FIG rules, only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics.

There are also group routines consisting of 5 gymnasts and 5 apparatuses of their choice.

The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts.

The rope must be coloured, either all or partially and may either be of a uniform diameter or be progressively thicker in the center provided that this thickening is of the same material as the rope. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swings, throws, circles, rotations and figures of eight.

Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength. The post flight segment may include one or more multiple saltos or somersaults, and/or twisting movements. A round-off entry vault, called a Yurchenko, is the most common vault in elite level gymnastics. When performing a yurchenko, gymnasts &quot;round-off&quot; so hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard (beatboard). From the roundoff position the gymnast travels backwards and executes a backhandspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table. The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations.

To avoid such injuries, and to receive a high performance score, proper technique must be used by the gymnast. &quot;The subsequent ground contact or impact landing phase must be achieved using a safe, aesthetic and well-executed double foot landing.&quot;  A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft, meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a critical skill in terms of execution in scores?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">landing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where do most injuries happen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the lower extremities such as: cartilage lesions, ligament tears, and bone bruises/fractures</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do you avoid injuries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">proper technique must be used by the gymnast</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a successful landing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">soft, meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Individual routines in trampolining involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills.

Additional points (with no maximum at the highest levels of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps. In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine.

These bars are made of fiberglass covered in wood laminate, to prevent them from breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. They've been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves, that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the Uneven Bars using a springboard, or a small mat. Chalk and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) may be used while doing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnast's hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands), dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the uneven bars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two horizontal bars set at different heights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are these bars made out of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fiberglass covered in wood laminate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are the bars not made of wood anymore?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the bars were prone to breaking,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How have the bars changed over the years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">They've been moved increasingly further apart</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How do gymnasts normally mount the uneven bars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">using a springboard, or a small mat</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A higher flight phase results in a higher vertical ground reaction force.

Men's events are floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and the high bar.

The system is used in the US for elite level competition. Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, an execution score and a difficulty score. In the previous system, the &quot;execution score&quot; was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are the most common deduction from a difficulty score, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did FIG decide that scores are no longer limited to 10 points?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two different scores?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an execution score and a difficulty score</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What score was added?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">difficulty score</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much is a fall deduction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.00 deduction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a gymnast's difficulty score based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">what elements they perform</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. Today, the floor event occurs on a carpeted 12m Ã— 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs or foam blocks generally called a &quot;spring&quot; floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event; Depending on the level, they may choose their own, or, if known as a &quot;compulsory gymnast,&quot; default music must be played. In some gymnastic associations such as United States Association of Gymnastic Clubs (USAIGC), gymnasts are allowed to have vocals in their music but at USA Gymnastics competitions a large deduction is taken from the score for having vocals in the music. The routine should consist of tumbling lines, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or piviots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling lines that usually includes at least one flight element without hand support. Each level of gymnastics requires the athlete to perform a different number of tumbling passes. In level 7 in the United States, a gymnast is required to do 2â€“3, and in levels 8â€“10, at least 3â€“4 tumbling passes are required.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the floor exercise events performed on now?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a carpeted 12m Ã— 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the floor exercise even on before?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why helps add an extra bounce to the floor?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">springs or foam blocks generally called a &quot;spring&quot; floor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the maximum for floor events?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up to 90 seconds</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In tumbling, athletes perform an explosive series of flips and twists down a sprung tumbling track.
