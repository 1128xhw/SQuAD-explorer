On October 16, 1875, Brigham Young, then president of the LDS Church, personally purchased the Lewis Building after previously hinting that a school would be built in Draper, Utah in 1867. Hence, October 16, 1875 is commonly held as BYU's founding date. Said Young about his vision: &quot;I hope to see an Academy established in Provo... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the first property for what would become BYU acquired?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">October 16, 1875</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for acquiring BYU's first building?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brigham Young</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Brigham  Young's school originally believed to be located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Draper, Utah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who began the school that previously existed at the site where BYU is now located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Warren Dusenberry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year can BYU's origin be traced to with a building called Cluff Hall?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1862</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which president of the LDS church purchased the Lewis Building after hinting at the building of a school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brigham Young</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of influences did Brigham Young hope to avoid with BYU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">atheistic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the commonly held founding year of BYU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1867</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Brigham Young hope to educate via BYU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">children of the Latter-day Saints</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The school broke off from the University of Deseret and became Brigham Young Academy, with classes commencing on January 3, 1876. Warren Dusenberry served as interim principal of the school for several months until April 1876 when Brigham Young's choice for principal arrived—a German immigrant named Karl Maeser. Under Maeser's direction the school educated many luminaries including future U.S. Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland and future U.S. Senator Reed Smoot among others. The school, however, did not become a university until the end of Benjamin Cluff, Jr's term at the helm of the institution. At that time, the school was also still privately supported by members of the community and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896. A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion; however, in his last official act, he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named &quot;Brigham Young University&quot;. The suggestion received a large amount of opposition, with many members of the Board saying that the school wasn't large enough to be a university, but the decision ultimately passed. One opponent to the decision, Anthon H. Lund, later said, &quot;I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What college did BYU separate from to become its own entity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Deseret</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did BYU first open its doors to students?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">January 3, 1876</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the head of the school for its first few months?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Warren Dusenberry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Latter Day Saints Church acknowledge and begin to support BYU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 18, 1896</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for proposing BYU's current name?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Benjamin Cluff, Jr</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which school did Brigham Young Acadamy, now BYU,  break off from in 1876?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">University of Deseret</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first Brigham Young Acadamy, now BYU,  principal chosen by Brigham Young?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Karl Maeser</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Brigham Young Acadamy become at the end of Benjamin Cluff Jr's term at the helm?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a university</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was BYU supported by before being sponsored by the LDS Church?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">members of the community</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Board opponent Anthon H.

(The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant &quot;Y&quot; that is to this day embedded on a mountain near campus.) The Board elected George H. Brimhall as the new President of BYU. He had not received a high school education until he was forty. Nevertheless, he was an excellent orator and organizer. Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought 17 acres (69,000 m2) of land from Provo called &quot;Temple Hill&quot;. After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial. Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. Joseph F. Smith, LDS Church president, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a &quot;religious seminary&quot;. However, many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and become well renowned in their fields.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Brigham Young Academy split into two separate schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1903</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the land purchased by BYU in 1904?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Temple Hill</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How old was George H.

Harris was appointed the university's president in 1921. He was the first BYU president to have a doctoral degree. Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it into a true university, whereas before, its organization had remnants of the Academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was not officially recognized as a university by any accreditation organization. By the end of his term, the school was accredited under all major accrediting organizations at the time. He was eventually replaced by Howard S. McDonald, who received his doctorate from the University of California. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah and rebuilt it to house some of the students. The next president, Ernest L. Wilkinson, also oversaw a period of intense growth, as the school adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible for the building of over eighty structures on the campus, many of which still stand. During his tenure, the student body increased six times, making BYU the largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school. Finally, Wilkinson reorganized the LDS Church units on campus, with ten stakes and over 100 wards being added during his administration.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of credentials did Franklin S.

Holland followed as president in 1980, encouraging a combination of educational excellence and religious faith at the university. He believed that one of the school's greatest strengths was its religious nature and that this should be taken advantage of rather than hidden. During his administration, the university added a campus in Jerusalem, now called the BYU Jerusalem Center. In 1989, Holland was replaced by Rex E. Lee. Lee was responsible for the Benson Science Building and the Museum of Art on campus. A cancer victim, Lee is memorialized annually at BYU during a cancer fundraiser called the Rex Lee Run.

Lee Library (also known as &quot;HBLL&quot;), which The Princeton Review ranked as the No. 1 &quot;Great College Library&quot; in 2004, has approximately 8½ million items in its collections, contains 98 miles (158 km) of shelving, and can seat 4,600 people. The Spencer W. Kimball Tower, shortened to SWKT and pronounced Swicket by many students, is home to several of the university's departments and programs and is the tallest building in Provo, Utah. Furthermore, BYU's Marriott Center, used as a basketball arena, can seat over 22,000 and is one of the largest on-campus arenas in the nation. Interestingly absent on the campus of this church owned university is a campus chapel. Notwithstanding, each Sunday LDS Church services for students are conducted on campus, but due to the large number of students attending these services, nearly all of the buildings and possible meeting spaces on campus are utilized (in addition, many students attend services off campus in LDS chapels in the surrounding communities).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many buildings are on BYU's main campus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">295</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many acres are included in BYU's main campus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">approximately 560</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is BYU's main campus located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Provo, Utah</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles of shelving are in BYU's Harold B.

This Museum aids in academic pursuits of students at BYU via research and study of the artworks in its collection. The Museum is also open to the general public and provides educational programming. The Museum of Peoples and Cultures is a museum of archaeology and ethnology. It focuses on native cultures and artifacts of the Great Basin, American Southwest, Mesoamerica, Peru, and Polynesia. Home to more than 40,000 artifacts and 50,000 photographs, it documents BYU's archaeological research. The BYU Museum of Paleontology was built in 1976 to display the many fossils found by BYU's Dr. James A. Jensen. It holds many artifacts from the Jurassic Period (210-140 million years ago), and is one of the top five collections in the world of fossils from that time period. It has been featured in magazines, newspapers, and on television internationally. The museum receives about 25,000 visitors every year. The Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum was formed in 1978.

Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the &quot;Cougars&quot;, and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars became an Independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season. The softball program may move again after the 2013 season; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many NCAA varsity teams does BYU have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">21</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of BYU's fight song?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cougar Fight Song</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are many BYU athletes older than other schools' players?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When does BYU refuse to play athletic games that got the attention of the sports networks?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sunday</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What violation can lead to a player being expelled from a sports team?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">honor code</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>BYU's stated mission &quot;is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.&quot; BYU is thus considered by its leaders to be at heart a religious institution, wherein, ideally, religious and secular education are interwoven in a way that encourages the highest standards in both areas.

Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization&quot;, which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In certain cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure. Both LDS and non-LDS students are required to meet annually with a Church leader to receive an ecclesiastical endorsement for both acceptance and continuance.
