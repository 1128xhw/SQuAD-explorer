The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibres; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is separated from the cellulose fibres?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lignin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of paper is paper made from chemical pulps known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wood-free</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of fibres are wasted in the bleaching process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of cotton is cellulose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are three main chemical pulping processes: the sulfite process dates back to the 1840s and it was the dominant method extent before the second world war. The kraft process, invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s, is now the most commonly practiced strategy, one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin, that produces heat, which can be used to run a generator. Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill. Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents. Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws, bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many chemical pulping processes are there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade does the sulfite process date to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1840s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What process is most commonly used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The kraft process</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another process used to pulp straws with high silicate content?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Soda pulping</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are two major mechanical pulps, the thermomechanical one (TMP) and groundwood pulp (GW).

In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, &gt;95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time.

Early papermakers did not realize that the alum they added liberally to cure almost every problem encountered in making their product would eventually be detrimental. The cellulose fibres that make up paper are hydrolyzed by acid, and the presence of alum would eventually degrade the fibres until the paper disintegrated in a process that has come to be known as &quot;slow fire&quot;.
