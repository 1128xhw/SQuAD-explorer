Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be &quot;absolute protection&quot;. &quot;If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions&quot;. This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of &quot;real&quot; property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the America Invents Act, stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of commodification derived from this possibility. The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the stated objective of most intellectual property law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Promote progress.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do patents create an incentive for inventors to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">create and disclose their work</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which view treats intellectual property as another type of &quot;real&quot; property?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">absolute protection or full value</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which recent law stresses international harmonization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">America Invents Act</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2013 the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the U.S. economy is more than US$5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million American people.

The United States also has federal law in the form of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831–1839), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, 18 U.S.C. § 1831(a), criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, 18 U.S.C. § 1832, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.)

In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called &quot;Human rights and intellectual property&quot; that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws. According to the Committee, when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health, and to cultural participation and scientific benefits. In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization which argues that WIPO should &quot;focus more on the needs of developing countries, and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who recognizes that conflicts may exist between IP and other human rights?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World Intellectual Property Organization</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was a document called &quot;Human rights and intellectual property&quot; issued?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2001</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who issued a document called &quot;Human rights and intellectual property&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said IP failures may infringe on human rights to food and health?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the WIPO adopt 'The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2004</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Further along these lines, The ethical problems brought up by IP rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines are given IP protection.

In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.

The Recording Industry Association of America, in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement, which the industry calls &quot;piracy&quot;. The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company Napster, and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted, that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting public domain works, limitations and exceptions to copyright, or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some copyleft licenses, like GNU GPL 3, are designed to counter that. Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for accessibility reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the recording industry call piracy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">copyright infringement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of company was Napster?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">file-sharing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What law enforces digital rights management systems?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which articles of the EU Copyright Directive address circumvention of copyright protection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Article 6 and 7</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Conditional Access Directive passed in the EU?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1998</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of &quot;trademark&quot;, as exemplified by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states.
