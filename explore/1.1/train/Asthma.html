Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers.

Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two factors cause asthma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">genetic and environmental factors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two enviromental factors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">exposure to air pollution and allergens</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What medications can also trigger asthma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aspirin and beta blockers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What patterns are used to diagnose asthma?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is asthma classified?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is no cure for asthma.

Occasionally the airways themselves change. Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis. Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands. Other cell types involved include: T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils.

Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet. Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.
