Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage. B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the four factors that determine how the body reacts to an antigen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Newborns are particularly susceptible to infections caused by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What activity is also greatly reduced in newborn infants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">phagocytic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are newborns described as being physiologically immunodeficient?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Antigen cells in newborns are also struggle to do this?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">activate T cells</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Maternal factors also play a role in the body’s immune response. At birth, most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal IgG. Because IgM, IgD, IgE and IgA don’t cross the placenta, they are almost undetectable at birth. Some IgA is provided by breast milk. These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months, but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity. These antibodies can also produce a negative response. If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response. Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization. Similarly the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults, and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates. Between six to nine months after birth, a child’s immune system begins to respond more strongly to glycoproteins, but there is usually no marked improvement in their response to polysaccharides until they are at least one year old. This can be the reason for distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In babies, what is another element impacting immune response?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Maternal factors</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Newborns can acquire antibodies from the mother through what means?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">breast milk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how long do these antibodies have an effect on infants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">up to 18 months</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At 6 to 9 months, an infant's immune system begins to respond to which proteins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">glycoproteins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The difference in responses in infant immune systems is the cause of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During adolescence, the human body undergoes various physical, physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones, of which the most significant in females is 17-β-oestradiol (an oestrogen) and, in males, is testosterone.

On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: &quot;self&quot; constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while &quot;nonself&quot; entities (e.g., pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response. The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex &quot;two-signal&quot; activation of T cells. The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What medical scientist first proposed the clonal selection theory of immunology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frank Burnet</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What triggers an immune response according to CST?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self/nonself distinction</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In CST, what triggers a destructive immune response?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;nonself&quot; entities (e.g., pathogens, an allograft)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What property of T cells caused modification of CST?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the complex &quot;two-signal&quot; activation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was clonal selection theory first proposed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In the mid-1950s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Bioscience is the overall major in which undergraduate students who are interested in general well-being take in college. Immunology is a branch of bioscience for undergraduate programs but the major gets specified as students move on for graduate program in immunology. The aim of immunology is to study the health of humans and animals through effective yet consistent research, (AAAAI, 2013). The most important thing about being immunologists is the research because it is the biggest portion of their jobs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What discipline can undergraduate students interested in general health study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bioscience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Immunology is a branch of what larger field of study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bioscience</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The goal of an immunologist is to study what beings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humans and animals</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The biggest part of an immunologist's job is what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">research</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two conditions apply to good immunological study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">effective yet consistent research</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most graduate immunology schools follow the AAI courses immunology which are offered throughout numerous schools in the United States.

It also has two different parts: Part I is an introduction to the basic principles of immunology and Part II is a clinically-oriented lecture series. On the other hand, the Advanced Course is another course for those who are willing to expand or update their understanding of immunology. It is advised for students who want to attend the Advanced Course to have a background of the principles of immunology. Most schools require students to take electives in other to complete their degrees. A Master’s degree requires two years of study following the attainment of a bachelor's degree. For a doctoral programme it is required to take two additional years of study.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Part 1 of the AAI introductory immunology course is meant to be what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an introduction to the basic principles of immunology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Part 2 of the AAI introductory immunology course revolves around what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">clinically-oriented lecture series</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What pre-requisite should enrollees in the advanced immunology course have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a background of the principles of immunology</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long does it typically take to earn a Master's degree?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">two years of study</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What program requires an additional two years of study?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a doctoral programme</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
