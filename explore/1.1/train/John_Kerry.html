For that service, he was awarded combat medals that include the Silver Star Medal, Bronze Star Medal, and three Purple Heart Medals. Securing an early return to the United States, Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War organization in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War.

As the Swift boats reached the Cửa Lớn River, Kerry's boat was hit by a B-40 rocket (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of shrapnel hit Kerry's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the Gulf of Thailand safely.

Running into heavy small arms fire from the river banks, Kerry &quot;directed the units to turn to the beach and charge the Viet Cong positions&quot; and he &quot;expertly directed&quot; his boat's fire causing the enemy to flee while at the same time coordinating the insertion of the ninety South Vietnamese troops (according to the original medal citation signed by Admiral Zumwalt). Moving a short distance upstream, Kerry's boat was the target of a B-40 rocket round; Kerry charged the enemy positions and as his boat hove to and beached, a Viet Cong (&quot;VC&quot;) insurgent armed with a rocket launcher emerged from a spider hole and ran. While the boat's gunner opened fire, wounding the VC in the leg, and while the other boats approached and offered cover fire, Kerry jumped from the boat to pursue the VC insurgent, subsequently killing him and capturing his loaded rocket launcher.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Kerry earn a Silver Star?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 28, 1969</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Kerry earn a Silver Star?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Duong Keo River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many swift boats did Kerry command?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his Swift boat and two other Swift boats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who awarded the Silver Star to Kerry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Admiral Zumwalt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What story described the events of Feb 28, 1969?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Death Of PCF 43</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kerry's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander George Elliott, stated to Douglas Brinkley in 2003 that he did not know whether to court-martial Kerry for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew.

Bush since the 2000 Presidential election (when he was accused of having used his father's political influence to gain entrance to the Texas Air National Guard, thereby protecting himself from conscription into the United States Army, and possible service in the Vietnam War), John Kerry's contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bush's re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter by calling Kerry's war record into question. As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerry's campaign. The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's, and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat. The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative 'swiftboating', to describe an unfair or untrue political attack. Most of Kerry's former crewmates have stated that SBVT's allegations are false.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who kept George W.

However, that rating was based only upon voting on legislation within that past year. In fact, in terms of career voting records, the National Journal found that Kerry is the 11th most liberal member of the Senate. Most analyses find that Kerry is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic Senator. Kerry has stated that he opposes privatizing Social Security, supports abortion rights for adult women and minors, supports same-sex marriage, opposes capital punishment except for terrorists, supports most gun control laws, and is generally a supporter of trade agreements.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would work &quot;immediately&quot; to convince Syria relinquish and destroy its large chemical weapons arsenal. Syria quickly welcomed this proposal and on September 14, the UN formally accepted Syria's application to join the convention banning chemical weapons, and separately, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons by the middle of 2014. On September 28, the UN Security Council passed a resolution ordering the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and condemning the August 21 Ghouta attack.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Syria's president in 2014?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bashar al-Assad</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Kerry say Syria could do to avoid a military strike?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which country convinced Syria to actually give up its chemical weapons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Sergey Lavrov's position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russian Foreign Minister</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the UN Security Council order Syria's chemical weapons be destroyed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">September 28</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In a speech before the Organization of American States in November 2013, Kerry remarked that the era of the Monroe Doctrine was over.

Regardless of which figure is correct, Kerry was the wealthiest U.S. Senator while serving in the Senate. Independent of Heinz, Kerry is wealthy in his own right, and is the beneficiary of at least four trusts inherited from Forbes family relatives, including his mother, Rosemary Forbes Kerry, who died in 2002. Forbes magazine (named for the Forbes family of publishers, unrelated to Kerry) estimated that if elected, and if Heinz family assets were included, Kerry would have been the third-richest U.S. President in history, when adjusted for inflation. This assessment was based on Heinz and Kerry's combined assets, but the couple signed a prenuptial agreement that keeps their assets separate. Kerry's financial disclosure form for 2011 put his personal assets in the range of $230,000,000 to $320,000,000, including the assets of his spouse and any dependent children. This included slightly more than three million dollars worth of H. J.
