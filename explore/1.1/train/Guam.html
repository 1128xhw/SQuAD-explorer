These influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs and fashion. During Spanish colonial rule (1668–1898) the majority of the population was converted to Roman Catholicism and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from Spanish trade between Mesoamerica and Asia. The modern Chamorro language is a Malayo-Polynesian language with much Spanish and Filipino influence. Many Chamorros also have Spanish surnames because of their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the adoption of names from the Catálogo alfabético de apellidos, a phenomenon also common to the Philippines.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">hat years did the Spanish rule Guam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1668–1898</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion was the general population converted to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman Catholicism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two major holidays become popular in Guam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Easter and Christmas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the modern Chamorro language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Malayo-Polynesian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Two aspects of indigenous pre-Hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule' and inafa'maolek.

Eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island. Soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers (planting trees) have had little success in preserving natural habitats.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What plagues the Guam dry season?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wildfires</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the cause of the majority of the fires in the area?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">man</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What causes water quality problems in Guam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the Fena Lake Reservoir and Ugum River</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Efforts have been made to protect Guam's coral reef habitats from pollution, eroded silt and overfishing, problems that have led to decreased fish populations. (Since Guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers, this is important.) In recent years, the Department of Agriculture, Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists. Before adopting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards, portions of Tumon Bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests. Tumon Bay has since been made into a preserve. A federal Guam National Wildlife Refuge in northern Guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of Mariana fruit bats.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has Guam recently being trying to protect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coral reef habitats</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has led to the decrease of fish near Guam?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pollution, eroded silt and overfishing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the flying mammal in Guam that some are concerned for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mariana fruit bats</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The University of Guam (UOG) and Guam Community College, both fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, offer courses in higher education.
