Canis is a Latin word meaning dog, and the list included the dog-like carnivores: the domestic dog, wolves, foxes and jackals. The dog was classified as Canis familiaris, which means &quot;Dog-family&quot; or the family dog. On the next page he recorded the wolf as Canis lupus, which means &quot;Dog-wolf&quot;. In 1978, a review aimed at reducing the number of recognized Canis species proposed that &quot;Canis dingo is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog. Canis familiaris is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with Canis lupus.&quot; In 1982, the first edition of Mammal Species of the World listed Canis familiaris under Canis lupus with the comment: &quot;Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, familiaris. Canis familiaris has page priority over Canis lupus, but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus (1758), and Canis lupus has been universally used for this species&quot;, which avoided classifying the wolf as the family dog.

The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death. Dogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some foods that are okay for people to eat are what to dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">toxic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Grapes, raisins, onions, garlic and what common sugar alcohol (sweetener) is toxic to dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">xylitol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of nut is poisonous to dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">macadamia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the chemical in chocolate that is poisonous to dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">theobromine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Some human foods can be what to dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">toxic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What in tobacco can hurt dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nicotine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What form of chocolate is especially toxic to dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dark</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds, and that increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e. the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Mutts, dogs that have several breed characteristics, live how much longer than purebred dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.2 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do bigger dogs typically have longer or shorter lives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shorter</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was a study done that discovered mixed breeds tend to live longer than pure breeds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Typically, how much longer do mixed breeds live?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1.2 years longer</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.

A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, &quot;Chaser&quot;, who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands. Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. A study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving experiment, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.

As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the otherwise humble domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes.

Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains.:35 The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs; the premolars and molars of wolves are much less crowded and have more complex cusp patterns. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs. Dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland, and most enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. The dog's limp ears may be the result of atrophy of the jaw muscles. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which typically has thicker skin, dogs or wolves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dogs.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dogs having ears that are not erect may be due to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">atrophy of the jaw muscles.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of features differentiate gray wolves from dogs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diagnostic features</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How often do female wolves enter estrus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">once a year.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.

These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to have an impact on the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e. selection for tameness), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of genetic traits for production, dogs are bred for what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">behaviors.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many &quot;fixed&quot; genes demonstrate the differences between the wolf and dog?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The gene differences indicate what two things done by selection in dogs during breeding for domestication?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">morphology and behavior</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the common trait selected for dogs in overall breeding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tameness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do most dogs show less of than wolves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fear and aggression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Most domestic animals were selected for what traits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">production-related traits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were dogs initially selected?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">for their behaviors.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For wolves and dogs, how many fixed genes show a variation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">11</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dogs show less fear and what as opposed to wolves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">aggression</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The global dog population is estimated at 525 million:225 based on a transparent methodology, as opposed to other estimates where the methodology has not been made available – all dog population estimates are based on regional human population densities and land uses.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the larger count for numbers of dogs considered to populate the planet?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">525 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many dogs are estimated to be in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">525 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are dog population estimates based on other than land uses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">human population densities</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Although large wild dogs, like wolves, are apex predators, they can be killed in territory disputes with wild animals.

(As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together). However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today (using the expression &quot;in the doghouse&quot; to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives, to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A grave from 12,000 BC was found to contain an older person and what else?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">puppy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two species have the most widespread bonding?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">humans and dogs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did more people begin to keep dogs as pets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">after World War II</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade showed a change in the way people kept dogs as pets?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the 1950s and 1960s most dogs where kept where?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">outside</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Historically, who in particular had dogs as companions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elites</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dogs were kept where in the 1950s and 1960s as compared to today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">outside</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the role of dogs change to be more than guardians or walking companions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs.
