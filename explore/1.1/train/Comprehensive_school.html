This is in contrast to the selective school system, where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. About 90% of British secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools. They correspond broadly to the public high school in the United States and Canada and to the German Gesamtschule.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of school does not base its admissions on academic merit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comprehensive school</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of school system uses academic success to judge admissions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">selective school system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What countries used comprehensive schools extensively?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">England and Wales</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many secondary school students attend comprehensive schools in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">90%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the German analogue of the comprehensive school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gesamtschule</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Comprehensive schools are primarily about providing an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11–16 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by Sixth Form colleges and Further Education Colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably. In addition, government initiatives such as the City Technology Colleges and Specialist schools programmes have made the comprehensive ideal less certain.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some areas of learning in comprehensive schools that were not found often in grammar schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">design and technology and vocational learning</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What two kinds of schools were developed in response to the costs of post-16 comprehensive school education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sixth Form colleges and Further Education Colleges</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which types of school projects have called the model of comprehensive schools into question?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">City Technology Colleges and Specialist schools programmes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.[citation needed] (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England). Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many selective grammar schools are still currently functioning in England and Wales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">164</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year were comprehensive schools first created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1965</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In principle, comprehensive schools were conceived as &quot;neighbourhood&quot; schools for all students in a specified catchment area.

Barbara Sommer (Christian Democratic Union), Education Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, commented that: Looking at the performance gap between comprehensives and the Gymnasium [at the Abitur central examination] [...] it is difficult to understand why the Social Democratic Party of Germany wants to do away with the Gymnasium. [...] The comprehensives do not help students achieve [...] I am sick and tired of the comprehensive schools blaming their problems on the social class origins of their students. What kind of attitude is this to blame their own students? She also called the Abitur awarded by the Gymnasium the true Abitur and the Abitur awarded by the Gesamtschule &quot;Abitur light&quot;. As a reaction, Sigrid Beer (Alliance '90/The Greens) stated that comprehensives were structurally discriminated against by the government, which favoured the Gymnasiums. She also said that many of the students awarded the Abitur by the comprehensives came from &quot;underprivileged groups&quot; and sneering at their performance was a &quot;piece of impudence&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of misconduct have comprehensive schools been alleged of engaging in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">grade inflation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which German minister criticized comprehensive schools' ability to help students succeed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barbara Sommer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which German politician defended comprehensive schools?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sigrid Beer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party does Barbara Sommer belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Christian Democratic Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which party does Sigrid Beer belong to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alliance '90/The Greens</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gesamtschulen might put bright working class students at risk according to several studies.

Some local authorities, including Sandwell and Dudley in the West Midlands, changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">By what year did the 11-plus exam mainly fall out of use?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1975</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did secondary modern and grammar schools combine to become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neighbourhood comprehensives</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Grammar schools that did not close were converted to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">comprehensive schools</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two locations in which all secondary schools were converted to comprehensives in the '70s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sandwell and Dudley</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1976 the future Labour prime minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the 'great debate' on the education system. He went on to list the areas he felt needed closest scrutiny: the case for a core curriculum, the validity and use of informal teaching methods, the role of school inspection and the future of the examination system. Comprehensive school remains the most common type of state secondary school in England, and the only type in Wales. They account for around 90% of pupils, or 64% if one does not count schools with low-level selection. This figure varies by region.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who initiated the scrutiny of the educational system in 1976?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Callaghan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only kind of school operating in Wales?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Comprehensive school</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which political party was James Callaghan a member of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Labour</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of &quot;school choice&quot; introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original &quot;neighbourhood comprehensive&quot; model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo-market incentive to encourage better schools. This logic has underpinned the controversial league tables of school performance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What law enables parents full control over their child's education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Education Reform Act</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Education Reform Act made into law?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1988</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concept does the government currently support for education?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">specialisation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Parental choice has informed what controversial practice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">league tables of school performance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Scotland has a very different educational system from England and Wales, though also based on comprehensive education.
