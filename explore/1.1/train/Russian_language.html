Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages.

Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically though an optional acute accent (знак ударения, znak udareniya) may be used to mark stress, such as to distinguish between homographic words, for example замо́к (zamok, meaning a lock) and за́мок (zamok, meaning a castle), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of phonemes are soft sounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of accent can mark stress?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">optional acute accent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of words can acute accents distinguish?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">homographic words</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What word means both lock and castle, depending on its accent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">zamok</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Russian is a Slavic language of the Indo-European family. It is a lineal descendant of the language used in Kievan Rus'. From the point of view of the spoken language, its closest relatives are Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn, the other three languages in the East Slavic group. In many places in eastern and southern Ukraine and throughout Belarus, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures, e.g. Surzhyk in eastern Ukraine and Trasianka in Belarus. An East Slavic Old Novgorod dialect, although vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common Church Slavonic influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th–20th centuries, although Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian. In the 19th century, the language was often called &quot;Great Russian&quot; to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called &quot;White Russian&quot; and Ukrainian, then called &quot;Little Russian&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language does Russian descend from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the language used in Kievan Rus'</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Russian's closest relatives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Surzhyk used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eastern Ukraine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Trasianka used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Belarus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was 'Little Russian'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ukrainian</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The vocabulary (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by Church Slavonic, a developed and partly russified form of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic language used by the Russian Orthodox Church.

In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов), Nikolai Gogol (Никола́й Го́голь), Aleksander Griboyedov (Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who revolutionized modern Russian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alexander Pushkin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Pushkin reject from older Russian?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">archaic grammar and vocabulary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was 'high style'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">archaic grammar and vocabulary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to some expressions in Pushkin's writing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the Soviet period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the official language only in 1990. Following the break-up of the USSR in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the USSR dissolve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the USSR make Russian the official language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1990</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What unofficial status did Russian have in the USSR before 1990?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the unifying role and superior status</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to figures published in 2006 in the journal &quot;Demoskop Weekly&quot; research deputy director of Research Center for Sociological Research of the Ministry of Education and Science (Russia) Arefyev A.

Arefyev published a new study &quot;Russian language at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries&quot;, in which he confirmed his conclusion about the trend of further weakening of the Russian language in all regions of the world (findings published in 2013 in the journal &quot;Demoskop Weekly&quot;). In the countries of the former Soviet Union the Russian language is gradually being replaced by local languages. Currently the number speakers of Russian language in the world depends on the number of Russians in the world (as the main sources distribution Russian language) and total population Russia (where Russian is an official language).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What department is the Research Center for Sociological Research part of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote &quot;Russian language at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A.
