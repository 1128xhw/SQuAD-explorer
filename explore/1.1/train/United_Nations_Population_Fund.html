A 2001 study conducted by the pro-life Population Research Institute (PRI) falsely claimed that the UNFPA shared an office with the Chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions. &quot;We located the family planning offices, and in that family planning office, we located the UNFPA office, and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the UNFPA does and what the Chinese Family Planning Office does,&quot; said Scott Weinberg, a spokesman for PRI. However, United Nations Members disagreed and approved UNFPA’s new country program me in January 2006. The more than 130 members of the “Group of 77” developing countries in the United Nations expressed support for the UNFPA programmes. In addition, speaking for European democracies -- Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany -- the United Kingdom stated, ”UNFPA’s activities in China, as in the rest of the world, are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted Programme of Action of the ICPD, and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor, the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.” </pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What organization found no evidence that UNFPA had supported Chinese coercion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Amnesty International</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 2001, what organization accused UNFPA of sharing office space with Chinese family planning officials?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Population Research Institute</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In January 2006, who approved UNFPA's new country programme?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">United Nations Members</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many members does the “Group of 77” have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">130</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who, speaking for the European democracies, also defended UNFPA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the United Kingdom</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>President Bush denied funding to the UNFPA.
