Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops. By the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached $16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to $56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market.

Because Herodotus had written in his Histories, Book III, 106, that in India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German Baumwolle, which translates as &quot;tree wool&quot; (Baum means &quot;tree&quot;; Wolle means &quot;wool&quot;). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. John Mandeville, writing in 1350, stated as fact the now-preposterous belief: &quot;There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungrie  [sic].&quot; (See Vegetable Lamb of Tartary.)

Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates.

Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What invention improved the cotton industry in both America and Britain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cotton gin</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What American invented the cotton gin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Eli Whitney</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Before the use of the cotton gin, how was cotton separated?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">by hand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What business development did the British use to establish a hold on the global cotton market?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">commercial chain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what source was raw cotton first bought and later resold?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">colonial markets</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated native American species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from plantations in the United States and plantations in the Caribbean. By the mid-19th century, &quot;King Cotton&quot; had become the backbone of the southern American economy.

The Egyptian government of Viceroy Isma'il took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports,[citation needed] sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's occupation by the British Empire in 1882.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What action of the Union damaged the southern cotton exports?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Union blockade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the American cotton industry fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American Civil War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what county's cotton did European buyers turn due to the American Civil War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Egyptian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What characteristic of American cotton attracted buyers after the end of the Civil war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cheap</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the abandonment of Egyptian cotton mean to the Egyptian economy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bankruptcy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after emancipation and the end of the Civil War in 1865.

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems. For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In the days of the Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the optimum amount of rainfall for cotton growth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">600 to 1,200 mm</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what soil type does cotton prefer to grow ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">heavy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why is cotton grown as an annual crop?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">control pests</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where in the US is considered the best place to grow cotton on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">South Plains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of tolerances make cotton an ideal crop for semiarid areas?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">salt and drought</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genetically modified (GM) cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To stop reliance on what was GM cotton developed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pesticides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What form of cotton is GM?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Genetically modified</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What bacterium is used to produced GM cotton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bacillus thuringiensis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What farming pest management technique does the use of GM grown plants promote?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">noninsecticide</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the life cycle of moths does Bt toxin effect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">larvae</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>But Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds. However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this. They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011. This was 69% of the worldwide total area planted in cotton.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did a research study find that the use of Bt toxin plants failed to be effective after 7 years?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2006</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what did a 2009 study conclude that increased insects were dependent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">temperature and rainfall</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did a 2012 study suggest  was halved by the use of GM plants?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pesticides</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the 2012 study say was doubled by the use of GM cotton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ladybirds, lacewings and spiders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the Earth's cotton crops are planted in GM cotton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">69%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>GM cotton acreage in India grew at a rapid rate, increasing from 50,000 hectares in 2002 to 10.6 million hectares in 2011.

A long-term study on the economic impacts of Bt cotton in India, published in the Journal PNAS in 2012, showed that Bt cotton has increased yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers. The U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton crop area of 2.6 million hectares in 2011. The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia – the yields were equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce (85% reduction). The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009 making Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the world. Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa Rica.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much area was planted in India in GM cotton in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10.6 million hectares</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the percentage of GM cotton planted in India in 2011?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">88%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Waht country has the largest area of GM cotton on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At what rank does US GM cotton stand in the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second largest</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of Australia's cotton crop was GM in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">95%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Organic cotton is generally understood as cotton from plants not genetically modified and that is certified to be grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizers or pesticides.

Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat. The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first manufactured fiber?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rayon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was rayon first made in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1890s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of industry produced a growing chain of synthetic fibers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chemicals industry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company produced nylon and acrylic in the 1930s and 1940s?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DuPont</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was manufactured completely from petrochemicals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nylon</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beginning as a self-help program in the mid-1960s, the Cotton Research and Promotion Program (CRPP) was organized by U.S. cotton producers in response to cotton's steady decline in market share.

With the passage of the Cotton Research and Promotion Act of 1966, the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton.

They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. &quot;Tetraploid&quot; means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus, referred to as the A and D genomes. The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the D-genome relative of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a wild Central American cotton species) because of its small size and limited number of repetitive elements. It is nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once.[clarification needed] The A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of G. raimondii's. Part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE). Once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties. This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively. Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the final sequencing goal of sequencing diploid cotton genomes first ?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tetraploid cotton</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of cotton has two separate genomes within its nucleus? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tetraploid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did a group of researchers decide to sequence the genomic structure of tetraploid cotton?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of genome must be sequenced first to prevent confusion before the tetraploid form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diploid</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In order to understand the tetraploid forms, what must be used as a comparison in cotton gene sequencing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">diploid counterparts</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome.
