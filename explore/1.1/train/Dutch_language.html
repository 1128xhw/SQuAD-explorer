The term was used as opposed to Latin, the non-native language of writing and the Catholic Church.

The dialects of Flanders and Brabant were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of Antwerp. In 1585 Antwerp fell to the Spanish army: many fled to the Northern Netherlands, where the Dutch Republic declared its independence from Spain. They particularly influenced the urban dialects of the province of Holland. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language, when the Statenvertaling, the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various, even Dutch Low Saxon, dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What court in Dijon prior to 1477 had a hand in standardizing Dutch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Burgundian Ducal Court</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two Dutch dialects had the greatest influence in the Middle Ages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Flanders and Brabant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which century marked great progress in Dutch standardization brought on by Antwerp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16th</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Spanish conquer Antwerp?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1585</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first Dutch Bible translation called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Statenvertaling</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Southern Netherlands (now Belgium and Luxembourg) developments were different. Under Spanish, then Austrian, and then French rule standardisation of Dutch language came to a standstill. The state, law, and increasingly education used French, yet more than half the Belgian population were speaking a Dutch dialect. In the course of the nineteenth century the Flemish movement stood up for the rights of Dutch, mostly called Flemish. But in competing with the French language the variation in dialects was a serious disadvantage. Since standardisation is a lengthy process, Dutch-speaking Belgium associated itself with the standard language that had already developed in the Netherlands over the centuries. Therefore, the situation in Belgium is essentially no different from that in the Netherlands, although there are recognisable differences in pronunciation, comparable to the pronunciation differences between standard British and standard American English. In 1980 the Netherlands and Belgium concluded the Language Union Treaty. This treaty lays down the principle that the two countries must gear their language policy to each other, among other things, for a common system of spelling.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the old name for the geographical region that's now Belgium and Luxembourg?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Southern Netherlands</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What people ruled the Southern Netherlands after the Austrians?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the Netherlands and Belgium agree on a treaty to accommodate each other's language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the treaty that brought the dialects of Belgium and the Netherlands together?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Language Union Treaty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The commonality between Dutch spoken by people in the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking Belgium can be compared to the relationship between British English and what language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">American English</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Dutch belongs to its own West Germanic sub-group, West Low Franconian, paired with its sister language Limburgish, or East Low Franconian.

Other West Germanic languages related to Dutch are German, English and the Frisian languages, and the non standardised languages Low German and Yiddish. Dutch stands out in combining a small degree of Ingvaeonic characteristics (occurring consistently in English and Frisian and reduced in intensity from 'west to east' over the continental West Germanic plane) with mostly Istvaeonic characteristics, of which some of them are also incorporated in German. Unlike German, Dutch (apart from Limburgish) has not been influenced at all by the 'south to north' movement of the High German sound shift, and had some changes of its own. The cumulation of these changes resulted over time in separate, but related standard languages with various degrees of similarities and differences between them.

As a result, when West Flemish try to talk Standard Dutch, they're often unable to pronounce the g-sound, and pronounce it similar to the h-sound. This leaves f.e. no difference between &quot;held&quot; (hero) and &quot;geld&quot; (money).

Owing to centuries of Dutch rule in Indonesia, many old documents are written in Dutch. Many universities therefore include Dutch as a source language, mainly for law and history students. In Indonesia this involves about 35,000 students.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For how long have there been Dutch speakers in Indonesia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">almost 350 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what profession is Dutch often required in the Dutch East Indies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the legal profession</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What institution in Jakarta still teaches Dutch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Erasmus Language Centre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how many pupils in all of Indonesia study Dutch as part of their coursework?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">35,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to students pursuing law degrees, what other course of study often includes Dutch?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">history</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Unlike other European nations, the Dutch chose not to follow a policy of language expansion amongst the indigenous peoples of their colonies.

In addition, many Indonesian words are calques on Dutch, for example, rumah sakit (Indonesian for &quot;hospital&quot;) is calqued on the Dutch ziekenhuis (literally &quot;house of the sick&quot;), kebun binatang (&quot;zoo&quot;) on dierentuin (literally &quot;animal garden&quot;), undang-undang dasar (&quot;constitution&quot;) from grondwet (literally &quot;ground law&quot;).

An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word voorraaddoos (food storage container). The diaeresis (Dutch: trema) is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately when involving a pre- or suffix. Whereas a hyphen is used when this problem occurs in compound words. For example; &quot;beïnvloed&quot; (influenced), but zee-eend (sea duck). Generally, other diacritical marks only occur in loanwords, though the acute accent can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms.
