However, this system has been criticized by Clifford J. Woolf and others as inadequate for guiding research and treatment. Woolf suggests three classes of pain : (1) nociceptive pain, (2) inflammatory pain which is associated with tissue damage and the infiltration of immune cells, and (3) pathological pain which is a disease state caused by damage to the nervous system or by its abnormal function (e.g. fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, tension type headache, etc.).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the IASP respond to the need to create a more useful system for describing pain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1994</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many classes of pain does the IASP system note?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who has criticized the IASP's system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Clifford J.

Pain that lasts a long time is called chronic or persistent, and pain that resolves quickly is called acute. Traditionally, the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain, though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months.:93 Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days, chronic to pain of more than six months' duration, and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months. A popular alternative definition of chronic pain, involving no arbitrarily fixed durations, is &quot;pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing&quot;.

Visceral structures are highly sensitive to stretch, ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures, such as burning and cutting. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to locate and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull. Deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fasciae and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly-localized pain. Examples include sprains and broken bones. Superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue, and is sharp, well-defined and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor (first degree) burns.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of of pain is visceral a division of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Nociceptive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of structures are sensitive to being stretched but not very sensitive to burning?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Visceral</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which type of pain is dull, aching and hard to pin-point?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Deep somatic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can visceral pain be accompanied by?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nausea and vomiting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of pain are first degree burns classified as causing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Superficial</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The prevalence of phantom pain in upper limb amputees is nearly 82%, and in lower limb amputees is 54%.

Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as &quot;a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses&quot;. Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Descartes pontificating about his theories regarding pain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1644</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Descartes think pain was?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a disturbance</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What state does the intensive theory conceive pain as being?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">emotional</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What theory perceives pain as being a specific sensation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Specificity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who migrated to the theory of specificity en mass?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">psychologists</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre> In 1955, DC Sinclair and G Weddell developed peripheral pattern theory, based on a 1934 suggestion by John Paul Nafe. They proposed that all skin fiber endings (with the exception of those innervating hair cells) are identical, and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers. Another 20th-century theory was gate control theory, introduced by Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall in the 1965 Science article &quot;Pain Mechanisms: A New Theory&quot;. The authors proposed that both thin (pain) and large diameter (touch, pressure, vibration) nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and that the more large fiber activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell, the less pain is felt. Both peripheral pattern theory and gate control theory have been superseded by more modern theories of pain[citation needed].</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was peripheral pattern theory developed? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1955</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose suggestion prompted the development of peripheral pattern theory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Paul Nafe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the gate control theory specify the diameter of which is responsible for the amount of pain sensation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nerve fibers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did DC Sinclair and G Weddell propose a property of all skin fiber endings is?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">identical</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were peripheral pattern theory and gate control theory left behind?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">superseded by more modern theories of pain</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1968 Ronald Melzack and Kenneth Casey described pain in terms of its three dimensions: &quot;sensory-discriminative&quot; (sense of the intensity, location, quality and duration of the pain), &quot;affective-motivational&quot; (unpleasantness and urge to escape the unpleasantness), and &quot;cognitive-evaluative&quot; (cognitions such as appraisal, cultural values, distraction and hypnotic suggestion). They theorized that pain intensity (the sensory discriminative dimension) and unpleasantness (the affective-motivational dimension) are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus, but &quot;higher&quot; cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness. Cognitive activities &quot;may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affective-motivational dimension. Thus, excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain, while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affective-motivational dimension and leave the sensory-discriminative dimension relatively undisturbed.&quot; (p. 432) The paper ends with a call to action: &quot;Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block, surgical intervention and the like, but also by influencing the motivational-affective and cognitive factors as well.&quot; (p. 435)</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many dimensions did Melzack and Casey describe pain in terms of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The affective-motivational dimension of pain is characterized by what urge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">urge to escape the unpleasantness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Melzack and Casey theorize could influence the perception of the magnitude of pain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cognitive activities</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">War game excitement appears to block what aspect of pain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dimensions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Melack's and Casey's paper end with a call towards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">action</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Wilhelm Erb's (1874) &quot;intensive&quot; theory, that a pain signal can be generated by intense enough stimulation of any sensory receptor, has been soundly disproved. Some sensory fibers do not differentiate between noxious and non-noxious stimuli, while others, nociceptors, respond only to noxious, high intensity stimuli. At the peripheral end of the nociceptor, noxious stimuli generate currents that, above a given threshold, begin to send signals along the nerve fiber to the spinal cord. The &quot;specificity&quot; (whether it responds to thermal, chemical or mechanical features of its environment) of a nociceptor is determined by which ion channels it expresses at its peripheral end.

Those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt. The relative intensities of pain, then, may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors (lack of food, too much cold, or serious injuries are felt as agony, whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort). This resemblance will not be perfect, however, because natural selection can be a poor designer. The result is often glitches in animals, including supernormal stimuli. Such glitches help explain pains which are not, or at least no longer directly adaptive (e.g. perhaps some forms of toothache, or injury to fingernails).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richard Dawkins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Dawkins explain must compete with each other in living begins?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drives</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would be the most fit creature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">one whose pains are well balanced</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of designer is natural selection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What might the relative intensities of pain resemble?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">risk</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with, among other factors, ethnicity, genetics, and sex.

However, like infants (Latin infans meaning &quot;unable to speak&quot;), animals cannot answer questions about whether they feel pain; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them. Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways. René Descartes for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to &quot;prove&quot; that animals are conscious, and to provide &quot;scientifically acceptable&quot; grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. The ability of invertebrate species of animals, such as insects, to feel pain and suffering is also unclear.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most reliable method of learning about pain in a human?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">asking a question</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can't animals answer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">whether they feel pain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Descartes argue animals lack?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">consciousness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What university is Bernard Rollin associated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colorado State University</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Can invertebrate species of animals like insects feel pain and suffering?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">unclear</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The presence of pain in an animal cannot be known for certain, but it can be inferred through physical and behavioral reactions.
