To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, George Washington helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal in the 18th century to bypass Richmond's rapids, with the intent of providing a water route across the Appalachians to the Kanawha River. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities of their kind in the South. The resistance to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century; in one famous case in 1848, Henry &quot;Box&quot; Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to abolitionists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, escaping slavery.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What man-made body of water was designed in part by George Washington?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James River and Kanawha Canal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To where was the canal designed by Washington intended to ferry water?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kanawha River</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what city was Henry Brown shipped as freight?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Philadelphia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Henry Brown's nickname?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Box</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of economic center was Richmond in the wake of the American Revolution?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">industrial</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 17 April 1861, five days after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the legislature voted to secede from the United States and joined the Confederacy.

After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the Confederate state legislature from meeting. Union forces killed, wounded or captured 8000 Confederate troops at Saylor's Creek southwest of Petersburg on April 6. General Lee continued to reject General Grant's surrender suggestion until Sheridan's infantry and cavalry appeared in front of his retreating army on April 8. He surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops at Appomattox Court House the following morning. Jefferson Davis retreated to North Carolina, then further south. when Lincoln rejected the surrender terms negotiated by general Sherman and envoys of North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which failed to mention slavery.

Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role, boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke in 1880/81. Contributing to Richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the United States, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. Designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current, with electric motors on the car's trucks. In Richmond, the transition from streetcars to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What mode of transportation took over from the canals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">railroads</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of railroad crossing was first built at Richmond?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">triple</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the inventor of the cigarette-rolling machine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">James Albert Bonsack</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what city did James Bonsack originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roanoke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first American trolley system powered by electricity?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Richmond Union Passenger Railway</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>By the beginning of the 20th century, the city's population had reached 85,050 in 5 square miles (13 km2), making it the most densely populated city in the Southern United States.

At the height of production in the 1890, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports.

With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Honorable Dwight C.
