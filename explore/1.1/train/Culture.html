The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago.[citation needed] This capacity is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form. Some aspects of human behavior, such as language, social practices such as kinship, gender and marriage, expressive forms such as art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies such as cooking, shelter, clothing are said to be cultural universals, found in all human societies. The concept material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including, practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science make up the intangible cultural heritage of a society.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around when were humans able to understand to some degree what culture really meant?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50,000 years ago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Name some cultural universals that exist with humans today.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">kinship, gender and marriage</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the term &quot;concept material culture&quot; cover?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">technology, architecture and art</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the humanities, one sense of culture, as an attribute of the individual, has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication, in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry.[dubious – discuss] Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a false consciousness, such perspectives common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was sometimes used or worn by early humans to form some type of culture visibly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">body modification, clothing or jewelry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Around what time did Mass Culture emerge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do some schools of philosophy suggest culture is used for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a false consciousness</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When used as a count noun &quot;a culture&quot;, is the set of customs, traditions and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation.

Samuel Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection.

These social shifts may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. feminist movement involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice age, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What changes do Social conflicts along with developing of technologies have on culture? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social dynamics and promoting new cultural models</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is this cultural movement called that involves a shift in gender relations mainly involving women?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. feminist movement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which time period was used in the example of shifts in social dynamics?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ice age</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices.

In diffusion, the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, hamburgers, fast food in the United States, seemed exotic when introduced into China. &quot;Stimulus diffusion&quot; (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. &quot;Direct Borrowing&quot; on the other hand tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another.

Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: Sapere aude, &quot;Dare to be wise!&quot; In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality.

According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups.

Another facet of the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a &quot;culture&quot; among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling social group, and low culture.

Cultural sociology was then &quot;reinvented&quot; in the English-speaking world as a product of the &quot;cultural turn&quot; of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may loosely be regarded as an approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods,[citation needed] instead hermeneutically focusing on words, artifacts and symbols. &quot;Culture&quot; has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive science. &quot;Cultural sociology&quot; is one of the largest sections of the American Sociological Association. The British establishment of cultural studies means the latter is often taught as a loosely distinct discipline in the UK.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did sociology culture stem from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Weimar Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first to refer to culture as sociology?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alfred Weber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do cultural  sociologist tend to reject as key attribute of culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">scientific methods</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like Marx, Durkheim, and Weber) with the growing discipline of anthropology, where in researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world.

As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to &quot;fit in&quot; certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Stuart Hall work along side with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Stuart and his colleagues create?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">international intellectual movement.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the field that Stuart was working, what did he and his colleagues often concentrate on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Capitalism can be referred to as what process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a process called globalization</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a text includes not only written language, but also films, photographs, fashion or hairstyles: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.[citation needed] Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of &quot;culture&quot;. &quot;Culture&quot; for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional high culture (the culture of ruling social groups) and popular culture, but also everyday meanings and practices.

This included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular culture as &quot;capitalist&quot; mass culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of the Frankfurt School critique of the &quot;culture industry&quot; (i.e. mass culture).

The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom.[citation needed] The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.[citation needed] Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, those who control the means of production (the economic base) essentially control a culture.[citation needed] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which two wrote Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Lindlof and Taylor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From a Marxist view, what did they believe had to be controlled  to essentially control a culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the economic base</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Raimon Panikkar pointed out 29 ways in which cultural change can be brought about.
