It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as &quot;The Queen's House&quot;. During the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard.

(This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to &quot;new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did King George IV originally want the structure to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a small, comfortable home</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">King William thought about converting the palace into what after a fire destroyed the Palace of Westminster in 1834?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new Houses of Parliament</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which architect helped modify the house into a palace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Nash</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Nash removed as architect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1829</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was hired in 1830 to finish the work on the palace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward Blore</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did remodeling of Buckingham House begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1762</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was George IV's original plan for the house? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a small, comfortable home</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did the king decide to make it into a palace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1826</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the main architect that transformed the house into the palace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">John Nash</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did King William IV hired to finish the work after Nash was fired?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Edward Blore</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, who was the first monarch to reside there; her predecessor William IV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when a decision was taken to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840.

The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many principle bedrooms does the palace have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">52</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bathrooms are there?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">78</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A large bow is a large feature of the facade in which stateroom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Music Room</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long is the Picture Gallery in yards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">55 yards</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which rooms has large white marble statues of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Guard Room</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the floor space of the palace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many staterooms does the palace have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">19 state rooms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many bathrooms does the palace have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">78 bathrooms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many offices does the palace have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">92 offices</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Directly underneath the State Apartments is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments.

Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World War II. The palace's state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms. 476,000 people visited the palace in the 2014–15 financial year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Buckingham Palace is actually owned by whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Crown Estate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can the public view items from the Royal Collection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen's Gallery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was located on the site that is now the Queen's Gallery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chapel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What part of the palace has been open to the public every August and September and other select dates since 1993?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The palace's state rooms</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who owns Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Crown Estate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where can the public view the Royal Collection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at the Queen's Gallery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Since when have the palaces rooms been opened to the public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">since 1993</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people visited the palace in the 2014.2015 fiscal year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">476,000 people</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Formerly, men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World War I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King George V was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the official dress code today at Buckingham Palace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">there is no official dress code</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Queen tried and failed to raise the hemline of her dress after WWI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Mary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which King was horrified to see the Queen's hemline raised a few inches?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King George V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The hemline of daytime skirts were allowed to rise after which year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1936</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The knee breeches men formerly wore to the palace were of what era's design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th-century design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what century were men's knee breeches worn at Buckingham designed in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th-century design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were women obliged to wear in their hair?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">tiaras or feathers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which queen wanted to shorten her skirt's hemline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Mary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which King was horrified to see the raised hemline on the Queen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the dress code today at Buckingham?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">there is no official dress code</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under whose reign did the last major building works take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King George V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The principle facade of the East Front is made from what type of stone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portland stone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which king preferred official entertaining and royal duties to lavish parties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who added and restored furniture to The Royal Collection?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Mary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for decorating The Blue Drawing Room?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Mary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sir Aston Webb</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The refaced facade was made from what type of stone?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portland stone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which king placed more emphasis on official entertaining and royal duties instead of lavish parties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George V</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What collection did Queen Mary take an interest in by adding and restoring pieces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Collection of furniture and art</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who decorated the Blue Drawing Room?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Queen Mary</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During World War I, the palace, then the home of King George V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who lived at Buckingham Palace during WWI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King George V and Queen Mary</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were valuable items from Buckingham Palace taken during WWI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Windsor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The king refrained from doing what during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alcohol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the north-west pavilion turned into a swimming pool?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1938</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who persuaded the king to lock the wine cellars during WWI?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Lloyd George</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Buckingham Palace was untouched during which war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">World War I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were valuables evacuated to during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Windsor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the King give up during the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">alcohol</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who convinced the king to lock the wine cellars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">David Lloyd George</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the north-west pavilion converted into in 1938?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">swimming pool</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During World War II, the palace was bombed nine times, the most serious and publicised of which resulted in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed. War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: &quot;I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the face&quot;. The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as The Sunday Graphic reported:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was the palace bombed in WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nine times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was destroyed in 1940?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the palace chapel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which monarchs were in residence at Buckingham Palace during WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The bombing of Buckingham Palace showed what to the public?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the common suffering of rich and poor</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was destroyed in one of the bombing that hit the palace in WWII?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the chapel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The King and Queen were filmed doing what after a bombing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inspecting their bombed home</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The royal family was seen as sharing what with their subjects after the bombings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their subjects' hardship</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 15 September 1940, known as the Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British pilot became a King's Messenger after the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the date of the Battle of Britain Day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 September 1940</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ray Holmes think the German pilot was going to bomb?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Palace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of airplane was the German craft Holmes rammed into?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dornier Do 17 bomber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After the war what did Holmes become?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King's Messenger</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Ray Holmes die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is September 15, 1940 known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Battle of Britain Day</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Ray Holmes believe the German pilot was targeting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Palace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Holmes do to stop the German Plane?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ram it</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of aircraft was the German Plane?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dornier Do 17 bomber</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Holmes die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
