Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises. When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be in amity, and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons why one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concept determines relationships between Grand Lodges?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Recognition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What must two lodges be in, in order to inter-visit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">amity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What, besides Recognition, must happen between two Grand Lodges in order for them to be considered in amity? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Masonic communication</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What can be causes of one Grand Lodge withdrawing Recognition from another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the members of a Grand Lodge called?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">brethren</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Gran Lodges are in what when they are in Masonic Communication with each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">amity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What concept is used to determine relations between Grand Lodges?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Recognition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does each Grand Lodge maintain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a list</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is not allowed when Grand Lodges are not in amity? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inter-visitation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two most common reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold recognition from another?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 to the beginning of the 18th century.

The new constitutions read, &quot;Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity&quot;, the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out. It is possible that the immediate objections of the United Grand Lodge of England were at least partly motivated by the political tension between France and Britain at the time.

Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are some Protestant objections to Freemasonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Catholic objections to Freemasonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">rationalism and naturalism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is generally accepted as the voice of Freemasonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">No one voice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who do the Protestant anti-Masons believe is the absolute authority on the use of mysticism, Satanism and occultism in Freemasonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albert Pike</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Albert Pike actually more of an expert in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion alleged Freemasons as Satanic?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Protestant</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religion alleged Freemasons as unnatural and irrational? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was controversial among Freemasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Albert Pike</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who has spoke for all Freemasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">No one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Albert Pike's opinions were grounded in what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1799, English Freemasonry almost came to a halt due to Parliamentary proclamation. In the wake of the French Revolution, the Unlawful Societies Act 1799 banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation. The Grand Masters of both the Moderns and the Antients Grand Lodges called on Prime Minister William Pitt (who was not a Freemason) and explained to him that Freemasonry was a supporter of the law and lawfully constituted authority and was much involved in charitable work. As a result, Freemasonry was specifically exempted from the terms of the Act, provided that each private lodge's Secretary placed with the local &quot;Clerk of the Peace&quot; a list of the members of his lodge once a year. This continued until 1967 when the obligation of the provision was rescinded by Parliament.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What put English Freemasonry at risk?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parliamentary proclamation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Unlawful Socities Act ban?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">meetings of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Unlawful Socities Act implemented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1799</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was each private lodge required to provide to the Clerk of Peace every year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a list of the members of his lodge</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Grand Masters call upon to explain that Freemasonry was not an unlawful society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prime Minister William Pitt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">English Freemasonry almost came to a halt in what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1799</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did English Freemasonry almost come to a halt in 1799?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Parliamentary proclamation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What act was made in 1799 banning any meeting of groups that had to take an oath or obligation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Unlawful Societies Act 1799</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who gave the Freemasons an exemption of the Act of 1799?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prime Minister William Pitt</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did parliament rescind the exemption of 1799 given to the Freemasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1967</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In some countries anti-Masonry is often related to antisemitism and anti-Zionism.

In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips peculiar to his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge. In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do most masonic rituals consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">degree ceremonies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the first degree of Masonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Entered Apprentice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the second degree of Masonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Fellowcraft</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the final degree of Masonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Master Mason</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What things come with each new degree in Freemasonry?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">passwords, signs and grips</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The bulk of Masonic rituals consist of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">degree ceremonies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What comes after the degree of Entered Apprentice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the degree of Fellowcraft</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the first of degree ceremonies?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the degree of Entered Apprentice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the final degree in the Freemasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the degree of Master Mason</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What annual ceremony do Freemasons have?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>English Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, and then as distinctively French lodges which still follow the ritual of the Moderns.

In 1775, an African-American named Prince Hall, along with fourteen other African-Americans, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston. When the military Lodge left North America, those fifteen men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the UGLE was formed in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls – due largely to the War of 1812. Thus, separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge re-titled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1 – and became a de facto &quot;Grand Lodge&quot; (this Lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges on the Continent of Africa).

Unlike its predecessor, the 1983 Code of Canon Law did not explicitly name Masonic orders among the secret societies it condemns. It states: &quot;A person who joins an association which plots against the Church is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an interdict.&quot; This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons to believe that the ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation of Vatican II. However, the matter was clarified when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Declaration on Masonic Associations, which states: &quot;... the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden.

In the UK, Masons working in the justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found that there has been no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Judges and police officers had to disclose their Freemason membership in what years in England?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">from 1999 to 2009</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who ended the English Masonic disclosure policy in 2009?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Justice Secretary Jack Straw</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Justice Secretary Jack Straw ended the Masonic disclosure law on what grounds?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the rule was considered disproportionate</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Masonic Lodge is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.

In the past, few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practicing Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What English Archbishop was a member of the Freemasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geoffrey Fisher</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What former Archbishop of Canterbury has reservations about the Freemasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dr Rowan Williams</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Dr. Rowan Williams apologize to the Freemasons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Dr. Rowan Williams was also Bishop of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bishop of Monmouth</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Italy, Freemasonry has become linked to a scandal concerning the Propaganda Due lodge (a.k.a.
