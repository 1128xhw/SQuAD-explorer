A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product, and is the molecular unit of heredity.:Glossary The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a gene?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the basis of inheritance of phenotypic traits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What influence are most biological traits under?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">polygenes (many different genes)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one instantly visible genetic trait?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">eye colour or number of limbs</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one invisible genetic trait?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population.

From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who first suggested the existence of discrete inheritable units?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gregor Mendel (1822–1884)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If a distinct trait in edible pea plants is mathematically described as a 2n combination, what does n represent? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one thing that Gregor Mendel was the first to demonstrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">independent assortment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another thing that Gregor Mendel was the first to demonstrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the distinction between dominant and recessive traits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Gregor Mendel explain his results in terms of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prior to Mendel's work, the dominant theory of heredity was one of blending inheritance, which suggested that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that the traits of the parents blended and mixed to produce the offspring.

The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish a model of the double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication. Collectively, this body of research established the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA.

In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere.:4.2 Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process.

Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.:7</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does transcription produce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does the nucleotide sequence of mRNA compare to DNA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">complementary to the DNA from which it was transcribed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used as a template to generate a complementary mRNA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The gene's DNA</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why does the mRNA match the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the enzyme called that performs transcription?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">an RNA polymerase</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In prokaryotes, transcription occurs in the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5' end of the RNA while the 3' end is still being transcribed.

One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins.

The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus.
