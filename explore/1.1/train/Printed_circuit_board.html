There are two types of panels: assembly panels - often called arrays - and bare board manufacturing panels. The assemblers often mount components on panels rather than single PCBs because this is efficient. The bare board manufactures always uses panels, not only for efficiency, but because of the requirements the plating process.

In additive methods the pattern is electroplated onto a bare substrate using a complex process. The advantage of the additive method is that less material is needed and less waste is produced. In the full additive process the bare laminate is covered with a photosensitive film which is imaged (exposed to light through a mask and then developed which removes the unexposed film). The exposed areas are sensitized in a chemical bath, usually containing palladium and similar to that used for through hole plating which makes the exposed area capable of bonding metal ions. The laminate is then plated with copper in the sensitized areas. When the mask is stripped, the PCB is finished.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Do additive or subtractive methods use less raw materials?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">additive</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What object is used to expose selected parts of the photosensitive film to light?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mask</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What chemical element is often present in the bath used to sensitive exposed film after it's been imaged?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">palladium</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In subtractive methods, what metal covers the board and is then partially removed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">copper</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the additive method, which parts of the laminate are plated with copper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sensitized areas</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Semi-additive is the most common process: The unpatterned board has a thin layer of copper already on it.

Additional copper is then plated onto the board in the unmasked areas; copper may be plated to any desired weight. Tin-lead or other surface platings are then applied. The mask is stripped away and a brief etching step removes the now-exposed bare original copper laminate from the board, isolating the individual traces. Some single-sided boards which have plated-through holes are made in this way.

In bubble etching, air is passed through the etchant bath to agitate the solution and speed up etching. Splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching. In spray etching, the etchant solution is distributed over the boards by nozzles, and recirculated by pumps.

These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma.

Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by hot air solder levelling (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a tin-lead alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the RoHS directive in the EU and US, which restricts the use of lead.

For small or medium volume production flying probe testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands.

Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. Some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did surface-mount become a commonly used manufacturing process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the new components with end tabs replace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wire leads</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What improvement is possible with surface-mounting that enables higher production and lower labor costs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">automation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are SMDs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">surface mount devices</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is it the chip or the package that influences the price of an SMD more?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">chip</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching.

IPC 2152 is a standard for determining current-carrying capacity of printed circuit board traces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What's the minimum amount of copper a layer in a PCB can have to be considered &quot;heavy copper&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three ounces</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">About how thick would a PCB layer be if it contained three oz. of copper?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">0.0042 inches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What will a circuit board with heavy copper carry very well?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">current</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What would a PCB designer use heavy copper to make their circuit board resist?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">thermal strains</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the heat go when it leaves heavy copper-plated vias?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">external heat sinks</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since it was quite easy to stack interconnections (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other—which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What arduous aspect of the process can designers skip in Multiwire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">routing of wires</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the machine create by drawing a straight line between two points on the board?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a connection</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with quick design times, what problem does Multiwire cut down on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">crosstalk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What makes Multiwire impractical to use when large quantities of a board are needed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">cost</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In simple language, what are the interconnections in an embedding matrix?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wires</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space was at a premium (such as missile guidance and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads. To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of construction is best for applications that need to portion space carefully?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cordwood</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What gets mounted in the middle of two parallel planes in a cordwood construction?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">axial-leaded components</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of component has to be used in cordwood construction to its detriment?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nickel-leaded</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do insulating cards prevent between interconnection layers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">shorting</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What force caused the physical damage to components that affected the Apollo program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Differential thermal expansion</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Development of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards started early in the 20th century.

The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What company developed the first electronic circuit that could be mass produced and was durable enough to be fired from a gun?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Globe Union</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was in charge of the Centralab Division of Globe Union when the PCB used in anti-aircraft fuses was invented?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Harry W.

The components' leads were then passed through the holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of construction was originally used for all electronic components?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through-hole</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Auto-Sembly process created?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the patent for the Auto-Sembly process granted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1956</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Although two men developed the Auto-Sembly process, to whom was the patent officially granted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U.S. Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the Auto-Sembly manufacturing process is the most costly?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">drilling holes</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
