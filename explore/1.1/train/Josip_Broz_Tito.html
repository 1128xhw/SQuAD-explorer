During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian, and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito was &quot;seen by most as a benevolent dictator&quot; due to his economic and diplomatic policies. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Josip Broz Tito die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During World War II what resistance movement did he lead?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Partisans,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For what country is Tito viewed as  unifying figure?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yugoslavia</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the Non-Aligned Movement, which Egyptian leader did Tito work with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gamal Abdel Nasser</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the Non-Aligned Movement, which Indonesian leader did Tito work with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sukarno</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>He was General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (1939–80), and went on to lead the World War II Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the Partisans (1941–45).

Despite being one of the founders of Cominform, soon he became the first Cominform member to defy Soviet hegemony and the only one to manage to leave Cominform and begin with its own socialist program. Tito was a backer of independent roads to socialism (sometimes referred to as &quot;national communism&quot;). In 1951 he implemented a self-management system that differentiated Yugoslavia from other socialist countries. A turn towards a model of market socialism brought economic expansion in the 1950s and 1960s and a decline during the 1970s. His internal policies included the suppression of nationalist sentiment and the promotion of the &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot; of the six Yugoslav nations. After Tito's death in 1980, tensions between the Yugoslav republics emerged and in 1991 the country disintegrated and went into a series of wars and unrest that lasted the rest of the decade, and which continue to impact most of the former Yugoslav republics. He remains a very controversial figure in the Balkans.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the second Yugoslavia start?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1943</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What group did Tito found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cominform</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Tito implement a self-management system that differentiated Yugoslavia from other socialist coutnries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1951</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Tito die?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Yugoslavia disintegrate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1991</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Josip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in Kumrovec, in the northern Croatian region of Hrvatsko Zagorje in Austria-Hungary.[nb 1] He was the seventh child of Franjo and Marija Broz. His father, Franjo Broz (26 November 1860 – 16 December 1936), was a Croat, while his mother Marija (25 March 1864 – 14 January 1918), was a Slovene. His parents were married on 21 January 1891. After spending part of his childhood years with his maternal grandfather Martin Javeršek in the Slovenian village of Podsreda, he entered primary school in 1900 at Kumrovec, he failed the 2nd grade and graduated in 1905. In 1907 he moved out of the rural environment and started working as a machinist's apprentice in Sisak. There, he became aware of the labour movement and celebrated 1 May – Labour Day for the first time. In 1910, he joined the union of metallurgy workers and at the same time the Social-Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia. Between 1911 and 1913, Broz worked for shorter periods in Kamnik (1911–1912, factory &quot;Titan&quot;), Cenkov, Munich and Mannheim, where he worked for the Benz car factory; then he went to Wiener Neustadt, Austria, and worked as a test driver for Daimler.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Josip Broz born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kumrovec</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Broz born?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1892</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ethnicity was Broz's father?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Croat</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What ethnicity was Broz's mother?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Slovene</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What grade did he fail?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2nd</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the autumn of 1913, he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army.

In April 1917, he was arrested again but managed to escape and participate in the July Days demonstrations in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) on 16–17 July 1917. On his way to Finland, Broz was caught and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress for three weeks. He was again sent to Kungur, but escaped from the train. He hid with a Russian family in Omsk, Siberia where he met his future wife Pelagija Belousova. After the October Revolution, he joined a Red Guard unit in Omsk. Following a White counteroffensive, he fled to Kirgiziya and subsequently returned to Omsk, where he married Belousova.

Upon his return, Broz joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The CPY's influence on the political life of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was growing rapidly. In the 1920 elections the Communists won 59 seats in the parliament and became the third strongest party. Winning numerous local elections, they gained a stronghold in the second largest city of Zagreb, electing Svetozar Delić for mayor. After the assassination of Milorad Drašković, the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, by a young communist on 2 August 1921, the CPY was declared illegal under the Yugoslav State Security Act of 1921. During 1920 and 1921 all Communist-won mandates were nullified. Broz continued his work underground despite pressure on Communists from the government. As 1921 began he moved to Veliko Trojstvo near Bjelovar and found work as a machinist. In 1925, Broz moved to Kraljevica where he started working at a shipyard. He was elected as a union leader and a year later he led a shipyard strike. He was fired and moved to Belgrade, where he worked in a train coach factory in Smederevska Palanka. He was elected as Workers' Commissary but was fired as soon as his CPY membership was revealed. Broz then moved to Zagreb, where he was appointed secretary of Metal Workers' Union of Croatia. In 1928, he became the Zagreb Branch Secretary of the CPY. In the same year he was arrested, tried in court for his illegal communist activities, and sent to jail. During his five years at Lepoglava prison he met Moša Pijade, who became his ideological mentor. After his release, he lived incognito and assumed numerous noms de guerre, among them &quot;Walter&quot; and &quot;Tito&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many seats did the Communists win in 1920 Yugoslavia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">59</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was elected mayor of Zagreb after the Communists won 59 parliamentary seats?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Svetozar Delić</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Broz move in 1921?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Veliko Trojstvo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was he in prison at Lepoglava for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who became his ideological mentor in prison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Moša Pijade,</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1934 the Zagreb Provincial Committee sent Tito to Vienna where all the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia had sought refuge.

In 1935, Tito travelled to the Soviet Union, working for a year in the Balkans section of Comintern. He was a member of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet secret police (NKVD). Tito was also involved in recruiting for the Dimitrov Battalion, a group of volunteers serving in the Spanish Civil War. In 1936, the Comintern sent &quot;Comrade Walter&quot; (i.e. Tito) back to Yugoslavia to purge the Communist Party there.

Tito was named President of the National Committee of Liberation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Partisans create the First Proletarian Brigade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1941</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Tito create the Second Proletarian Brigade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1942</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What position was Tito named to for the National Committee of LIberation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">President</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the 67-member &quot;presidency&quot; located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jajce</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many members were in the &quot;presidency&quot; in Jajce?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">67</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the growing possibility of an Allied invasion in the Balkans, the Axis began to divert more resources to the destruction of the Partisans main force and its high command.

This government was headed by Tito as provisional Yugoslav Prime Minister and included representatives from the royalist government-in-exile, among others Ivan Šubašić. In accordance with the agreement between resistance leaders and the government-in-exile, post-war elections were held to determine the form of government. In November 1945, Tito's pro-republican People's Front, led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, won the elections with an overwhelming majority, the vote having been boycotted by monarchists. During the period, Tito evidently enjoyed massive popular support due to being generally viewed by the populace as the liberator of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav administration in the immediate post-war period managed to unite a country that had been severely affected by ultra-nationalist upheavals and war devastation, while successfully suppressing the nationalist sentiments of the various nations in favor of tolerance, and the common Yugoslav goal. After the overwhelming electoral victory, Tito was confirmed as the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the DFY. The country was soon renamed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (FPRY) (later finally renamed into Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, SFRY). On 29 November 1945, King Peter II was formally deposed by the Yugoslav Constituent Assembly. The Assembly drafted a new republican constitution soon afterwards.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the provisional government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia assembled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Belgrade</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the provisional government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia assembled?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7 March 1945</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who Where assembled the provisional government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tito</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was seen as the liberator of Yugoslavia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tito</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was formally deposed by the Yugoslav Constitutent Assembly on November 29, 1945?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">King Peter II</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Yugoslavia organized the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslavenska narodna armija, or JNA) from the Partisan movement and became the fourth strongest army in Europe at the time.

This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on US transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the west. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.[better source needed] Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when US had operational nuclear weapons whereas USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the Greek Civil War, while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council.

However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the Cominform, fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier.

The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; 'I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,' Stalin remarked. The expulsion effectively banished Yugoslavia from the international association of socialist states, while other socialist states of Eastern Europe subsequently underwent purges of alleged &quot;Titoists&quot;.

The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislature independently from the Communist Party. Džemal Bijedić was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralize the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defense, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions. Control of education, healthcare, and housing would be exercised entirely by the governments of the republics and the autonomous provinces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was Tito reelected president of Yugoslavia for the sixth time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1971</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who elected Tito president in 1971?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Federal Assembly</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many sweeping constitutional amendments did Tito introduce in 1971?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">20</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was chosen as a premier in 1971 in Yugoslavia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bijedić</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What branch of the Yugoslav government would retain control over foreign affairs, defense and internal security?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">federal</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tito's greatest strength, in the eyes of the western communists, had been in suppressing nationalist insurrections and maintaining unity throughout the country.

This ability was put to a test several times during his reign, notably during the Croatian Spring (also referred as the Masovni pokret, maspok, meaning &quot;Mass Movement&quot;) when the government suppressed both public demonstrations and dissenting opinions within the Communist Party. Despite this suppression, much of maspok's demands were later realized with the new constitution, heavily backed by Tito himself against opposition from the Serbian branch of the party.[citation needed] On 16 May 1974, the new Constitution was passed, and the aging Tito was named president for life, a status which he would enjoy for five years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What person's calls for unity is credited by western communists of holding together Yugoslavia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tito</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was referred to as the &quot;Mass Movement&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Croatian Spring</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was the new Yugoslavian constitution passed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16 May 1974</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was named President for Life of Yugoslavia in 1974?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tito</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did the person named &quot;president for life&quot; serve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">five years.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tito's visits to the United States avoided most of the Northeast due to large minorities of Yugoslav emigrants bitter about communism in Yugoslavia.

Several of these places have since returned to their original names, such as Podgorica, formerly Titograd (though Podgorica's international airport is still identified by the code TGD), and Užice, formerly Titovo Užice, which reverted to its original name in 1992. Streets in Belgrade, the capital, have all reverted to their original pre–World War II and pre-communist names as well. In 2004, Antun Augustinčić's statue of Broz in his birthplace of Kumrovec was decapitated in an explosion. It was subsequently repaired. Twice in 2008, protests took place in Zagreb's Marshal Tito Square, organized by a group called Circle for the Square (Krug za Trg), with an aim to force the city government to rename it to its previous name, while a counter-protest by Citizens' Initiative Against Ustašism (Građanska inicijativa protiv ustaštva) accused the &quot;Circle for the Square&quot; of historical revisionism and neo-fascism. Croatian president Stjepan Mesić criticized the demonstration to change the name. In the Croatian coastal city of Opatija the main street (also its longest street) still bears the name of Marshal Tito, as do streets in numerous towns in Serbia, mostly in the country's north. One of the main streets in downtown Sarajevo is called Marshal Tito Street, and Tito's statue in a park in front of the university campus (ex. JNA barrack &quot;Maršal Tito&quot;) in Marijin Dvor is a place where Bosnians and Sarajevans still today commemorate and pay tribute to Tito (image on the right). The largest Tito monument in the world, about 10 m (33 ft) high, is located at Tito Square (Slovene: Titov trg), the central square in Velenje, Slovenia. One of the main bridges in Slovenia's second largest city of Maribor is Tito Bridge (Titov most).

Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief Aleksandar Ranković as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito, objecting to her energetic personality, opted for the more mature opera singer Zinka Kunc instead. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at Beli Dvor, where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after Tito's strange relationship with Zinka failed. Since Jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power, she also went down in history as Yugoslavia's first lady. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair.
