The Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 gave Germany most of Alsace and some parts of Lorraine, which became the Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen).The German conquest of France and the unification of Germany upset the European balance of power, that had existed since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and Otto von Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades. French determination to regain Alsace-Lorraine and fear of another Franco-German war, along with British apprehension about the balance of power, became factors in the causes of World War I.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under what Prussian king did the German empire unite as a nation-state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wilhelm I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date of the Treaty of Frankfurt?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10 May 1871</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Treaty of Frankfurt gave Germany which Imperial territory?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Alsace-Lorraine</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Following the unification of Germany, who maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Otto von Bismarck</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which specific fear was a factor in causing World War I?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">another Franco-German war</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Ems telegram had exactly the effect on French public opinion that Bismarck had intended. &quot;This text produced the effect of a red flag on the Gallic bull&quot;, Bismarck later wrote.

The leader of the monarchists in Parliament, Adolphe Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon's new prime minister, Emile Ollivier, declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honorably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility &quot;with a light heart.&quot; A crowd of 15–20,000 people, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war. On 19 July 1870 a declaration of war was sent to the Prussian government.

The deficiencies of the needle gun were more than compensated for by the famous Krupp 6-pounder (3 kg) steel breech-loading cannons being issued to Prussian artillery batteries. Firing a contact-detonated shell, the Krupp gun had a longer range and a higher rate of fire than the French bronze muzzle loading cannon, which relied on faulty time fuses.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which battle did the Dreyse needle gun gain its fame?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Königgrätz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the start of the Franco-Prussian War, what was the age of the Dreyse gun's design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25-year-old design</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Dreyse rifle's tactical range?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">600 m (2,000 ft)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the famous cannon issued to Prussian soldiers at the time?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Krupp</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of shell did the Krupp weapon fire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a contact-detonated shell</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870.

During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date of the first action of the Franco-Prussian War?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">4 August 1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On that date, which elements were assisted by Prussian artillery forces?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bavarian and two Prussian corps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who initially held a strong position during the battle at the border? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Douay of I Corps</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Douay's initial success was credited by what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">long-range fire of the Chassepots</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What threatened the French avenue of retreat?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the encirclement of the town by the Prussians</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The French were unaware of German numerical superiority at the beginning of the battle as the German 2nd Army did not attack all at once. Treating the oncoming attacks as merely skirmishes, Frossard did not request additional support from other units. By the time he realized what kind of a force he was opposing, it was too late. Seriously flawed communications between Frossard and those in reserve under Bazaine slowed down so much that by the time the reserves received orders to move out to Spicheren, German soldiers from the 1st and 2nd armies had charged up the heights. Because the reserves had not arrived, Frossard erroneously believed that he was in grave danger of being outflanked as German soldiers under General von Glume were spotted in Forbach. Instead of continuing to defend the heights, by the close of battle after dusk he retreated to the south. The German casualties were relatively high due to the advance and the effectiveness of the chassepot rifle. They were quite startled in the morning when they had found out that their efforts were not in vain—Frossard had abandoned his position on the heights.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factor were the French unaware of at the start of the battle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">German numerical superiority</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which French commander miscalculated the severity of the battle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frossard</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a key factor in Frossard's disasterous retreat to the south?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Seriously flawed communications</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factor was credited to the large number of German casualties?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">effectiveness of the chassepot rifle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What outcome surprised the Germans the following day?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Frossard had abandoned his position</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Battle of Gravelotte, or Gravelotte–St. Privat (18 August), was the largest battle during the Franco-Prussian War.

The combined German forces, under Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, were the Prussian First and Second Armies of the North German Confederation numbering about 210 infantry battalions, 133 cavalry squadrons, and 732 heavy cannons totaling 188,332 officers and men. The French Army of the Rhine, commanded by Marshal François-Achille Bazaine, numbering about 183 infantry battalions, 104 cavalry squadrons, backed by 520 heavy cannons, totaling 112,800 officers and men, dug in along high ground with their southern left flank at the town of Rozerieulles, and their northern right flank at St. Privat.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On which date was the Battle of Gravelotte?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18 August</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which battle was considered the biggest in the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Battle of Gravelotte</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the location of the Battle of Gravelotte? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">6 miles (9.7 km) west of Metz</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under which Field Marshall were the combined German forces commanded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Count Helmuth von Moltke</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commanded the French Army of the Rhine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marshal François-Achille Bazaine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the defeat of Marshal Bazaine's Army of the Rhine at Gravelotte, the French were forced to retire to Metz, where they were besieged by over 150,000 Prussian troops of the First and Second Armies. Napoleon III and MacMahon formed the new French Army of Châlons, to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine. Napoleon III personally led the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance. The Army of Châlons marched northeast towards the Belgian border to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine. The Prussians, under the command of Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, took advantage of this maneuver to catch the French in a pincer grip. He left the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz, except three corps detached to form the Army of the Meuse under the Crown Prince of Saxony. With this army and the Prussian Third Army, Moltke marched northward and caught up with the French at Beaumont on 30 August. After a sharp fight in which they lost 5,000 men and 40 cannons, the French withdrew toward Sedan. Having reformed in the town, the Army of Châlons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies. Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately. With MacMahon wounded on the previous day, General Auguste Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What factor forced the French to retreat to Metz?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the defeat of Marshal Bazaine's Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At Metz, what was the approximate number of Prussian troops?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 150,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who formed the new French Army of Chalons?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Napoleon III and MacMahon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Army of the Meuse, what other army did Moltke march north with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Prussian Third Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many casualties did Moltke suffer at Beaumont?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">5,000 men</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>When the war had begun, European public opinion heavily favored the Germans; many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in Florence and a Prussian diplomat visited Giuseppe Garibaldi in Caprera.

The French were forced to abandon Orléans on 4 December, and were finally defeated at the Battle of Le Mans (10–12 January).

President Trochu resigned on 25 January and was replaced by Favre, who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight. Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter's arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight. At Tours, Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed. A delegation of Parisian diplomats arrived in Tours by train on 5 February to negotiate with Gambetta, and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was public opinion in Paris strongly opposed to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">any form of surrender</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did president Trochu resign?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">25 January</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who replaced President Trochu?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Favre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which French city was the surrender made official?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Versailles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who disregarded the surrender and launched a failed attack on the Germans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gambetta</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The quick German victory over the French stunned neutral observers, many of whom had expected a French victory and most of whom had expected a long war.

Von Bredow's attack had succeeded only because of an unusually effective artillery bombardment just before the charge, along with favorable terrain that masked his approach.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commanded the Prussian 12 Cavalry Brigade?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Adalbert von Bredow</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did General von Bredow lead a charge against at the Battle of Mars-la-Tour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a French artillery battery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did von Bredow's Pyrrhic victory become known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">von Bredow's Death Ride</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What military tactic proved to be unsuccessful on the 1914 battlefields?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Use of traditional cavalry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of two factors that led von Bredow's narrow success on the battlefield?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">favorable terrain that masked his approach</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Prussian province of Posen, with a large Polish population, there was strong support for the French and angry demonstrations at news of Prussian-German victories—a clear manifestation of Polish nationalist feeling.

An alarming report on the Posen situation, sent to Bismarck on 16 August 1870, led to the quartering of reserve troop contingents in the restive province. The Franco-Prussian War thus turned out to be a significant event also in German–Polish relations, marking the beginning of a prolonged period of repressive measures by the authorities and efforts at Germanisation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which Prussian province did a large Polish population reside?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Posen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was there strong support of in Posen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What calls were made for the Polish recruits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to desert from the Prussian Army</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did Bismarkck receive the disturbing report on the Posen situation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">16 August 1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What significant consequence was a result of German-Polish relations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prolonged period of repressive measures</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The causes of the Franco-Prussian War are deeply rooted in the events surrounding the unification of Germany. In the aftermath of the Austro–Prussian War of 1866, Prussia had annexed numerous territories and formed the North German Confederation. This new power destabilized the European balance of power established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon III, then the emperor of France, demanded compensations in Belgium and on the left bank of the Rhine to secure France's strategic position, which the Prussian chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, flatly refused. Prussia then turned its attention towards the south of Germany, where it sought to incorporate the southern German kingdoms, Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt, into a unified Prussia-dominated Germany. France was strongly opposed to any further alliance of German states, which would have significantly strengthened the Prussian military.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the causes of the Franco-Prussian War deeply rooted in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the unification of Germany</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian war, formed what group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North German Confederation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the effect of that new group on the European balance of power?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">new power destabilized</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What established the European balance of power in 1815?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Congress of Vienna</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As Prussia sought to incorporated several German kingdoms, what stance did France assume?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">strongly opposed to any further alliance of German states</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The French Army consisted in peacetime of approximately 400,000 soldiers, some of them regulars, others conscripts who until 1869 served the comparatively long period of seven years with the colours. Some of them were veterans of previous French campaigns in the Crimean War, Algeria, the Franco-Austrian War in Italy, and in the Franco-Mexican War. However, following the &quot;Seven Weeks War&quot; between Prussia and Austria four years earlier, it had been calculated that the French Army could field only 288,000 men to face the Prussian Army when perhaps 1,000,000 would be required. Under Marshal Adolphe Niel, urgent reforms were made. Universal conscription (rather than by ballot, as previously) and a shorter period of service gave increased numbers of reservists, who would swell the army to a planned strength of 800,000 on mobilisation. Those who for any reason were not conscripted were to be enrolled in the Garde Mobile, a militia with a nominal strength of 400,000. However, the Franco-Prussian War broke out before these reforms could be completely implemented. The mobilisation of reservists was chaotic and resulted in large numbers of stragglers, while the Garde Mobile were generally untrained and often mutinous.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In peacetime, what the approximate number of French soldiers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">400,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Veterans of the French Army had prviously fought in which war in Italy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Franco-Austrian War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The &quot;Seven Weeks War&quot; was between which two countries?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prussia and Austria</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who reformed the low numbers of troops by implementing universal conscription?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Marshal Adolphe Niel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">If a citizen was for some reason not conscripted, in what militia were they were registered?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Garde Mobile</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Prussian army was controlled by the General Staff, under Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke.

However the Prussians resisted strongly, and the French suffered 86 casualties to the Prussian 83 casualties. Saarbrücken also proved to be a major obstacle in terms of logistics. Only one railway there led to the German hinterland but could be easily defended by a single force, and the only river systems in the region ran along the border instead of inland.

Napoleon and his Prime Minister, Émile Ollivier, for their parts sought war to solve their problems with political disunity in France. On 16 July 1870, the French parliament voted to declare war on the German Kingdom of Prussia and hostilities began three days later.

French tactics emphasised the defensive use of the Chassepot rifle in trench-warfare style fighting—the so-called feu de bataillon. The artillery was equipped with rifled, muzzle-loaded La Hitte guns. The army also possessed a precursor to the machine-gun: the mitrailleuse, which could unleash significant, concentrated firepower but nevertheless lacked range and was comparatively immobile, and thus prone to being easily overrun. The mitrailleuse was mounted on an artillery gun carriage and grouped in batteries in a similar fashion to cannon.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What modern, mass-produced weapon were the French infantry provided?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chassepot rifle</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the maximum effective range of the Chassepot rifle?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1,500 metres (4,900 ft)</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which type of warfare did the French best utilize the Chassepot?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">trench-warfare</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What precedent of the machine gun did the French troops also possess?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mitrailleuse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what was the mitrailleuse mounted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">on an artillery gun carriage</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 1 September 1870, the battle opened with the Army of Châlons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies totaling 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Marguerite was killed leading the very first charge and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses. By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking out, Napoleon III called off the attacks. The French lost over 17,000 men, killed or wounded, with 21,000 captured. The Prussians reported their losses at 2,320 killed, 5,980 wounded and 700 captured or missing. By the next day, on 2 September, Napoleon III surrendered and was taken prisoner with 104,000 of his soldiers. It was an overwhelming victory for the Prussians, for they not only captured an entire French army, but the leader of France as well. The defeat of the French at Sedan had decided the war in Prussia's favour. One French army was now immobilised and besieged in the city of Metz, and no other forces stood on French ground to prevent a German invasion. Nevertheless, the war would continue.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On which date did the battle begin with the Army of Chalons attacking various Prussian divisions?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1 September 1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who commanded the French V Corps in reserve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General De Wimpffen</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As the French were hard-hit by the Prussian artillery, what continued to show up to the battlefield?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more Prussian troops</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which commander of the French calvary led three desperate attacks on Floing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Marguerite</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many casualties did the French suffer?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">over 17,000 men</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A pre-war plan laid out by the late Marshal Niel called for a strong French offensive from Thionville towards Trier and into the Prussian Rhineland.

Despite access to the armaments factories of Lille, the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties, which depressed morale. In January 1871, Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle. The army was severely weakened by low morale, supply problems, the terrible winter weather and low troop quality, whilst general Faidherbe was unable to command due to his poor health, the result of decades of campaigning in West Africa. At the Battle of St. Quentin, the Army of the North suffered a crushing defeat and was scattered, releasing thousands of Prussian soldiers to be relocated to the East.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What army's defeats turned Gambetta to the Army of the North?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Army of the Loire's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Army of the North?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">General Faidherbe</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Several smaller victories were acheived by the protection of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">belt of fortresses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The belt of fortresses were in what area of France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">northern France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">This position in the north allowed whose men to launch fast attacks against Prussian units?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Faidherbe's</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Despite odds of four to one, the III Corps launched a risky attack.

At 20:00, the arrival of the Prussian 4th Infantry Division of the II Corps and with the Prussian right flank on Mance Ravine, the line stabilised. By then, the Prussians of the 1st Guards Infantry Division and the XII and II Corps captured St. Privat forcing the decimated French forces to withdraw. With the Prussians exhausted from the fighting, the French were now able to mount a counter-attack. General Bourbaki, however, refused to commit the reserves of the French Old Guard to the battle because, by that time, he considered the overall situation a 'defeat'.

For most of the war, the three largest German ironclads were out of service with engine troubles; only the turret ship SMS Arminius was available to conduct operations. By the time engine repairs had been completed, the French fleet had already departed. The blockade proved only partially successful due to crucial oversights by the planners in Paris. Reservists that were supposed to be at the ready in case of war, were working in the Newfoundland fisheries or in Scotland. Only part of the 470-ship French Navy put to sea on 24 July. Before long, the French navy ran short of coal, needing 200 short tons (180 t) per day and having a bunker capacity in the fleet of only 250 short tons (230 t). A blockade of Wilhelmshaven failed and conflicting orders about operations in the Baltic Sea or a return to France, made the French naval efforts futile. Spotting a blockade-runner became unwelcome because of the question du charbon; pursuit of Prussian ships quickly depleted the coal reserves of the French ships.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A blockade of what coastline was ordered by the French government at the start of the war?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North German coasts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The small North German navy had how many ironclads at their disposal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">only five</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the only turret ship that was able to conduct operations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">SMS Arminius</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many ships was the French navy able to dispatch to sea?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">470</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In pursuing Prussian ships, what resource was quickly depleted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">coal reserves</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Battle of Spicheren, on 5 August, was the second of three critical French defeats.

The Government of National Defence had no electoral mandate, the Emperor was a captive and the Empress in exile but there had been no abdication de jure and the army was still bound by an oath of allegiance to the defunct imperial régime.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose surrender hit Paris as big news?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Napoleon III</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which empire was overthrown by a popular uprising in Paris?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Second Empire</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The uprising forced a proclamation of what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Provisional Government and a Third Republic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the new government refer to itself?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Government of National Defence</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Bismarck desired an early piece but lacked what in the negotiation process?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a legitimate French authority</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A series of swift Prussian and German victories in eastern France, culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan, saw the army of the Second Empire decisively defeated (Napoleon III had been captured at Sedan on 2 September).

They also argue that he wanted a war to resolve growing domestic political problems. Other historians, notably French historian Pierre Milza, dispute this. On 8 May 1870, shortly before the war, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869.

It was discovered that Prussia had recently built defences around the big North German ports, including coastal artillery batteries with Krupp heavy artillery, which with a range of 4,000 yards (3,700 m), had double the range of French naval guns.

The Prussian batteries could thus destroy French artillery with impunity, before being moved forward to directly support infantry attacks.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of artillery were the French equipped with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bronze, rifled muzzle-loading</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What newer artillery were Prussians using?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">steel breech-loading guns</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the French believe was overly wasted in artillery with a higher rate of fire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ammunition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The Prussian artillery batteries had what percentage more of guns than the French?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30% more</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the typical range that Prussian guns could fire?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2–3 kilometres</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 28 January 1871 the Government of National Defence based in Paris negotiated an armistice with the Prussians. With Paris starving, and Gambetta's provincial armies reeling from one disaster after another, French foreign minister Favre went to Versailles on 24 January to discuss peace terms with Bismarck. Bismarck agreed to end the siege and allow food convoys to immediately enter Paris (including trains carrying millions of German army rations), on condition that the Government of National Defence surrender several key fortresses outside Paris to the Prussians. Without the forts, the French Army would no longer be able to defend Paris.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date did the Government of National Defence negotiate an armistice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">28 January 1871</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With whom did the French government negotiate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Prussians</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What consequence of war were Parisians suffering?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">starving</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which French minister traveled to Versailles to discuss peace?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Favre</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date on which jFarve and Bismarck met?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">24 January</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During the fighting, the Communards killed c. 500 people, including the Archbishop of Paris, and burned down many government buildings, including the Tuileries Palace and the Hotel de Ville. Communards captured with weapons were routinely shot by the army and Government troops killed from 7,000–30,000 Communards in the fighting and in massacres of men, women, and children during and after the Commune. More recent histories, based on studies of the number buried in Paris cemeteries and in mass graves after the fall of the Commune, put the number killed at between 6,000 and 10,000. Twenty-six courts were established to try more than 40,000 people who had been arrested, which took until 1875 and imposed 95 death sentences, of which 23 were inflicted. Forced labour for life was imposed on 251 people, 1,160 people were transported to &quot;a fortified place&quot; and 3,417 people were transported. About 20,000 Communards were held in prison hulks until released in 1872 and a great many Communards fled abroad to England, Switzerland, Belgium or the United States. The survivors were amnestied by a bill introduced by Gambetta in 1880 and allowed to return.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many were killed by the Communards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">500 people</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which religious official was also killed during the fighting?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Archbishop of Paris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of buildings were especially targeted to be burned down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">government buildings</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What famous palace was also burned down?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tuileries Palace</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the rough estimate of the number of people killed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">between 6,000 and 10,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the outset of the Franco-Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired through poor planning and administration. This was partly due to the peacetime organisations of the armies. Each Prussian Corps was based within a Kreis (literally &quot;circle&quot;) around the chief city in an area. Reservists rarely lived more than a day's travel from their regiment's depot. By contrast, French regiments generally served far from their depots, which in turn were not in the areas of France from which their soldiers were drawn. Reservists often faced several days' journey to report to their depots, and then another long journey to join their regiments. Large numbers of reservists choked railway stations, vainly seeking rations and orders.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">At the start of the war, how many German troops were focused on the French frontier?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">462,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many French troops were available to stand again the Germans?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">270,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the literal meaning of the Prussian word &quot;Kreis?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">literally &quot;circle&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the French military numbers suffer from the most?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">having lost 100,000 stragglers</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years. Lessons drawn from the war included the need for a general staff system, the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry. The bold use of artillery by the Prussians, to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range, proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners. The Prussian tactics were adopted by European armies by 1914, exemplified in the French 75, an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry. Most European armies ignored the evidence of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively. This forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire, usually from a position of cover.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military thinking</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Lessons garnered from the war included recognizing the need for what kind of system?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">general staff system</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who adopted the Prussian artillery tactics in 1914?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">European armies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the French 75 optimised to directly support?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">advancing infantry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Evidence from what war suggested the increased benefits of smokeless poweder rifles?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Russo-Japanese War</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The creation of a unified German Empire ended the balance of power that had been created with the Congress of Vienna after the end of the Napoleonic Wars.
