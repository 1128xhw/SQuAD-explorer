However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light. Sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow in intense sources, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination).

Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400 cm−1, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200 cm−1).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the technique that analyzes the constituent bonds of molecules to identify them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Infrared vibrational spectroscopy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happens to a molecule if an oscillation results in a dipole being changed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do the vibrational frequencies of molecules usually correspond to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the frequencies of infrared light</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the term for light radiation in the 4000–400 cm−1 spectrum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the mid-infrared</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In infrared photography, infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. Digital cameras often use infrared blockers. Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can &quot;see&quot; intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called 'T-ray' imaging, which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is used in infrared photography to capture the near-infrared spectrum?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">infrared filters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What devices are often equipped with infrared blockers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Digital cameras</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the technique that involves imaging with terahertz radiation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">'T-ray' imaging</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for terahertz radiation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">far-infrared</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a notable recent development in T-ray imaging?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">terahertz time-domain spectroscopy</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Infrared reflectography (fr; it; es), as called by art conservators, can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner, in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a guide. This often reveals the artist's use of carbon black, which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between – such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version.

These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam. The beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to encode the data. The receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances. Infrared remote control protocols like RC-5, SIRC, are used to communicate with infrared.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the IrDA?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Infrared Data Association</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the acronym LEDs stand for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">light-emitting diodes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is a term for when something is switched on and off?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modulated</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What device is used to transform infrared radiation into an electric current?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">silicon photodiode</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why does infrared not cause trouble for devices in adjacent rooms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">IR does not penetrate walls</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures.
