It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sanskrit is the primary sacred language of which religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hinduism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many scheduled languages are there in present-day India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">22</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Indian state has Sanskrit as its official language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Uttarakhand</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sanskrit is used as a pkilsosophical language in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and which other religion?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sikhism</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Sanskrit is a standardized dialect of which language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old Indo-Aryan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language is the sacred language of Hinduism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Sanskrit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides its uses as language of religions, for what other application can Sanskrit be used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lingua franca</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Sanskrit usually found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what is Sanskrit an adaption?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Old Indo-Aryan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what language did Sanskrit originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Vedic Sanskrit</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Over 90 weeklies, fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit.

Knowledge of Sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient India, and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of Vyākaraṇins such as Pāṇini and Patanjali, who exhorted proper Sanskrit at all times, especially during ritual. Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits, which were Middle Indo-Aryan languages. However, linguistic change led to an eventual loss of mutual intelligibility.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Ancient India, which vernacular languages existed alongside Sanskrit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prakrits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The works of which two scholars were used to teach Sanskrit to the higher castes of India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pāṇini and Patanjali</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The use of Sanskrit was considered to be a marker of what in Ancient India?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social class and educational attainment</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of language were Prakrits?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle Indo-Aryan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Sanskrit linguist describes Sanskrit as a &quot;particularly refined or perfected manner of speaking?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Madhav Deshpande</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What style of speech did linguist Madhav Deshpande say Sanskrit started out as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">perfected manner</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what was Sanskrit once thought to be a divider?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">social class</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How was Sanskrit originally used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ritual</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Sanskrit a learned language of the high classes?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ancient India</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what did Sanskrit exist beside?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">vernacular Prakrits</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Brahmi evolved into a multiplicity of Brahmic scripts, many of which were used to write Sanskrit.

A significant form of post-Vedic Sanskrit is found in the Sanskrit of Indian epic poetry—the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The deviations from Pāṇini in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from Prakrits, or innovations, and not because they are pre-Paninian. Traditional Sanskrit scholars call such deviations ārṣa (आर्ष), meaning 'of the ṛṣis', the traditional title for the ancient authors. In some contexts, there are also more &quot;prakritisms&quot; (borrowings from common speech) than in Classical Sanskrit proper. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit is a literary language heavily influenced by the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, based on early Buddhist Prakrit texts which subsequently assimilated to the Classical Sanskrit standard in varying degrees.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are two examples of epic poetry written in Sanskrit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Ramayana and Mahabharata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are prakritisms?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">borrowings from common speech</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which Sanskrit literary language has been influenced by the Middle Indo-Aryan languages?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was Sanskrit a language of culture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2000 years</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What epic poems are written in post-Vedic Sanskrit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ramayana and Mahabharata</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is a post-Vedic form of Sanskrit found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indian epic poetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of what are deviations in the epics thought to be the influence?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prakrits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is found to a lesser extent in Classical Sanskrit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">prakritisms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From the Rigveda until the time of Pāṇini (fourth century BCE) the development of the early Vedic language can be observed in other Vedic texts: the Samaveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, Brahmanas, and Upanishads.

As such, virtually all the major writing systems of South Asia have been used for the production of Sanskrit manuscripts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Under what type of tradition did Sanskrit begin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oral tradition</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After what language evolved was writing introduced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Prakrits</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does Sanskrit not have of its own?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">native script</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What feature of written text influenced the use of scripts?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">regional scripts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which writing systems have been used to write Sanskrit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">all</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the late 18th century, Sanskrit has been transliterated using the Latin alphabet. The system most commonly used today is the IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration), which has been the academic standard since 1888. ASCII-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include Harvard-Kyoto and ITRANS, a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of Unicode-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online.

The earliest South Indian inscriptions in Tamil Brahmi, written in early Tamil, belong to the same period.

About a century after Pāṇini (around 400 BCE), Kātyāyana composed Vārtikas on the Pāṇini sũtras. Patanjali, who lived three centuries after Pāṇini, wrote the Mahābhāṣya, the &quot;Great Commentary&quot; on the Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vārtikas. Because of these three ancient Vyākaraṇins (grammarians), this grammar is called Trimuni Vyākarana. To understand the meaning of the sutras, Jayaditya and Vāmana wrote a commentary, the Kāsikā, in 600 CE. Pāṇinian grammar is based on 14 Shiva sutras (aphorisms), where the whole mātrika (alphabet) is abbreviated.

The present form of Vedic Sanskrit can be traced back to as early as the second millennium BCE (for Rig-vedic). Scholars often distinguish Vedic Sanskrit and Classical or &quot;Pāṇinian&quot; Sanskrit as separate dialects. Though they are quite similar, they differ in a number of essential points of phonology, vocabulary, grammar and syntax. Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, a large collection of hymns, incantations (Samhitas) and theological and religio-philosophical discussions in the Brahmanas and Upanishads. Modern linguists consider the metrical hymns of the Rigveda Samhita to be the earliest, composed by many authors over several centuries of oral tradition. The end of the Vedic period is marked by the composition of the Upanishads, which form the concluding part of the traditional Vedic corpus; however, the early Sutras are Vedic, too, both in language and content.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">According to Panini, from where did Sanskrit evolve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">earlier Vedic</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">To what time can the present form of Sanskrit be traced?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">second millennium BCE</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As what are Classical and Vedic Sanskrit often viewed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">separate dialects</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Vedic Sanskrit meant to be used as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Vedas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What hymns are thought to be the earliest?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rigveda Samhita</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, many scholars have proposed the Indo-Aryan migration theory, asserting that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in what is now India and Pakistan from the north-west some time during the early second millennium BCE.

This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was &quot;British Indophobia&quot;, which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English &quot;common-sense view&quot; that Indians constituted a &quot;separate, inferior and unimprovable race&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Sanskrit and Indian culture popular?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">18th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what century was Indian culture accorded a more hostile reception?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">early 19th century</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did the British academics show their feelings about Sanskrit?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">neglect</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did British of the 19th century want India to be as soon as possible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">assimilated to Britain</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Besides assimilation of British culture, what else did the British consider Indians to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">inferior</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Satyagraha, an opera by Philip Glass, uses texts from the Bhagavad Gita, sung in Sanskrit.
