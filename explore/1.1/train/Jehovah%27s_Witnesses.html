The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism, convention attendance figures of more than 15 million, and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million. Jehovah's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, a group of elders in Brooklyn, New York, which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible. They prefer to use their own translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations. They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Jehovah Witnesses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">millenarian restorationist Christian denomination</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the beliefs of Jehovah Witnesses distinct from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mainstream Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many adherents worldwide does the group claim?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than 8.2 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is in charges of directing the Jehovah Witnesses?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are the group elders located?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Brooklyn, New York</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching, distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake!, and refusing military service and blood transfusions. They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship. They reject Trinitarianism, inherent immortality of the soul, and hellfire, which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines. They do not observe Christmas, Easter, birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity. Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as &quot;the truth&quot; and consider themselves to be &quot;in the truth&quot;. They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan, and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses. Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping, their term for formal expulsion and shunning. Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned. Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Jehovah witnesses best known for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their door-to-door preaching</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Jehovah Witnesses refuse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">military service and blood transfusions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Jehovah Witnesses consider the name Jehovah vital for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">proper worship</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why do Jehovah Witnesses reject inherent immortality of the soul, hellfire and Trinitarianism?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they consider to be unscriptural doctrines</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why don't Jehovah Witnesses celebrate the usual holidays and customs?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they consider to have pagan origins</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1870, Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to study the Bible. During the course of his ministry, Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul, hellfire, predestination, the fleshly return of Jesus Christ, the Trinity, and the burning up of the world. In 1876, Russell met Nelson H. Barbour; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds, which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy. The book taught that God's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally, each ending with a &quot;harvest,&quot; that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the &quot;harvest of the Gospel age,&quot; and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called &quot;the Gentile Times,&quot; at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God's kingdom on earth. Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal, Herald of the Morning. In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences, and in July, Russell began publishing the magazine Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence, stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in &quot;the last days,&quot; and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Charles Taze Russell form a group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1870</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Russell and others form their group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the purpose of Russell's group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to study the Bible</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">1914 would mark the end of a 2520 year period known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Gentile Times</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When Russell met Nelson H.

Thirty congregations were founded, and during 1879 and 1880, Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings. As congregations continued to form during Russell's ministry, they each remained self-administrative, functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance. In 1881, Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley, and in 1884, Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles. By about 1900, Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs, and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices. By the 1910s, Russell's organization maintained nearly a hundred &quot;pilgrims,&quot; or traveling preachers. Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry, and by 1912, he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Watch Tower supporters gather as autonomous congregations to study the Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">From 1879</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many congregations were founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Thirty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the congregations which continued to form during Russell's ministry remain?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">self-administrative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Russell visit each of the congregations to provide the format he recommended to conduct their meetings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">during 1879 and 1880</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who presided over Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">William Henry Conley</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Russell moved the Watch Tower Society's headquarters to Brooklyn, New York, in 1909, combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named Bethel.

His election was disputed, and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner. The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade. In June 1917, he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures series. The book, published as the posthumous work of Russell, was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation, plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher. It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War. As a result, Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was elected as the Watch Tower Society's president in January of 1917?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Joseph Franklin Rutherford</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Rutherford release The Finished Mystery?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 1917,</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What had Rutherford been before being elected the group's president?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">legal representative</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the Finished Mystery strongly criticize? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic and Protestant clergy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Watch Tower Society directors jailed for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sedition</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society. In 1919, he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation, and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters. At an international convention held at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922, a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching. Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford's twenty-five years as president, including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs (such as Abraham and Isaac) would be resurrected in 1925, marking the beginning of Christ's thousand-year Kingdom. Disappointed by the changes, tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford's tenure, leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, most of which still exist. By mid-1919, as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society, and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where as an international convention held in September of 1922?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Cedar Point, Ohio</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Rutherford institute the appointment of in each congregation in 1919?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a director</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was a new emphasis made on at the international convention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">house-to-house preaching</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were all members instructed to report weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">preaching activity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long was Rutherford's tenure as president of the Society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twenty-five years</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On July 26, 1931, at a convention in Columbus, Ohio, Rutherford introduced the new name—Jehovah's witnesses—based on Isaiah 43:10: &quot;Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen&quot;—which was adopted by resolution. The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society, as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods. In 1932, Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938, introduced what he called a &quot;theocratic&quot; (literally, God-ruled) organizational system, under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Rutherford introduce the new name for the Society?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">July 26, 1931</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What biblical passage was the name Jehovah's witnesses based on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Isaiah 43:10</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What system did Rutherford eliminate in 1932?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">locally elected elders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where were appointments in congregations worldwide made from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Brooklyn headquarters</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From 1932, it was taught that the &quot;little flock&quot; of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon.

It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers, after they have been recommended by local branches, with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions. Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants, and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How are Jehovah Witnesses organized?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">hierarchically</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the theocratic organization of Jehovah Witnesses reflect on Earth?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">God's &quot;visible organization&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What gender are all the members of the Governing Body?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">male</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many members does the Governing Body consist of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">seven</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does the Governing Body direct?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">several committees</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants.

Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body, which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture. The Governing Body does not issue any single, comprehensive &quot;statement of faith&quot;, but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society. Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation, in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose, and that such enlightenment or &quot;new light&quot; results from the application of reason and study, the guidance of the holy spirit, and direction from Jesus Christ and angels. The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to discern &quot;deep truths&quot;, which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions. The religion's leadership, while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility, is said to provide &quot;divine guidance&quot; through its teachings described as &quot;based on God's Word thus ... not from men, but from Jehovah.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Jehovah Witnesses believe their religion is a restoration of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">first-century Christianity</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who establishes the doctrines of the Jehovah Witnesses? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Governing Body</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where does the Governing Body express its doctrinal position?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through publications published by the Watch Tower Society</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How does God reveal his will and purpose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gradually</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Jehovah Witnesses' leadership said to provide?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">divine guidance</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired, inerrant word of God.

Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended; Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and &quot;private ideas&quot; reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications, and are cautioned against reading other religious literature. Adherents are told to have &quot;complete confidence&quot; in the leadership, avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society's literature, and &quot;not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding.&quot; The religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is considered the inspired, inerrant word of God?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The entire Protestant canon</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Jehovah Witnesses consider the science and history within the Bible to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">accurate</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose pronouncements within Jehovah Witnesses group are considered to carry almost as much weight as the Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the Governing Body</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are members of Jehovah Witnesses cautioned against reading?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">other religious literature</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is there no provision for members of the Jehovah Witnesses to do in relation to the official teachings?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">criticize or contribute</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God's only direct creation, that everything else was created by means of Christ, and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God's &quot;only-begotten Son&quot;.

They consider all other present-day religions to be false, identifying them with &quot;Babylon the Great&quot;, or the &quot;harlot&quot;, of Revelation 17, and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations, which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17. This development will mark the beginning of the &quot;great tribulation&quot;. Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah's Witnesses, an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon, during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ's &quot;sheep&quot;, or true followers, will be destroyed. After Armageddon, God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth, which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden. After Armageddon, most of those who had died before God's intervention will gradually be resurrected during &quot;judgment day&quot; lasting for one thousand years. This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds. At the end of the thousand years, Christ will hand all authority back to God. Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind. Those who fail will be destroyed, along with Satan and his demons. The end result will be a fully tested, glorified human race.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">One of Jehovah Witnesses' central teachings is that the world entered into its last days at what year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1914</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Jehovah Witnesses consider all other present day religions to be?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">false</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who do Jehovah Witnesses think is out to destroy them?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the United Nations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who needs to attack Jehovah Witnesses for God to begin the war of Armageddon?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Satan</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What will be the end result of God's kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a fully tested, glorified human race</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God's kingdom in October 1914, and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth, resulting in &quot;woe&quot; to humanity.

They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia—usually translated as &quot;coming&quot; when referring to Christ—as &quot;presence&quot;. They believe Jesus' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914, and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth.

Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose &quot;territory&quot; they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as &quot;meetings&quot; as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for &quot;family worship&quot;. Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a &quot;circuit&quot; gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day &quot;regional convention&quot;, usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that &quot;losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.&quot; The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who administers formal discipline?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">congregation elders</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is formed when a baptized member is accused of doing something serious enough for Jehovah Witnesses to take notice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a judicial committee</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the strongest form of discipline the Jehovah Witnesses' judicial committee can render?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Disfellowshipping</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Jehovah Witnesses describe anyone who formally resign from the church as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">wicked</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Jehovah Witnesses taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals does?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">keeps the congregation free from immoral influence</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions, on the basis that there can only be one truth from God, and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements.

The religion has been criticized for its &quot;two witness rule&quot; for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that &quot;the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands&quot;. A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, &quot;which is an impossibility&quot;. Anderson says the policies &quot;protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.&quot; Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are Jehovah's Witnesses accused of concealing within their organization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">sexual abuse</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose hands should elders leave allegations of sexual abuse in when the accused person denies wrongdoing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jehovah's</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who does Barbara Anderson feel the church's policy regarding sexual abuse protects?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">pedophiles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What do Jehovah's Witnesses maintain they want to protect?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">children</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jehovah's Witnesses do not sponsor activities when the result is the separation of whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">children from parents</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The religion's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized.

In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court, reportedly paying as much as $780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has the Jehovah's Witnesses failure to report to authorities been criticized? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">abuse allegations</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Of the 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by Jehovah's Witnesses within their organization since 1950, how many were reported to secular authorities?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">not one</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why are the Jehovah's Witnesses reluctant to alert authorities to abuse?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">to protect its &quot;crime-free&quot; reputation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What have courts in both the UK and the US found the Watch Tower Society to have been for failing to protect children from sexual predators within the congregation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">negligent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much has the Society reportedly paid to settle lawsuits without admitting any wrongdoing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as much as $780,000 to one plaintiff</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD 2016</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
