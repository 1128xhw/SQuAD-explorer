In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the Palace of Westminster. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament of his or her agreement to the bill.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When royal assent takes place in the UK, where does the sovereign make an appearance?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Lords</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Alternatively, when UK Lord Commissioners take the sovereign's place in the ceremony, where does the ceremony take place?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palace of Westminster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Canadian governor generals can give their assent in person or by which other method?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">written declaration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what is royal assent sometimes associated with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">elaborate ceremonies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where is a royal assent ceremony held within the United Kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Palace of Westminster</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what method is royal assent generally granted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">letters patent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How is royal assent granted within Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the governor-general merely signs the bill</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Royal assent is the method by which a country's constitutional monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament, thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law. In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government.

Since these ministers most often maintain the support of parliament and are the ones who obtain the passage of bills, it is highly improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. An exception is sometimes stated to be if bills are not passed in good faith, though it is difficult to make an interpretation on what this circumstance might constitute. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Modern-day sovereigns often acts on the advice of whom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ministers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In the event that the monarch refuses to give royal assent, what can the monarch make use of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">reserve powers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Whose advice does a sovereign follow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">his or her ministers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who often maintains parliamentary support and obtains the passage of bills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ministers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Is it probable, improbable, or impossible that a sovereign would withhold assent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">improbable</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Originally, legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia Regis, or Royal Council, in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament. The so-called Model Parliament included bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members. In 1265, the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation. The body eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the House of Lords, while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons. The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law. During Henry VI's reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the sovereign's assent was obtained, as the sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Hence, all acts include the clause &quot;Be it enacted by the Queen's (King's) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...&quot;. The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is another name for &quot;Curia Regis&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Royal Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was it that peculiarly called a full parliament without royal authorization in 1265?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Earl of Leicester</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">As a result, the bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed which body of parliament?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Lords</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which body did the shire and borough representatives form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Commons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From what did parliament evolve?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Curia Regis, or Royal Council</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What positions were contained within the House of Lords?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">bishops, abbots, earls, and barons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which branch of parliament contains shire and borough representatives?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">House of Commons</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">A bill could not become a law without whose assent?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the sovereign</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who is considered the enactor of laws?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the sovereign</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs. Charles I dissolved parliament in 1629, after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power. During the eleven years of personal rule that followed, Charles performed legally dubious actions, such as raising taxes without parliament's approval. After the English Civil War, it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly, but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills. In 1678, Charles II withheld his assent from a bill &quot;for preserving the Peace of the Kingdom by raising the Militia, and continuing them in Duty for Two and Forty Days,&quot; suggesting that he, not parliament, should control the militia. The last Stuart monarch, Anne, similarly withheld on 11 March 1708, on the advice of her ministers, her assent from a bill for the settling of Militia in Scotland. No monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the British parliament.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which monarch was responsible for dissolving parliament in 1629?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Charles I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one action this monarch took that is typically left to the discretion of parliament?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">raising taxes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">After which event was it decided that parliament should meet on a regular basis?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English Civil War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Like Charles II had previously done, the last Stuart monarch withheld assent.

The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers to a greater extent than did previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">During whose rule was power transferred more to parliament?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hanoverian dynasty</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first ruler during this dynasty?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In attempting to take back control, George III and George IV opposed which church movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic Emancipation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which monarch relied on his ministers more than any of his predecessors?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George I</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did George III and George IV both oppose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Catholic Emancipation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What rule did George III and George IV believe a Catholic emancipation bill would violate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Coronation Oath</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which monarch granted assent reluctantly under the advise of his ministers?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">George IV</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Royal assent is the final stage in the legislative process for acts of the Scottish parliament.

In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house.

They, therefore, are unlikely to advise the sovereign or his or her representative to withhold assent. The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta's lieutenant governor, John C. Bowen, in 1937, in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart's Social Credit party. Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province, thereby interfering with the federal government's powers.

When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When assent is granted in person, when is it formally considered final?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">An assent is considered granted when applying the Royal Assent Act 1967 when both presiding officers have done what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When is assent effective if the presiding officers inform their houses at different times?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">when the second announcement is made</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Independently of the method used to signify royal assent, it is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Parliaments, once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted.

One result, conceived as part of a string of royal duties intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent kingdom, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during the 1939 royal tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately ( the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of Royal Assent), was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed.

On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: &quot;in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.&quot; If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites &quot;in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills.

In 1990, when King Baudouin advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalising abortion (a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister), the Council of Ministers, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers &quot;on behalf of the Belgian People&quot;.
