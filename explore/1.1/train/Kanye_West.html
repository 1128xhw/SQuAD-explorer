Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread commercial and critical success, and founded record label GOOD Music. He went on to explore a variety of different musical styles on subsequent albums that included the baroque-inflected Late Registration (2005), the arena-inspired Graduation (2007), and the starkly polarizing 808s &amp; Heartbreak (2008). In 2010, he released his critically acclaimed fifth album, the maximalist My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and the following year he collaborated with Jay-Z on the joint LP Watch the Throne (2011). West released his abrasive sixth album, Yeezus, to further critical praise in 2013. Following a series of recording delays and work on non-musical projects, West's seventh album, The Life of Pablo, was released in 2016.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first label that Kanye produced for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roc-A-Fella Records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are some well known artists that Kanye produced for early in his career?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay-Z and Alicia Keys</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many albums has Kanye released since starting his solo career in 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With which artists that Kanye formerly produced for did he go on to collaborate with?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay-Z</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Kanye West live as a child?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Chicago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Kanye West's first job title after art school?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">producer</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Kanye West release his first rap CD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many total CDs has Kanye West released in his career so far?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">7</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 32 million albums and 100 million digital downloads worldwide.

Growing up in the city,[which?] West became deeply involved in its hip hop scene. He started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists. At age thirteen, West wrote a rap song called &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; and began to persuade his mother to pay $25 an hour for time in a recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio where a microphone hung from the ceiling by a wire clothes hanger. Although this wasn't what West's mother wanted, she nonetheless supported him. West crossed paths with producer/DJ No I.D., with whom he quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor, and it was from him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received his first sampler at age 15.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Kanye creating when he was five?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">poetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was one of the first tracks written by Kanye when he was 13?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Kanye meet early in his career who later mentored him?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">DJ No I.D.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What activity did Kanye West start doing when he was five?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">writing poetry</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the song he wrote at age thirteen?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Green Eggs and Ham</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the producer that helped Kanye West?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">No I.D.</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to Chicago State University to study English.

This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, &quot;It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college.

His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on Down to Earth, the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav. For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie. Because of his association with D-Dot, West wasn't able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar. His group was managed by John &quot;Monopoly&quot; Johnson, Don Crowley, and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle Period. After attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances, The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album World Record Holders in 1999. The album featured other Chicago-based rappers such as Rhymefest, Mikkey Halsted, Miss Criss, and Shayla G. Meanwhile, the production was handled by West, Arrowstar, Boogz, and Brian &quot;All Day&quot; Miller.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the beats Kanye made in the 90's originally intended for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">local artists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of records did Kanye sample in his early career.</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">classic soul records</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What music group did Kanye join when he couldn't release his solo album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Go-Getters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what time period did Kanye begin producing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Kanye West start his production career?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">mid-1990s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">For which artist did Kanye West act as a ghost producer? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What late 1990s Chicago rap group was Kanye West a member of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Go-Getters</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What firm managed Kanye West's rap group? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hustle Period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was the first Go-Getters album released? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1999</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West spent much of the late-1990s producing records for a number of well-known artists and music groups.

The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, &quot;Through The Wire&quot;, expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West &quot;all the better artists have expressed what they were going through&quot;. West added that &quot;the album was my medicine&quot;, as working on the record distracted him from the pain. &quot;Through The Wire&quot; was first available on West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called The College Dropout, whose overall theme was to &quot;make your own decisions.

He recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. Once he had completed the album, it was leaked months before its release date. However, West decided to use the opportunity to review the album, and The College Dropout was significantly remixed, remastered, and revised before being released. As a result, certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted, among them &quot;Keep the Receipt&quot; with Ol' Dirty Bastard and &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; with Consequence. West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, improved drum programming and new verses. West's perfectionism led The College Dropout to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Kanye's debut album that caused him to remaster most of it?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">it was leaked</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was the release date for Kanye's first album pushed back?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what city did West finish recording his first album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Los Angeles</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times was The College Dropout's release put off?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">3</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was supposed to be the original release date for The College Dropout?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">August 2003</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, &quot;Through the Wire&quot; peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What place on the Billboard chart did Kanye's album debut at?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many publications voted The College Dropout for album of the year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the single off the debut album that gave Kanye mainstream attention?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jesus Walks</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What label did Kanye create following the success of his first album's release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GOOD Music</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was The College Dropout finally released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 2004</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song was the second released off of Kanye's The College Dropout album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Slow Jamz&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Grammy nominations did The College Dropout receive?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">10</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the record label that West founded?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GOOD Music</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Beginning his second effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album. West was significantly inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. Late Registration sold over 2.3 million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of ensemble did Kanye hire to work on his second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">string orchestra</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What composer worked alongside Kanye on the album's production?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jon Brion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Kanye's second studio album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Late Registration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many copies of Late Registration sold in its first year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2.3 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What English music group was an inspiration for Kanye West on his second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portishead</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of West's second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Late Registration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many copies of Late Registration were sold in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2.3 million</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While West had encountered controversy a year prior when he stormed out of the American Music Awards of 2004 after losing Best New Artist, the rapper's first large-scale controversy came just days following Late Registration's release, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina victims. In September 2005, NBC broadcast A Concert for Hurricane Relief, and West was a featured speaker. When West was presenting alongside actor Mike Myers, he deviated from the prepared script. Myers spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he said, &quot;George Bush doesn't care about black people.&quot; West's comment reached much of the United States, leading to mixed reactions; President Bush would later call it one of the most &quot;disgusting moments&quot; of his presidency. West raised further controversy in January 2006 when he posed on the cover of Rolling Stone wearing a crown of thorns.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The loss of which award caused Kanye to leave the American Music Awards?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Best New Artist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Kanye participated alongside Mike Meyers in a relief benefit show for what natural disaster?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hurricane Katrina</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What magazine did Kanye don a thorn crown for the cover of in 2006?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rolling Stone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In which AMA category did Kanye lose in 2004?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Best New Artist</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which actor was alongside Kanye West when he insulted President Bush?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Mike Myers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What magazine did Kanye West pose for in 2006 that caused another controversy?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rolling Stone</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What broadcast for NBC was Kanye presenting for when he spoke negatively about President Bush?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">A Concert for Hurricane Relief</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Fresh off spending the previous year touring the world with U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas. To this end, West incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production, utilized slower tempos, and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980s. In addition to U2, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression. To make his next effort, the third in a planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums, more introspective and personal in lyricism, West listened to folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his wordplay and storytelling ability.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What band did Kanye tour with for a year?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What setting did Kanye want his next tracks to perform well in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large arenas</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Kanye study in order to develop his lyrical skills?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which band did Kanye West travel with for the Vertigo Tour?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">U2</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What decade of music inspired Kanye West after his tour with U2?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Other than U2 and Led Zeppelin, what other band inspired Kanye West?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Rolling Stones</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other country singer besides Johnny Cash did Kanye listen to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Bob Dylan</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West's third studio album, Graduation, garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent's Curtis. Upon their September 2007 releases, Graduation outsold Curtis by a large margin, debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week. Graduation once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West, and the album's lead single, &quot;Stronger&quot;, garnered the rapper his third number-one hit. &quot;Stronger&quot;, which samples French house duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s. Ben Detrick of XXL cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who didn't follow the hardcore-gangster mold, writing, &quot;If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop's changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Kanye's third album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Graduation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Kanye released Graduation at the same time of what other famous rapper, thus drawing media comparison?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50 Cent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many copies did Graduation sell in its first week of release? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">957,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What famous electronic duo did Kanye sample on his third album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daft Punk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Kanye West's third CD?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Graduation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artist was Kanye's third album release competing against?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50 Cent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What music group was in Kanye's first release off of Graduation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Daft Punk</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West's life took a different direction when his mother, Donda West, died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in November 2007.

The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter. Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor Auto-Tune, which would become a central part of his next effort.

While it was criticized prior to release, 808s &amp; Heartbreak had a significant effect on hip-hop music, encouraging other rappers to take more creative risks with their productions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What label pushed out Kanye's fourth studio album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Island Def Jam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which album by Kanye West featured the song &quot;Love Lockdown&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">808s &amp; Heartbreak</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">808s &amp; Heartbreak was released by what company? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Island Def Jam</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was 808s &amp; Heartbreaks released? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 2008</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the second song released off of 808s? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Heartless</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The major usage of musical machine on 808s was described as eponymous?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roland TR-808 drum machine</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 2012, Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote, &quot;Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, 808s &amp; Heartbreak has revealed itself to be Kanye’s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What journalist gave &quot;808s and Hearbreak&quot; critical acclimation 4 years after its release?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Matthew Trammell</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the journalist that wrote about Kanye's album in 2012?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Matthew Trammell</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West's controversial incident the following year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was arguably his biggest controversy, and led to widespread outrage throughout the music industry.

He was subsequently withdrawn from the remainder of the show for his actions.

Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the &quot;communal&quot; atmosphere as thus: &quot;With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire.&quot; A variety of artists contributed to the project, including close friends Jay-Z, Kid Cudi and Pusha T, as well as off-the-wall collaborations, such as with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Kanye base himself to create his next album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hawaii</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What industry did Kanye turn to after taking a break from recording music?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">fashion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What state did Kanye West hide in while writing his next album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hawaii</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to rave reviews from critics, many of whom described it as his best work that solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit &quot;All of the Lights&quot;, and Billboard hits &quot;Power&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, and &quot;Runaway&quot;, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name. During this time, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday, a portion of which were included on the album. This promotion ran from August 20 - December 17, 2010. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a &quot;snub&quot; by several media outlets.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of Kanye's album released in 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What award was My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy omitted from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Album of the Year</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Kanye's fifth album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Kanye West's fifth album debuted? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">November 2010</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song off of Kanye's fifth album was a hit internationally?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;All of the Lights&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the free music promotion on Kanye's website in 2010?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">GOOD Fridays</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as &quot;one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time&quot;, West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z.

In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: &quot;Mercy&quot; and &quot;Clique&quot;.

Determined to &quot;undermine the commercial&quot;, he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances. Yeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics. It became the rapper's sixth consecutive number one debut, but also marked his lowest solo opening week sales. Def Jam issued &quot;Black Skinhead&quot; to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar accompanying him along the way.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Kanye begin production on his sixth album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Paris</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What became the name of his sixth studio album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yeezus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Kanye tour alongside of in order to promote the efforts of Yeezus?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kendrick Lamar</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Kanye West begin working on his sixth album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the inspiration behind Kanye West's decision to call Rick Rubin?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">architecture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Kanye's sixth album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yeezus</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On what date was Yeezus released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">June 18, 2013</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artist did Kanye go on tour with while promoting album number six?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Kendrick Lamar</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In June 2013, West and television personality Kim Kardashian announced the birth of their first child, North.

Later that month, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture, officially making him an honorary DFA. The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. At one point, he told the audience: &quot;You are now watching the greatest living rock star on the planet.&quot; Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were sharply divided on his performance. NME stated, &quot;The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs.&quot; The publication added that &quot;he's letting his music speak for and prove itself.&quot; The Guardian said that &quot;his set has a potent ferocity – but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did Kanye change the title of his next planned album from So Help Me God to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">SWISH</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From which institution did Kanye receive an honorary doctorate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Art Institute of Chicago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people signed a petition to keep Kanye from performing at Glastonbury Festival?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">135,000</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original name of Kanye's album &quot;SWISH&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">So Help Me God</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What school awarded Kanye west an honorary doctorate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">School of the Art Institute of Chicago</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many people petitioned his show at the Glastonbury Music Festival in the UK?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">135,000</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In December 2015, West released a song titled &quot;Facts&quot;.

This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track &quot;Waves&quot; at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on 14 February 2016 following a performance on SNL.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the tentative release date announced for Kanye's next studio album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">February 11</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was Kanye's next album renamed again to?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Waves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">With what other rapper did Kanye west have a Twitter feud with in early 2016?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wiz Khalifa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What became the final title of Kanye's next album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Life of Pablo</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What platform was The Life of Pablo officially released on?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tidal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What song  by West was debuted in December 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Facts&quot;</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On January 26, 2016, Kanye told the world he changed the name of his next album from SWISH to what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Waves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What artist did Kanye West have a feud with over Amber Rose?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Wiz Khalifa</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Kanye's clothing line premiered at Madison Square Garden?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yeezy Season 3</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West's musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts, and has seen him develop and explore a variety of different musical approaches and genres throughout his work. When asked about his musical inspirations, he has named A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna as early interests. He has further described musician David Bowie as one of his &quot;most important inspirations,&quot; and named producer Puff Daddy as the &quot;most important cultural figure in my life.&quot; Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed &quot;chipmunk soul&quot; which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&amp;B songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;, a track from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has named Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol' Dirty Bastard as inspirations. RZA spoke positively of the comparisons, stating in an interview for Rolling Stone, &quot;All good.

Blending West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, the album experimentally incorporated a wide array of different genres and prominent orchestral elements, including string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. It also incorporated a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not typical in popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, harpsichord, Chamberlin, CS-80 analog synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba. Rolling Stone described Late Registration as West claiming &quot;the whole world of music as hip-hop turf&quot; chronicling the album as &quot;his mad quest to explode every cliché about hip-hop identity.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;there's never been hip-hop so complex and subtle musically.&quot; For a period of time, Kanye West stood as the sole current pop star to tour with a string section, as audible on his 2006 live album Late Orchestration.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What composer did Kanye collaborate with for his second record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jon Brion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What classical elements did Brion bring to the production of Kanye's album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">orchestral elements, including string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of orchestra did Kanye tour with while promoting his second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a string section</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What composer did Kanye West work with for his second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jon Brion</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What English trip-hop group helped influence Kanye on his second album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Portishead</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With his third album, Graduation (2007), West moved away from the sound of his previous releases and towards a more atmospheric, rock-tinged, electronic-influenced soundscape. The musical evolution arose from him listening to music genres encompassing European Britpop and Euro-disco, American alternative and indie-rock, and his native Chicago house. Towards this end, West retracted much of the live instrumentation that characterized his previous album and replaced it with heavy, gothic synthesizers, distorted synth-chords, rave stabs, house beats, electro-disco rhythms, and a wide array of modulated electronic noises and digital audio-effects. In addition, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones, U2, and Led Zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Kanye's third record?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Graduation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What musical direction did Kanye take with his third album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more atmospheric, rock-tinged, electronic-influenced soundscape</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Kanye drew inspiration from The Rolling Stones, U2, and Led Zeppelin in what ways?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">melody and chord progression</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Kanye West's third album released?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West's fourth studio album, 808s &amp; Heartbreak (2008), marked an even more radical departure from his previous releases, largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of a stark electropop sound composed of virtual synthesis, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Gary Numan, TJ Swan and Boy George, and maintaining a &quot;minimal but functional&quot; approach towards the album's studio production, West explored the electronic feel produced by Auto-Tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808, manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted, electronic sound; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks. The album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synthesizers, and somber piano, and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups, with West himself later confessing an affinity with British post-punk group Joy Division. Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article, &quot;Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, 808s &amp; Heartbreak has revealed itself to be Kanye’s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of sound did Kanye abandon a rap and hiphop one for with his fourth album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">electropop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Kanye become inspired by while creating 808s &amp; Heartbreak?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Gary Numan, TJ Swan and Boy George</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What types of instruments are present on his fourth album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synthesizers, and somber piano</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other artist besides Gary Numan and TJ Swan helped inspire Kanye's fourth album?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Boy George</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What other type of 1980s group was Kanye's fourth album compared to other than new wave?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">post-punk</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The article about Kanye's fourth album written by Matthew Trammell was published in what magazine?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Rolling Stone</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West's fifth album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, has been noted by writers for its maximalist aesthetic and its incorporation of elements from West's previous four albums.

Inspired by the minimalist design of Le Corbusier and primarily electronic in nature, the album features distorted drum machines and &quot;synthesizers that sound like they're malfunctioning, low-resolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura to the most analog sounds.&quot; To this end, the album incorporates glitches reminiscent of CD skips or corrupted MP3's, and Auto-Tuned vocals are modulated to a point in which they are difficult to decipher. It also continues West's practice of eclectic samples: he employs a sample of Nina Simone's &quot;Strange Fruit,&quot; an obscure Hindi sample on &quot;I Am a God&quot;, and a sample of 1970s Hungarian rock group Omega on &quot;New Slaves&quot;. &quot;On Sight&quot; interpolates a melody from &quot;Sermon (He'll Give Us What We Really Need)&quot; by the Holy Name of Mary Choral Family.

The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. &quot;The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value&quot;, stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What platform was Kanye named  a co-owner of in 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tidal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What longtime friend of Kanye acquired Tidal in 2015?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay-Z</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What criticisms of other streaming platforms does Tidal stand to challenge?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">low payout of royalties</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What music streaming service is Kanye West a co-owner of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Tidal</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is Tidal's specialization?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">lossless audio and high definition music videos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which famous rapper bought Aspiro?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jay Z</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What music service is a huge competitor for Tidal?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Spotify</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>West, alongside his mother, founded the &quot;Kanye West Foundation&quot; in Chicago in 2003, tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates, while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education.

Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it &quot;highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.&quot; Rolling Stone credited West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, &quot;establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap [...]&quot;, and called him &quot;as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up.&quot; His 2008 album 808s &amp; Heartbreak polarized both listeners and critics upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What overabundance of themes did Kanye criticize early in his career?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">homophobia in hip hop</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The shift away from what genre of rap is Kanye credited for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gangsta rap</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of background did Kanye West grow up in?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">middle-class</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Kanye West have a sales competition with during his album release of Graduation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">50 Cent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who said that Kanye West effectively led a new wave of artists that weren't only interested in rapping about gunplay or drug dealing?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Ben Detrick</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A substantial number of artists and other figures have been influenced by, or complimented, West's work, including hip hop artists RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Chuck D of Public Enemy, and DJ Premier of Gang Starr.
