The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel, associated with the god El, somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE. The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the Kingdom of Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources in the Bible mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian Captivity and Exile, to Babylonian Captivity and Exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation, and the historical relations between Israelites and the homeland, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group originated as a national and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the kingdom of Judah?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Israelites</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were incoming nomadic groups known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hebrews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did Jews originate as a national and religious group in the Middle East?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Merneptah Stele</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to a report published in 2014, about 43% of all Jews reside in Israel (6.1 million), and 40% in the United States (5.7 million), with most of the remainder living in Europe (1.4 million) and Canada (0.4 million).

The growth of Yahweh-centric belief, along with a number of cultic practices, gradually gave rise to a distinct Israelite ethnic group, setting them apart from other Canaanites. The Canaanites themselves are archeologically attested in the Middle Bronze Age, while the Hebrew language is the last extant member of the Canaanite languages.

The term Jew originated from the Roman &quot;Judean&quot; and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from &quot;Israelites&quot; to &quot;Jews&quot; (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many times did Israelites have political independence in ancient history? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">twice</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">From where did the term Jews originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Roman &quot;Judean</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was land divided into Israel and Judah?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">After the fall of the United Monarchy</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Inhabitants of Judah are known as what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jews</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Babylonian exile end?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">539 BCE</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genetic studies on Jews show that most Jews worldwide bear a common genetic heritage which originates in the Middle East, and that they bear their strongest resemblance to the peoples of the Fertile Crescent.

Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a &quot;way of life,&quot; which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism, Jewish culture, and Jewish identity rather difficult. Throughout history, in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world, in Europe before and after The Age of Enlightenment (see Haskalah), in Islamic Spain and Portugal, in North Africa and the Middle East, India, China, or the contemporary United States and Israel, cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious. Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings, others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to from the religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities, each as authentically Jewish as the next.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What book is considered a religious interpretation of the traditions and early national history of the Jews?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Hebrew Bible</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What religions are now practiced by 54% of the world?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Abrahamic religions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Hebrew Bible?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a religious interpretation of the traditions and early national history of the Jews</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Judaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used.

Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because &quot;[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others.&quot; Leviticus 24:10 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is &quot;of the community of Israel.&quot; This is complemented by Ezra 10:2–3, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children.

Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally.

The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 CE, also limited Judaism's appeal. In addition, historians argue the very figure (4 million) that had been guessed to account for the population of Jews in the ancient Roman Empire is an error that has long been disproven and thus the assumption that conversion impacted Jewish population growth in ancient Rome on a large scale is false.

Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic as their mother tongue.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What language is spoken by more Jews in history than any other language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Yiddish</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">North Africans continue to use what language as their mother tongue?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">North Africans</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are the three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hebrew, English, and Russian</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">South African Jews adopted which language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which language has by and far superseded most Jewish vernaculars?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">English</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities &quot;showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.&quot; Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude &quot;Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with what group?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Jewish and Middle Eastern groups</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Jewish traditions place most Jewish paternal origins in which region?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Middle East</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which lineages are generally more heterogeneous?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">maternal lineages</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Studies of autosomal DNA, which look at the entire DNA mixture, have become increasingly important as the technology develops. They show that Jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related groups in independent communities, with most in a community sharing significant ancestry in common. For Jewish populations of the diaspora, the genetic composition of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jewish populations show a predominant amount of shared Middle Eastern ancestry. According to Behar, the most parsimonious explanation for this shared Middle Eastern ancestry is that it is &quot;consistent with the historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelite residents of the Levant&quot; and &quot;the dispersion of the people of ancient Israel throughout the Old World&quot;. North African, Italian and others of Iberian origin show variable frequencies of admixture with non-Jewish historical host populations among the maternal lines. In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews), who are closely related, the source of non-Jewish admixture is mainly southern European, while Mizrahi Jews show evidence of admixture with other Middle Eastern populations and Sub-Saharan Africans.

The result is that most countries in the Diaspora have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the rate of interreligious marriage in the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">just under 50%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the rate of interreligious marriage in the United Kingdom?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">53%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the rate of interreligious marriage in France?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">30%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the rate of interreligious marriage in Mexico?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as low as 10%</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the rate of interreligious marriage in Australia?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">as low as 10%</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the Papal States, which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos.

The &quot;bad&quot; kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian.

Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands, known as dhimmis, were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs, but they were subject to certain conditions. They had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to the Islamic state. Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims. Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by Bernard Lewis as &quot;most degrading&quot; was the requirement of distinctive clothing, not found in the Quran or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad; its enforcement was highly erratic. On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">dhimmis</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">jizya</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the disability described by Bernard Lewis as &quot;most degrading?&quot;</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">requirement of distinctive clothing</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Which group had an inferior status under Islamic rule?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Dhimmis</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Notable exceptions include the massacre of Jews and forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in Al-Andalus in the 12th century, as well as in Islamic Persia, and the forced confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as mellahs beginning from the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century.

The history of antisemitism includes the First Crusade which resulted in the massacre of Jews; the Spanish Inquisition (led by Tomás de Torquemada) and the Portuguese Inquisition, with their persecution and autos-da-fé against the New Christians and Marrano Jews; the Bohdan Chmielnicki Cossack massacres in Ukraine; the Pogroms backed by the Russian Tsars; as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled.

The Holocaust—the state-led systematic persecution and genocide of European Jews (and certain communities of North African Jews in European controlled North Africa) and other minority groups of Europe during World War II by Germany and its collaborators remains the most notable modern-day persecution of Jews. The persecution and genocide were accomplished in stages. Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society was enacted years before the outbreak of World War II. Concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in Eastern Europe, specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings. Jews and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers. Virtually every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the mass murder, turning the country into what one Holocaust scholar has called &quot;a genocidal nation.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How many Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">approximately 6 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Worldwide, how many Jews were there in 1939?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">15 million</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What was the state-led systematic persecution and genocide of European Jews and other minority groups?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The Holocaust</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1939, what fraction of Jews were killed in The Holocaust?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than a third</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There is also a trend of Orthodox movements pursuing secular Jews in order to give them a stronger Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage.
