With a changing society, more citizens have begun to press for acknowledging multiracial ancestry. The Census Bureau changed its data collection by allowing people to self-identify as more than one ethnicity. Some ethnic groups are concerned about the potential political and economic effects, as federal assistance to historically underserved groups has depended on Census data.

In addition, social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to &quot;pass&quot; as white. Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States, such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day). Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial. In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the effect of there no longer being a stigma on interracial marriage?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more people are openly forming interracial unions</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has caused more people of mixed races to the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Diverse immigration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was there a period of formal racial segregation?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was elected and was the first multiracial president of the United States?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Barack Obama</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why were Americans allowed to start checking more than one box to identify their race in the Census in 200?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first multiracial president elected in the US</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the US begin to experience a growing multiracial identity movement?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who are &quot;mestizos&quot;?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the US census start to allow residents to mark more than one ethno-racial identity on the census form?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has brought more mixed race people to the US?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">.

Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves, some by deed and others by will, so that from 1782 to 1810, the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the numbers of free people of color increase dramatically?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">After the American Revolutionary War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How were the laws in New York abolished?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">in programs of gradual emancipation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How long did it take for states like New York to abolish all slave laws?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">more than two decades to be completed</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who in the south were urging their churches to free their slaves in the south?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quaker and Methodist preachers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the last slaves freed in New York state?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When did the number of free people of color begin to increase in the North and South?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">After the American Revolutionary War</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who implored slaveholders to free their slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused many slaveholder to free their slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How much did the percentage of free people in the South change from 1782 to 1810?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South.</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when it takes several years for slaves to be freed in a program?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gradual emancipation</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The last slave in New York was freed when?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1827</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused Quaker and Methodist preachers to want to free slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Second Great Awakening</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In 1810, how many black people were considered free?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">nearly 10 percent</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What caused many men to free slaves from 1782 to 1810?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Revolutionary ideals</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation, in the early 20th century, most southern states created laws based on the one-drop rule, defining as black, persons with any known African ancestry.

There is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number, but people live according to social and cultural identities, not DNA. Historical reasons, including slavery creating a racial caste and the European-American suppression of Native Americans, often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity, generally that of the culture in which they were raised. Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities.

In addition, not all Native Americans have been tested, so scientists do not know for sure that Native Americans have only the genetic markers they have identified.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who says genetic tests can't tell the difference between different Native American nations?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Geneticists</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are geneticists looking for?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the pattern of markers</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is there genetic evidence of?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">three major migrations into North America</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some multiracial individuals feel marginalized by U.S. society.

They had six children of record; four Hemings children survived into adulthood, and he freed them all, among the very few slaves he freed. Two were allowed to &quot;escape&quot; to the North in 1822, and two were granted freedom by his will upon his death in 1826. Seven-eighths white by ancestry, all four of his Hemings children moved to northern states as adults; three of the four entered the white community, and all their descendants identified as white. Of the descendants of Madison Hemings, who continued to identify as black, some in future generations eventually identified as white and &quot;married out&quot;, while others continued to identify as African American. It was socially advantageous for the Hemings children to identify as white, in keeping with their appearance and the majority proportion of their ancestry.

The association of slavery with a &quot;race&quot; led to slavery as a racial caste. But, most families of free people of color formed in Virginia before the American Revolution were the descendants of unions between white women and African men, who frequently worked and lived together in the looser conditions of the early colonial period. While interracial marriage was later prohibited, white men frequently took sexual advantage of slave women, and numerous generations of multiracial children were born. By the late 1800s it had become common among African Americans to use passing to gain educational opportunities as did the first African-American graduate of Vassar College Anita Florence Hemmings. Some 19th-century categorization schemes defined people by proportion of African ancestry: a person whose parents were black and white was classified as mulatto, with one black grandparent and three white as quadroon, and with one black great-grandparent and the remainder white as octoroon. The latter categories remained within an overall black or colored category, but before the Civil War, in Virginia and some other states, a person of one-eighth or less black ancestry was legally white.

Genealogists have begun to find plantation records, court records, land deeds and other sources to trace African-American families and individuals before 1870. As slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write, black families passed along oral histories, which have had great persistence. Similarly, Native Americans did not generally learn to read and write English, although some did in the nineteenth century. Until 1930, census enumerators used the terms free people of color and mulatto to classify people of apparent mixed race. When those terms were dropped, as a result of the lobbying by the Southern Congressional bloc, the Census Bureau used only the binary classifications of black or white, as was typical in segregated southern states.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What has helped geneologists researching slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Colonial records of French and Spanish slave ships and sales, and plantation records in all the former colonies</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What were slaves usually not allowed to do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">learn to read and write</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What replaced written records for black families?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">oral histories</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who caused the Census Burea to drop the terms free people of color and mulatto?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Southern Congressional bloc</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When were the terms mulatto and free people of color taken off the census?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1930</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>European colonists created treaties with Indigenous American tribes requesting the return of any runaway slaves. For example, in 1726, the British governor of New York exacted a promise from the Iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined them. This same promise was extracted from the Huron Nation in 1764, and from the Delaware Nation in 1765, though there is no record of slaves ever being returned. Numerous advertisements requested the return of African Americans who had married Indigenous Americans or who spoke an Indigenous American language. The primary exposure that Africans and Indigenous Americans had to each other came through the institution of slavery. Indigenous Americans learned that Africans had what Indigenous Americans considered 'Great Medicine' in their bodies because Africans were virtually immune to the Old-World diseases that were decimating most native populations. Because of this, many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups, to create stronger, healthier children from the unions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Who did colonists ask for help in returning runaway slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Indigenous American tribes</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was a treaty with the Iroquis made to return slaves?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">1726</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What asked for the return of slaves who married indigenous americans or spoke their language?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Numerous advertisements</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">How did natives and Africans come to know each other?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">through the institution of slavery</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Why did natives consider Africans to have a 'Great Medicine'?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">because Africans were virtually immune to the Old-World diseases</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Interracial relationships, common-law marriages, and marriages occurred since the earliest colonial years, especially before slavery hardened as a racial caste associated with people of African descent in the British colonies. Virginia and other English colonies passed laws in the 17th century that gave children the social status of their mother, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, regardless of the father's race or citizenship. This overturned the principle in English common law by which a man gave his status to his children – this had enabled communities to demand that fathers support their children, whether legitimate or not. The change increased white men's ability to use slave women sexually, as they had no responsibility for the children. As master as well as father of mixed-race children born into slavery, the men could use these people as servants or laborers or sell them as slaves. In some cases, white fathers provided for their multiracial children, paying or arranging for education or apprenticeships and freeing them, particularly during the two decades following the American Revolution. (The practice of providing for the children was more common in French and Spanish colonies, where a class of free people of color developed who became educated and property owners.) Many other white fathers abandoned the mixed-race children and their mothers to slavery.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did the laws passed in the 17th century do?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">gave children the social status of their mother</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the rule called that causes a father's race to not matter?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">partus sequitur ventrem</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What did white fathers do after the American Revolution to provide for mixed children?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">paying or arranging for education or apprenticeships and freeing them</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">English common law generally said what?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">a man gave his status to his children</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many Latin American migrants have been mestizo, Amerindian, or other mixed race.

In addition, an example of African slaves' escaping from European colonists and being absorbed by Indigenous Americans occurred as far back as 1526. In June of that year, Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon established a Spanish colony near the mouth of the Pee Dee River in what is now eastern South Carolina. The Spanish settlement was named San Miguel de Gualdape. Amongst the settlement were 100 enslaved Africans.
