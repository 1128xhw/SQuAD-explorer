It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as Opus Francigenum (&quot;French work&quot;) with the term Gothic first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is one time period in which Gothic architecture flourished?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">late medieval period</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What style of architecture did Gothic architecture evolve from?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romanesque architecture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What style of architecture came after the Gothic style?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Renaissance architecture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Gothic architecture style originate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">France</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Gothic architecture is known for being commonly used in cathedrals and churches, what is one example of a lesser known type of structure in which Gothic architecture has been used?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It is in the great churches and cathedrals and in a number of civic buildings that the Gothic style was expressed most powerfully, its characteristics lending themselves to appeals to the emotions, whether springing from faith or from civic pride.

Foremost were the Benedictines whose great abbey churches vastly outnumbered any others in France and England. A part of their influence was that towns developed around them and they became centers of culture, learning and commerce.

With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture.

Another early example is the nave and apse area of the Cathedral of Cefalù in 1131. The ribbed vault over the north transept at Durham Cathedral in England, built from 1128 to 1133, is probably earlier still and was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">The distinctive forms that describe Gothic architecture developed out of which style?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romanesque</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Barrel and groin vaults are examples of what kind of architecture?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Romanesque architecture</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of vaults were used in the Abbey of Saint-Étienne and Abbaye aux Dames?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">ribbed vaults</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">When was Durham Cathedral constructed?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">from 1128 to 1133</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What cathedral first made use of pointed arches in high vaults? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Durham Cathedral in England</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Basilica of Saint Denis is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the ambulatory remains intact.

The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic.

It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity.

The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the unique design feature of English cathedrals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their extreme length</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of transepts do English cathedrals often feature? </strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">double transepts</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What size of window is typically featured on the west end of English cathedrals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">very large</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Where are rose windows used on English cathedrals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the transept gables</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">On English cathedrals, where is a tower almost always found?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">at the crossing</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Romanesque architecture in Germany, Poland, the Czech Lands and Austria is characterised by its massive and modular nature. This is expressed in the Gothic architecture of Central Europe in the huge size of the towers and spires, often projected, but not always completed. The west front generally follows the French formula, but the towers are very much taller and, if complete, are surmounted by enormous openwork spires that are a regional feature. Because of the size of the towers, the section of the façade between them may appear narrow and compressed. The eastern end follows the French form. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. This is the case even when, as at Cologne, they have been modelled upon a French cathedral. German cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting transepts. There are also many hall churches (Hallenkirchen) without clerestory windows.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">In Germany, Poland and Austria Romanesque architecture is defined by its massive size and what other design element?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">modular nature</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What design style does Romanesque architecture in Germany, Poland, and Austria normally follow?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the French formula</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What does the eastern end of German Romanesque cathedrals typically emulate?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">follows the French form</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the distinguishing design element in German Gothic cathedrals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">their breadth and openness</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What are hall churches in German cathedrals known as?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">Hallenkirchen</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the Iberian Peninsula is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the 'Hallenkirche of Germany, as at the Church of the Batalha Monastery in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are Islamic architecture and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at Leon Cathedral, typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At Burgos Cathedral there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles.

The plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of &quot;armonìa&quot;, and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Colours and moldings define the architectural units rather than blending them. Italian cathedral façades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The façades have projecting open porches and occular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistry. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the fresco.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6 rightCol"><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the unique characteristic of Italian Gothic design?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the use of polychrome decoration</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What color are the columns of Italian Gothic cathedrals often painted?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the columns may be painted red</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What type of arches do they love to use in Venice?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">they loved flamboyant arches</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">Instead of rose windows, what type of windows do Italian cathedral facades usually feature?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">occular or wheel windows</span></p></li></ol></div><div class="qa-wrap"><p> <strong class="question">What is the preferred narrative medium for the interior of Italian cathedrals?</strong></p><ol class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Answer 1: </i><span class="answer">the fresco</span></p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Palais des Papes in Avignon is the best complete large royal palace, alongside the Royal palace of Olite, built during the 13th and 14th centuries for the kings of Navarre.
