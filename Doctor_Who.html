<html><body><div><h1>Doctor_Who</h1><h2>Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord—a space and time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need.</h2><h3>Who is the producer of Doctor Who?</h3><p>BBC</p><p>BBC</p><p>BBC</p><h3>What year did Doctor Who first show on TV?</h3><p>1963</p><p>1963</p><p>1963</p><h3>What is Doctor Who's space ship called?</h3><p>TARDIS</p><p>TARDIS</p><p>TARDIS</p><h3>What does the outside of the Tardis resemble?</h3><p>a blue British police box</p><p>a blue British police box</p><p>blue British police box</p><h3>What type/genre of TV show is Doctor Who?</h3><p>science-fiction</p><p>science-fiction</p><p>science-fiction</p><h2>The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film. The programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies, who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. The first series of the 21st century featured Christopher Eccleston in the title role and was produced by the BBC. Doctor Who also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including Torchwood (2006–2011) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007–2011), both created by Russell T Davies; K-9 (2009–2010); and a single pilot episode of K-9 and Company (1981). There also have been many spoofs and cultural references to the character in other media.</h2><h3>In what years did Doctor Who originally show on TV?</h3><p>1963 to 1989</p><p>1963 to 1989</p><p>1963 to 1989</p><h3>Who relaunched Doctor Who in 2005?</h3><p>Russell T Davies</p><p>2005</p><p>Russell T Davies</p><h3>What Doctor Who spin-off only made it as far as a pilot episode?</h3><p>K-9 and Company</p><p>K-9 and Company</p><p>K-9 and Company</p><h3>Who produced the Doctor Who revival series?</h3><p>BBC Wales</p><p>Russell T Davies</p><p>BBC Wales</p><h3>Who played Doctor Who in the revival series?</h3><p>Christopher Eccleston</p><p>Christopher Eccleston</p><p>Christopher Eccleston</p><h2>Twelve actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show, as well as the differing approach to the role that each brings, under the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation. The show's premise is that this is a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species. Each actor's portrayal differs, but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same storyline. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that, on occasion, different Doctors have met each other. Peter Capaldi took on the role after Matt Smith's exit in the 2013 Christmas special &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;.</h2><h3>How many actors have played Doctor Who?</h3><p>Twelve</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Twelve</p><h3>Who followed Matt Smith in the role of Doctor Who?</h3><p>Peter Capaldi</p><p>Peter Capaldi</p><p>Peter Capaldi</p><h3>Which episode was Matt Smith's final one as Doctor Who?</h3><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><p>the 2013 Christmas special &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;</p><h3>When does Doctor Who transition to a new body?</h3><p>after sustaining an injury</p><p>after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species</p><p>after sustaining an injury</p><h3>In addition to a new body, what else changes about the Doctor?</h3><p>new personality</p><p>new personality</p><p>new personality</p><h2>Doctor Who follows the adventures of the primary character, a rogue Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who simply goes by the name &quot;The Doctor&quot;. He fled from Gallifrey in a stolen Mark I Type 40 TARDIS – &quot;Time and Relative Dimension in Space&quot; – time machine which allows him to travel across time and space. The TARDIS has a &quot;chameleon circuit&quot; which normally allows the machine to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise. However, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British Police box due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit.</h2><h3>What planet is Doctor Who from?</h3><p>Gallifrey</p><p>Gallifrey</p><p>Gallifrey</p><h3>What vehicle did Doctor Who use for his escape from Gallifrey?</h3><p>Mark I Type 40 TARDIS</p><p>Mark I Type 40 TARDIS</p><p>Mark I Type 40 TARDIS</p><h3>That does TARDIS stand for?</h3><p>Time and Relative Dimension in Space</p><p>Time and Relative Dimension in Space</p><p>Time and Relative Dimension in Space</p><h3>What feature normally allows the TARDIS to disguise itself?</h3><p>chameleon circuit</p><p>chameleon circuit</p><p>chameleon circuit</p><h3>Why does Doctor Who's TARDIS always look the same?</h3><p>due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit</p><p>malfunction in the chameleon circuit</p><p>a malfunction in the chameleon circuit</p><h2>The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more companions to share these adventures. His companions are usually humans, as he has found a fascination with planet Earth. He often finds events that pique his curiosity as he tries to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only his ingenuity and minimal resources, such as his versatile sonic screwdriver. As a Time Lord, the Doctor has the ability to regenerate when his body is mortally damaged, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during his travels, including the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master, another renegade Time Lord.</h2><h3>How often does Doctor Who travel by himself?</h3><p>rarely</p><p>often</p><p>rarely</p><h3>What enemy of Doctor Who is also a Time Lord?</h3><p>the Master</p><p>the Master</p><p>the Master</p><h3>What does Doctor Who do when his body is mortally damaged?</h3><p>regenerate</p><p>regenerate</p><p>regenerate</p><h3>What type of beings does Doctor Who usually take with him on his travels?</h3><p>humans</p><p>companions</p><p>usually humans</p><h3>What type of Lord is Doctor Who?</h3><p>Time Lord</p><p>Time</p><p>Time Lord</p><h2>Doctor Who first appeared on BBC TV at 17:16:20 GMT, eighty seconds after the scheduled programme time, 5:15 pm, on Saturday, 23 November 1963. It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any &quot;bug-eyed monsters&quot;. The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; &quot;We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.&quot; Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.</h2><h3>What was the date of the very first episode of Doctor Who?</h3><p>23 November 1963</p><p>Saturday, 23 November 1963</p><p>23 November 1963</p><h3>What creatures were the most popular monsters in the series?</h3><p>The Daleks (a.k.a.

Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1. Although (as series co-star Sophie Aldred reported in the documentary Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS) it was effectively, if not formally, cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed that the series would return.</h2><h3>How many seasons did the BBC produce Doctor Who?</h3><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><h3>Who ended the series in 1989?</h3><p>Jonathan Powell</p><p>Jonathan Powell</p><p>Jonathan Powell</p><h3>What documentary was shown about Doctor Who?</h3><p>Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS</p><p>Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS</p><p>Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS</p><h3>After cancelling the show, what did the BBC tell the public?</h3><p>the series would return</p><p>the series would return</p><p>the series would return</p><h3>What TV station showed the broadcasts of the original Doctor Who series?</h3><p>BBC 1</p><p>BBC 1</p><p>BBC 1</p><h2>While in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th series was still in production. Segal's negotiations eventually led to a Doctor Who television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.</h2><h3>What was the BBC hoping that an independent production firm would do for Doctor Who?</h3><p>relaunch the show</p><p>relaunch the show</p><p>relaunch the show</p><h3>Who approached the BBC in 1989 about relaunching the show?</h3><p>Philip Segal</p><p>Philip Segal</p><p>Philip Segal</p><h3>What network showed a Doctor Who film?</h3><p>the Fox Network</p><p>Fox Network</p><p>the Fox Network</p><h3>How many UK viewers watched the Doctor Who film?</h3><p>9.1 million</p><p>9.1 million</p><p>9.1 million</p><h3>In what country was the Doctor Who film not successful enough to spawn a series?</h3><p>the United States</p><p>United States</p><p>the United States</p><h2>Doctor Who finally returned with the episode &quot;Rose&quot; on BBC One on 26 March 2005. There have since been nine further series in 2006–2008 and 2010–2015, and Christmas Day specials every year since 2005. No full series was filmed in 2009, although four additional specials starring David Tennant were made. In 2010, Steven Moffat replaced Davies as head writer and executive producer. In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall in 2018. In addition, Series 10 will debut in Spring 2017, with a Christmas special broadcast in 2016.</h2><h3>What was the name of the first episode of the new Doctor Who series?</h3><p>Rose</p><p>Rose</p><p>Rose</p><h3>What year did Doctor Who finally return to television?</h3><p>2005</p><p>2005</p><p>2005</p><h3>What was the only year that a full series was not filmed since 2005?</h3><p>2009</p><p>2009</p><p>2009</p><h3>Who will be the new executive producer of Doctor Who in 2018?</h3><p>Chris Chibnall</p><p>Chris Chibnall</p><p>Chris Chibnall</p><h3>What type of special Doctor Who shows have been shown each year since 2005?</h3><p>Christmas Day specials</p><p>Christmas Day specials</p><p>Christmas Day specials</p><h2>The 2005 version of Doctor Who is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series[note 2] and the 1996 telefilm.

The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme &quot;Behind the Sofa&quot;. The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill &quot;at the center of many people's relationship with the show&quot;, and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the &quot;scariest TV show of all time&quot;.</h2><h3>What popular phrase is associated with the Doctor Who series?</h3><p>Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa</p><p>Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa</p><p>&quot;Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa&quot;</p><h3>Who put on a Doctor Who exhibition in 1991?</h3><p>the Museum of the Moving Image</p><p>Museum of the Moving Image</p><p>the Museum of the Moving Image</p><h3>What was the name of the 1991 Doctor Who exhibition?</h3><p>Behind the Sofa</p><p>Behind the Sofa</p><p>Behind the Sofa</p><h3>What did people vote the Doctor Who series as in a 2011 online vote?</h3><p>scariest TV show of all time</p><p>scariest TV show of all time</p><p>scariest TV show of all time</p><h3>Who conducted the 2011 online vote?</h3><p>Digital Spy</p><p>Digital Spy</p><p>Digital Spy</p><h2>A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence (&quot;any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental&quot;) Doctor Who was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time. The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as &quot;very unsuitable&quot; for family viewing. Responding to the findings of the survey in The Times newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, &quot;to compare the violence of Dr Who, sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously.&quot;</h2><h3>Which show was voted most violent of the BBC shows in a 1972 survey?</h3><p>Doctor Who</p><p>Doctor Who</p><p>Doctor Who</p><h3>How many of the survey respondents considered Doctor Who very unsuitable for family viewing?</h3><p>3%</p><p>3%</p><p>3%</p><h3>What journalist wrote an article defending Doctor Who?</h3><p>Philip Howard</p><p>Philip Howard</p><p>Philip Howard</p><h3>In his defense of Doctor Who, what did Philip Howard compare to the London property market?</h3><p>Monopoly</p><p>Monopoly</p><p>Monopoly</p><h3>What publication did Philip Howard work for?</h3><p>The Times newspaper</p><p>The Times</p><p>The Times newspaper</p><h2>The image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.

In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.</h2><h3>What image has become linked to Doctor Who?</h3><p>the TARDIS</p><p>the TARDIS</p><p>the TARDIS</p><h3>What does the TARDIS look like?</h3><p>blue police box</p><p>a police box</p><p>blue police box</p><h3>What is the function of the TARDIS?</h3><p>time machine</p><p>time machine</p><p>time machine</p><h3>Who filed an objection to the BBC using the blue police box in Doctor Who merchandise?</h3><p>the Metropolitan Police Authority</p><p>Metropolitan Police Authority</p><p>the Metropolitan Police Authority</p><h3>When did the BBC receive a favorable ruling on the trade mark claim?</h3><p>2002</p><p>2002</p><p>2002</p><h2>Doctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or &quot;serial&quot;) — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired in 12 episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot;, featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the 10-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for 14 episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a storyline, such as season 8 being devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master, season 16's quest for The Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian Trilogy.</h2><h3>How many seasons did the original Doctor Who run?</h3><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><h3>When was the last episode of the original series?</h3><p>6 December 1989</p><p>6 December 1989</p><p>6 December 1989</p><h3>How many episodes were in The Daleks' Master Plan?</h3><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><h3>What is the name of a Time Lord that Doctor Who has fought?</h3><p>The Master</p><p>The Master</p><p>The Master</p><h3>What was the focus of Season 20 of Doctor Who?</h3><p>Black Guardian Trilogy</p><p>Black Guardian Trilogy</p><p>Black Guardian Trilogy</p><h2>The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with each series usually consisting of 13 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day.

As in the early &quot;classic&quot; era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title.

This was first prompted by original star William Hartnell's poor health. The actual term &quot;regeneration&quot; was not initially conceived of until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration however; Hartnell's Doctor had merely described undergoing a &quot;renewal,&quot; and the Second Doctor underwent a &quot;change of appearance&quot;.[citation needed] The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.[citation needed]</h2><h3>What term is used to explain a change in the appearance of Doctor Who?</h3><p>regeneration</p><p>regeneration</p><p>renewal</p><h3>When was the term &quot;regeneration&quot; first used?</h3><p>the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration</p><p>the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration</p><p>the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration</p><h3>What first prompted the regeneration concept?</h3><p>William Hartnell's poor health</p><p>to permit the recasting of the main character</p><p>William Hartnell's poor health</p><h3>What term was used for the first regeneration?</h3><p>renewal</p><p>renewal</p><p>renewal</p><h3>What term was used for the second regeneration?</h3><p>change of appearance</p><p>change of appearance</p><p>change of appearance</p><h2>The serials The Deadly Assassin and Mawdryn Undead and the 1996 TV film would later establish that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. The episode &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set.</h2><h3>How many times can a Time Lord regenerate?</h3><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><h3>How many incarnations can a Time Lord have?</h3><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><h3>In what episode did Doctor Who get a new cycle of regenerations?</h3><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><h3>In what two serials was the number of regenerations set?</h3><p>The Deadly Assassin and Mawdryn Undead</p><p>Deadly Assassin and Mawdryn Undead</p><p>Deadly Assassin and Mawdryn Undead</p><h3>In what year did the film also mention the number of regenerations?</h3><p>1996</p><p>1996</p><p>1996</p><h2>In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, John Hurt guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;. He is shown in mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; to have been retroactively inserted into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors. Another example is from the 1986 serial The Trial of a Time Lord, where Michael Jayston portrayed the Valeyard, who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnation.</h2><h3>Who played the War Doctor?</h3><p>John Hurt</p><p>John Hurt</p><p>John Hurt</p><h3>What was the name of the 50th Anniversary show?</h3><p>The Day of the Doctor</p><p>The Day of the Doctor</p><p>The Day of the Doctor</p><h3>What actor played the Valeyard?</h3><p>Michael Jayston</p><p>Michael Jayston</p><p>Michael Jayston</p><h3>What was the name of the serial where the Valeyard appears?</h3><p>The Trial of a Time Lord</p><p>The Trial of a Time Lord</p><p>The Trial of a Time Lord</p><h3>What two Doctors does the War Doctor exist between?</h3><p>McGann and Eccleston's Doctors</p><p>McGann and Eccleston</p><p>McGann and Eccleston's</p><h2>There have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short &quot;Time Crash&quot; alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in &quot;Father's Day&quot;, and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in &quot;The Big Bang&quot;. In &quot;The Almost People&quot; the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as &quot;his secret&quot; and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.</h2><h3>What Doctor was first referred to as &quot;his secret&quot;?</h3><p>the War Doctor</p><p>an unknown incarnation of himself</p><p>the War Doctor</p><h3>Which episode featured the return of William Hartnell?</h3><p>The Three Doctors</p><p>The Three Doctors</p><p>The Three Doctors</p><h3>Which Doctor returned for the &quot;Children in Need&quot; show?</h3><p>Peter Davison</p><p>Peter Davison</p><p>Peter Davison</p><h3>In which episode does the First Doctor see himself?</h3><p>The Space Museum</p><p>The Space Museum</p><p>The Space Museum</p><h3>What was the name of the 50th Anniversary episode?</h3><p>The Day of the Doctor</p><p>The Day of the Doctor</p><p>The Day of the Doctor</p><h2>Additionally, multiple Doctors have returned in new adventures together in audio dramas based on the series. Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy appeared together in the 1999 audio adventure The Sirens of Time. To celebrate the 40th anniversary in 2003, an audio drama titled Zagreus featuring Paul McGann, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Peter Davison was released with additional archive recordings of Jon Pertwee. Again in 2003, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy appeared together in the audio adventure Project: Lazarus. In 2010, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann came together again to star in the audio drama The Four Doctors.</h2><h3>Which three doctors were in The Sirens of Time?</h3><p>Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy</p><p>Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy</p><p>Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy</p><h3>What special audio recording was released for the 40th anniversary?</h3><p>Zagreus</p><p>Zagreus</p><p>Zagreus</p><h3>Which Doctors were featured in The Four Doctors?</h3><p>Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann</p><p>Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann</p><p>Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann</p><h3>Which Doctors were in Project: Lazarus?</h3><p>Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy</p><p>Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy</p><p>Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy</p><h3>In what year was the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary show?</h3><p>2003</p><p>2003</p><p>2003</p><h2>Throughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In The Brain of Morbius (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor may not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In Mawdryn Undead (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special The Five Doctors, the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms &quot;Fourth&quot;, the First Doctor excitedly replies &quot;Goodness me. So there are five of me now.&quot; In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself &quot;the Eleventh&quot; in &quot;The Lodger&quot;. In the 2013 episode &quot;The Time of the Doctor,&quot; the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied &quot;Fall of the Eleventh&quot; which had been trailed throughout the series.</h2><h3>In what episode does the &quot;Fall of the Eleventh&quot; happen?</h3><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><h3>In what episode is it brought up that the First Doctor might not actually be the first Doctor?</h3><p>The Brain of Morbius</p><p>The Five Doctors</p><p>The Brain of Morbius</p><h3>In what episode was the Fifth Doctor confirmed?</h3><p>Mawdryn Undead</p><p>Mawdryn Undead</p><p>Mawdryn Undead</p><h3>In what episode does the Eleventh Doctor first acknowledge his number?</h3><p>The Lodger</p><p>The Lodger</p><p>The Time of the Doctor</p><h3>In what year was the 20th Anniversary special aired?</h3><p>1983</p><p>1983</p><p>1983</p><h2>The programme's first serial, An Unearthly Child, shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman. In the 1967 serial, Tomb of the Cybermen, when Victoria Waterfield doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, &quot;being so ancient&quot;, the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to—&quot;The rest of the time they sleep in my mind&quot;. The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in &quot;The Empty Child&quot; (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, &quot;Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.&quot; The Doctor remarks in response, &quot;Yeah, I know the feeling.&quot; In &quot;Smith and Jones&quot; (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, &quot;No, not any more.&quot; In both &quot;Fear Her&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Doctor's Daughter&quot; (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.</h2><h3>What is the name of the first Doctor Who serial?</h3><p>An Unearthly Child</p><p>An Unearthly Child</p><p>An Unearthly Child</p><h3>What is the name of Doctor Who granddaughter?</h3><p>Susan Foreman</p><p>Susan Foreman</p><p>Susan Foreman</p><h3>In what year did Doctor Who state that he was the last Time Lord?</h3><p>2005</p><p>2005</p><h3>In 2005, what did Doctor Who think the condition of his home planet was?</h3><p>destroyed</p><p>destroyed</p><p>destroyed</p><h3>In what episode did Doctor Who acknowledge having had a brother?</h3><p>Smith and Jones</p><p>Smith and Jones</p><p>Smith and Jones</p><h2>The companion figure – generally a human – has been a constant feature in Doctor Who since the programme's inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to remind the Doctor of his &quot;moral duty&quot;. The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin. Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.</h2><h3>What type of creature is usually Doctor Who's companion?</h3><p>a human</p><p>a human</p><p>usually human, or humanoid aliens</p><h3>What is the only story of the original series where Doctor Who travels alone?</h3><p>The Deadly Assassin</p><p>The Deadly Assassin</p><p>The Deadly Assassin</p><h3>What relative of Doctor Who traveled with him in the early episodes?</h3><p>his granddaughter Susan Foreman</p><p>Susan Foreman</p><p>his granddaughter</p><h3>What was the occupation of Doctor Who's other (non-related) companions?</h3><p>teachers</p><p>to remind the Doctor of his &quot;moral duty&quot;</p><p>teachers</p><h3>What was the name of the character known as the Time Lady?</h3><p>Romana</p><p>Romana</p><p>Sarah Jane Smith</p><h2>Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor. The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs. The tenth series will introduce Pearl Mackie as Bill, the Doctor's newest traveling companion.</h2><h3>Since 2005, what is the gender of Doctor Who's primary traveling companion?</h3><p>female</p><p>female</p><p>female</p><h3>Who were the secondary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors?</h3><p>Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman)</p><p>Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman)</p><p>Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman)</p><h3>Who was the first Doctor to travel with a married couple?</h3><p>The Eleventh</p><p>The Eleventh Doctor</p><p>The Eleventh Doctor</p><h3>Who is the new companion for the 10th series of the revival?</h3><p>Pearl Mackie as Bill</p><p>Pearl Mackie</p><p>Pearl Mackie as Bill</p><h3>Who played the companion named Donna Noble?</h3><p>Catherine Tate</p><p>Catherine Tate</p><p>Catherine Tate</p><h2>With the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce classic icons of Doctor Who one step at a time: the Autons with the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, the Macra and the Master in series 3, the Sontarans and Davros in series 4, and the Time Lords (Rassilon) in the 2009–10 Specials. Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the Silurians in series 5, Cybermats in series 6, the Great Intelligence and the Ice Warriors in Series 7, and Zygons in the 50th Anniversary Special. Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: Slitheen (Raxacoricofallapatorian), Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels and the Silence.</h2><h3>Who was the executive producer of the 2005 Doctor Who revival series?</h3><p>Russell T Davies</p><p>Russell T Davies</p><p>Russell T Davies</p><h3>When were the Daleks reintroduced in the revival series?</h3><p>series 1</p><p>series 1</p><p>series 1,</p><h3>What icons were reintroduced in series 2 of the revival show?</h3><p>Cybermen</p><p>Cybermen</p><p>Cybermen</p><h3>In what series was the Master reintroduced?</h3><p>3</p><p>series 3</p><p>3</p><h3>Who was reintroduced for the 50th Anniversary special?</h3><p>Zygons</p><p>Zygons</p><p>Zygons</p><h2>The Dalek race, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963, are Doctor Who's oldest villains. The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to &quot;exterminate&quot; all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearances being in the 2015 episodes &quot;The Witch's Familiar&quot; and &quot;Hell Bent&quot;. Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in Genesis of the Daleks, although played by several different actors.</h2><h3>Who are the oldest villains from the Doctor Who series? </h3><p>The Dalek race</p><p>The Dalek race</p><p>The Dalek race</p><h3>What planet do the Daleks come from?</h3><p>Skaro</p><p>Skaro</p><p>Skaro</p><h3>What is the primary mission of the Daleks?</h3><p>to &quot;exterminate&quot; all non-Dalek beings</p><p>to &quot;exterminate&quot; all non-Dalek beings</p><p>to &quot;exterminate&quot; all non-Dalek beings</p><h3>What scientist created the Daleks, by mutation?</h3><p>Davros</p><p>Davros</p><p>Davros</p><h3>What is the Daleks' main weakness?</h3><p>their eyestalk</p><p>their eyestalk</p><p>their eyestalk</p><h2>The Master is the Doctor's archenemy, a renegade Time Lord who desires to rule the universe. Conceived as &quot;Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes&quot;, the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of Doctor Who, and was played by American actor Eric Roberts.</h2><h3>Who is the archenemy of Doctor Who?</h3><p>The Master</p><p>The Master</p><p>The Master</p><h3>What title do both Doctor Who and the Master share?</h3><p>Time Lord</p><p>Time Lord</p><p>Time Lord</p><h3>Who played the Master in the 1996 TV movie?</h3><p>Eric Roberts</p><p>Eric Roberts</p><p>Eric Roberts</p><h3>What literary reference compares the Master to Doctor Who?</h3><p>Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes</p><p>Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes</p><p>Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes</p><h3>Who was the first person to play the Master?</h3><p>Roger Delgado</p><p>Roger Delgado</p><p>Roger Delgado</p><h2>Following the series revival in 2005, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode &quot;Utopia&quot;.

As of the 2014 episode &quot;Dark Water,&quot; it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or &quot;Time Lady,&quot; going by the name of &quot;Missy&quot; (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of &quot;Master&quot;).

The various parts were built up using musique concrète techniques, by creating tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test oscillators and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–80). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, &quot;Did I write that?&quot;[citation needed]</h2><h3>Who composed the original Doctor Who theme?</h3><p>Ron Grainer</p><p>Ron Grainer</p><p>Ron Grainer</p><h3>What workshop helped with the creation of the Doctor Who theme?</h3><p>the BBC Radiophonic Workshop</p><p>BBC Radiophonic Workshop</p><p>the BBC Radiophonic Workshop</p><h3>What kind of techniques were used to create the theme?</h3><p>musique concrète</p><p>musique concrète techniques</p><p>musique concrète techniques</p><h3>When was the last season that this original theme was used?</h3><p>17</p><p>season 17</p><p>17</p><h3>Upon hearing the final product, what was the creator quoted as saying?</h3><p>Did I write that?</p><p>Did I write that?</p><p>Did I write that?</p><h2>A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 (1986). Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for Doctor Who in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;, Gold introduced a modified closing credits arrangement that was used up until the conclusion of the 2007 series.[citation needed]</h2><h3>Who recorded the theme played for season 18?</h3><p>Peter Howell</p><p>Peter Howell</p><p>Peter Howell</p><h3>Who created the theme used in 1986?</h3><p>Dominic Glynn</p><p>Dominic Glynn</p><p>Dominic Glynn's</p><h3>For which Doctor did Keff McCulloch provide the theme?</h3><p>Seventh</p><p>the Seventh Doctor</p><p>the Seventh</p><h3>Who created the 2005 theme for Doctor Who?</h3><p>Murray Gold</p><p>Murray Gold</p><p>Murray Gold</p><h3>In what show did Murray Gold modify the closing credits theme?</h3><p>The Christmas Invasion</p><p>The Christmas Invasion</p><p>The Christmas Invasion</p><h2>A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series.

In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, &quot;Who Is the Doctor&quot;.[note 6] In 1978 a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF) released the single &quot;Doctorin' the Tardis&quot; under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot; by Gary Glitter (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of &quot;Doctorin' the Tardis&quot;). Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on The Chaser's War on Everything. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.

A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006. A Doctor Who Prom was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Proms. The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time. The event was presented by Freema Agyeman and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;, written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.</h2><h3>Who has performed all the Doctor Who music since the 2005 Christmas special?</h3><p>the BBC National Orchestra of Wales</p><p>BBC National Orchestra of Wales</p><p>the BBC National Orchestra of Wales</p><h3>Who performed a benefit concert for the charity Children in Need?</h3><p>the BBC National Orchestra of Wales</p><p>BBC National Orchestra of Wales</p><p>the BBC National Orchestra of Wales</p><h3>When was a Doctor Who Prom performed?</h3><p>27 July 2008</p><p>27 July 2008</p><p>27 July 2008</p><h3>What Doctor Who mini-episode was shown during the Prom?</h3><p>Music of the Spheres</p><p>Music of the Spheres</p><p>Music of the Spheres</p><h3>Who has composed the Doctor Who incidental music since 2005?</h3><p>Murray Gold and Ben Foster</p><p>Murray Gold and Ben Foster</p><p>Murray Gold and Ben Foster</p><h2>Six soundtrack releases have been released since 2005.

The logo from 1973–80 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure. The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season. The logo used for the Ninth Doctor was slightly edited for the Tenth Doctor, but it retained the same general appearance. The logo used for the Eleventh Doctor had the &quot;DW&quot; TARDIS insignia placed to the right in 2012, but the same font remained, albeit with a slight edit to the texture every episode, with the texture relating to some aspect of the story. The logo for the Twelfth Doctor had the &quot;DW&quot; TARDIS insignia removed and the font was subtly altered, as well as made slightly larger. As of 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors, and the current Doctor Who logo is used for all merchandise relating to the current Doctor.</h2><h3>What logo was modified and reused for the 50th Anniversary special?</h3><p>The original logo</p><p>The original logo used for the First Doctor</p><p>The original logo</p><h3>Which logo had the DW Tardis insignia removed?</h3><p>The logo for the Twelfth Doctor</p><p>The logo for the Twelfth Doctor</p><p>The logo for the Twelfth Doctor</p><h3>What logo is used for all merchandise that features past Doctors?</h3><p>the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors</p><p>the Third and Eighth Doctors</p><p>the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors</p><h3>Which logo was used for the third Doctor Who's last season?</h3><p>The logo from 1973–80</p><p>The logo from 1973–80</p><p>The logo from 1973–80</p><h3>Which Doctor was the current Doctor during the 50th Anniversary special?</h3><p>the Eleventh Doctor</p><p>the Eleventh Doctor</p><p>the Eleventh</p><h2>Premiering the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the first episode of Doctor Who was repeated with the second episode the following week. Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes are now repeated on BBC Three. The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings. The first of these was the &quot;Dalekmania&quot; period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them. The second was the late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million.</h2><h3>The first episode of Doctor Who premiered the day after what famous event in history?</h3><p>the assassination of John F.

Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera Coronation Street, the most popular show at the time. After the series' revival in 2005 (the third notable period of high ratings), it has consistently had high viewership levels for the evening on which the episode is broadcast.</h2><h3>When was Doctor Who viewing at its highest level?</h3><p>During the ITV network strike of 1979</p><p>During the ITV network strike of 1979</p><p>1979</p><h3>What was the main reason for the show's suspension in 1989?</h3><p>Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers</p><p>performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor</p><p>performance</p><h3>Fans blame the poor viewership of the late 80's to competition from what show?</h3><p>Coronation Street</p><p>Coronation Street</p><p>Coronation Street</p><h3>How popular was Coronation Street in the late 80's?</h3><p>the most popular show at the time</p><p>the most popular show</p><p>the most popular show at the time</p><h3>When was the third period of high viewership for the Doctor Who series?</h3><p>After the series' revival in 2005</p><p>the series' revival in 2005</p><p>2005</p><h2>Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One.

The 2013 series Destiny of the Doctor, produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show.</h2><h3>Which Doctors were highlighted on the first audio releases on CD?</h3><p>the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors</p><p>Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors</p><p>the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors</p><h3>What series featured Doctors from the revised version of Doctor Who?</h3><p>Destiny of the Doctor</p><p>The 2013 series</p><p>Destiny of the Doctor</p><h3>What company released the CD versions of the Doctor Who stories?</h3><p>Big Finish Productions</p><p>Big Finish Productions</p><p>Big Finish Productions</p><h3>What year were the first Doctor Who stories available on CD?</h3><p>1999</p><p>1999</p><p>1999</p><h3>When did the Fourth Doctor appear on CD?</h3><p>2012</p><p>2012</p><p>2012</p><h2>Doctor Who books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the Virgin New Adventures and Virgin Missing Adventures. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by BBC Books. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated Doctor Who Magazine with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979. This is published by Panini, as is the Doctor Who Adventures magazine for younger fans.</h2><h3>In what year did original fiction featuring Doctor Who appear?</h3><p>1991</p><p>1991</p><p>1991</p><h3>When were the earliest Doctor Who books available?</h3><p>the mid-sixties</p><p>the mid-sixties</p><p>1965</p><h3>How long has the Doctor Who Magazine been in circulation?</h3><p>since 1979</p><p>1979</p><p>since 1979</p><h3>Who is the publisher of the Doctor Who Adventures magazine?</h3><p>Panini</p><p>Panini</p><p>Panini</p><h3>Who began publishing Doctor Who novels in 2005?</h3><p>BBC Books</p><p>BBC Books</p><p>BBC Books</p><h2>Since the creation of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances. In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.</h2><h3>When was Doctor Who created?</h3><p>the early 1960s</p><p>the early 1960s</p><p>the early 1960s</p><h3>What company created Doctor Who?</h3><p>BBC Television</p><p>BBC Television</p><p>BBC Television</p><h3>Who has expressed distaste for the canonicity of Doctor Who stories by other media?</h3><p>producers of the show</p><p>producers of the show</p><p>producers of the show</p><h3>Who does not take a position on the canonicity of Doctor Who stories by other media?</h3><p>the BBC</p><p>the BBC</p><p>the BBC</p><h2>The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer.
