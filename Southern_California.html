<html><body><div><h1>Southern_California</h1><h2>Southern California, often abbreviated SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's southernmost 10 counties. The region is traditionally described as &quot;eight counties&quot;, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, including Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States.</h2><h3>What is Southern California often abbreviated as?</h3><p>SoCal</p><p>SoCal</p><p>SoCal</p><h3>Despite being traditionall described as &quot;eight counties&quot;, how many counties does this region actually have?</h3><p>10 counties</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><h3>What is a major importance of Southern California in relation to California and the United States?</h3><p>economic center</p><p>major economic center</p><p>economic center</p><h3>What are the ties that best described what the &quot;eight counties&quot; are based on?</h3><p>demographics and economic ties</p><p>economic</p><p>demographics and economic</p><h3>The reasons for the las two counties to be added are based on what?</h3><p>historical political divisions</p><p>historical political divisions</p><p>historical political divisions</p><h2>The 8- and 10-county definitions are not used for the greater Southern California Megaregion, one of the 11 megaregions of the United States.

Southern California's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas, or MSAs: the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties; the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties; the San Diego metropolitan area; the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura metropolitan area; the Santa Barbara metro area; the San Luis Obispo metropolitan area; and the El Centro area. Out of these, three are heavy populated areas: the Los Angeles area with over 12 million inhabitants, the Riverside-San Bernardino area with over four million inhabitants, and the San Diego area with over 3 million inhabitants. For CSA metropolitan purposes, the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people. With over 22 million people, southern California contains roughly 60 percent of California's population.</h2><h3>Which coastline does Southern California touch?</h3><p>Pacific</p><p>Pacific</p><p>Pacific</p><h3>How many metropolitan areas does Southern California's population encompass?</h3><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><h3>How many inhabitants does the Los Angeles area contain?</h3><p>12 million</p><p>over 12 million inhabitants</p><p>12 million</p><h3>Which of the three heavily populated areas has the least number of inhabitants?</h3><p>San Diego</p><p>the San Diego area</p><p>San Diego</p><h3>How many people does the Greater Los Angeles Area have?</h3><p>17.5 million</p><p>over 17.5 million</p><p>17.5 million</p><h2>To the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River at the border with Arizona, and the Mojave Desert at the border with the state of Nevada.

Professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, professional surfers Rob Machado, Tim Curran, Bobby Martinez, Pat O'Connell, Dane Reynolds, and Chris Ward, and professional snowboarder Shaun White live in southern California. Some of the world's legendary surf spots are in southern California as well, including Trestles, Rincon, The Wedge, Huntington Beach, and Malibu, and it is second only to the island of Oahu in terms of famous surf breaks. Some of the world's biggest extreme sports events, including the X Games, Boost Mobile Pro, and the U.S. Open of Surfing are all in southern California. Southern California is also important to the world of yachting. The annual Transpacific Yacht Race, or Transpac, from Los Angeles to Hawaii, is one of yachting's premier events. The San Diego Yacht Club held the America's Cup, the most prestigious prize in yachting, from 1988 to 1995 and hosted three America's Cup races during that time.</h2><h3>Other than surf, what other culture is southern California home to?</h3><p>skateboard</p><p>skateboard</p><p>skateboard</p><h3>What is the name of the professional skateboarder that lives in southern California?</h3><p>Tony Hawk</p><p>Tony Hawk</p><p>Tony Hawk</p><h3>What famous snowbaorder lives in southern California?</h3><p>Shaun White</p><p>Shaun White</p><p>Shaun White</p><h3>Southern California is second to which island in terms of famous serf breaks?</h3><p>Oahu</p><p>Oahu</p><p>Oahu</p><h3>What is the shortened name of the annual yacht race that takes place?</h3><p>Transpac</p><p>Transpac</p><p>Transpac</p><h2>Many locals and tourists frequent the southern California coast for its popular beaches, and the desert city of Palm Springs is popular for its resort feel and nearby open spaces.</h2><h3>What is the name of the desert city?</h3><p>Palm Springs</p><p>Palm Springs</p><p>Palm Springs</p><h3>Other than the desert city why do many locals and tourists frequent southern California?</h3><p>beaches</p><p>for its popular beaches</p><p>beaches</p><h3>Which region of California is Palm Springs located in?</h3><p>southern</p><p>the desert</p><p>southern</p><h3>Other than for its resort feel, what is Palm Springs popular for?</h3><p>open spaces</p><p>nearby open spaces</p><p>nearby open spaces</p><h2>&quot;Southern California&quot; is not a formal geographic designation, and definitions of what constitutes southern California vary. Geographically, California's north-south midway point lies at exactly 37° 9' 58.23&quot; latitude, around 11 miles (18 km) south of San Jose; however, this does not coincide with popular use of the term. When the state is divided into two areas (northern and southern California), the term &quot;southern California&quot; usually refers to the ten southern-most counties of the state. This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35° 47′ 28″ north latitude, which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties. Another definition for southern California uses Point Conception and the Tehachapi Mountains as the northern boundary.</h2><h3>Geographically speaking, where is California's north - south midway point in terms of latitude?</h3><p>37° 9' 58.23&quot;</p><p>37° 9' 58.23&quot;</p><p>37° 9' 58.23&quot;</p><h3>How many miles south of San Jose is the north - south midway point located?</h3><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><h3>The term &quot;southern&quot; California usually refers to how many of the southern-most counties of the state?</h3><p>ten</p><p>ten</p><p>ten</p><h3>Other than Point Conception, what landmark is used in the other definition of southern California?</h3><p>Tehachapi Mountains</p><p>Tehachapi Mountains</p><h3>Point Conception is an example of a landmark among what boundary of southern California?</h3><p>northern</p><p>the Tehachapi Mountains</p><p>northern</p><h2>Though there is no official definition for the northern boundary of southern California, such a division has existed from the time when Mexico ruled California, and political disputes raged between the Californios of Monterey in the upper part and Los Angeles in the lower part of Alta California. Following the acquisition of California by the United States, the division continued as part of the attempt by several pro-slavery politicians to arrange the division of Alta California at 36 degrees, 30 minutes, the line of the Missouri Compromise. Instead, the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state, preventing southern California from becoming its own separate slave state.</h2><h3>Which country used to rule California?</h3><p>Mexico</p><p>Mexico</p><p>Mexico</p><h3>Los Angeles is in the lower part of what?</h3><p>Alta California</p><p>Alta California</p><p>Alta California</p><h3>Which Californio is located in the upper part?</h3><p>Monterey</p><p>Monterey</p><p>Monterey</p><h3>What was the name of the legislation passed in 1850?</h3><p>the Missouri Compromise</p><p>the Compromise of 1850</p><p>Compromise of 1850</p><h3>The legislation allowed California to be admitted to the Union as what kind of state?</h3><p>free</p><p>a free state</p><p>free</p><h2>Subsequently, Californios (dissatisfied with inequitable taxes and land laws) and pro-slavery southerners in the lightly populated &quot;Cow Counties&quot; of southern California attempted three times in the 1850s to achieve a separate statehood or territorial status separate from Northern California. The last attempt, the Pico Act of 1859, was passed by the California State Legislature and signed by the State governor John B. Weller. It was approved overwhelmingly by nearly 75% of voters in the proposed Territory of Colorado. This territory was to include all the counties up to the then much larger Tulare County (that included what is now Kings, most of Kern, and part of Inyo counties) and San Luis Obispo County. The proposal was sent to Washington, D.C. with a strong advocate in Senator Milton Latham. However, the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote.</h2><h3>Other than land laws, what else were the Californios dissatisfied with?</h3><p>inequitable taxes</p><p>inequitable taxes</p><p>inequitable taxes</p><h3>What was the name given to the regions in which the pro - slavery southerners lived?</h3><p>Cow Counties</p><p>Cow Counties</p><p>Cow Counties</p><h3>How many times did southern California attempt to achieve a separate statehood?</h3><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><h3>What was the percentage of people that voted in favor of the Pico Act of 1859?</h3><p>75</p><p>75%</p><p>75</p><h3>Which Senator was a strong advocate for the Pico Act?</h3><p>Milton Latham</p><p>Milton Latham</p><p>Milton Latham</p><h2>In 1900, the Los Angeles Times defined southern California as including &quot;the seven counties of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura and Santa Barbara.&quot; In 1999, the Times added a newer county—Imperial—to that list.</h2><h3>Which newspaper defined southern California?</h3><p>Los Angeles Times</p><p>the Los Angeles Times</p><p>Los Angeles Times</p><h3>In which year did the newspaper define southern California?</h3><p>1900</p><p>1900</p><p>1900</p><h3>In which year did the newspaper change its previous definition?</h3><p>1999</p><p>1999</p><p>1999</p><h3>What was the newer county added to the list?</h3><p>Imperial</p><p>Imperial</p><p>1999</p><h3>How many counties initially made up the definition of southern California?</h3><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><p>seven</p><h2>The state is most commonly divided and promoted by its regional tourism groups as consisting of northern, central, and southern California regions. The two AAA Auto Clubs of the state, the California State Automobile Association and the Automobile Club of Southern California, choose to simplify matters by dividing the state along the lines where their jurisdictions for membership apply, as either northern or southern California, in contrast to the three-region point of view. Another influence is the geographical phrase South of the Tehachapis, which would split the southern region off at the crest of that transverse range, but in that definition, the desert portions of north Los Angeles County and eastern Kern and San Bernardino Counties would be included in the southern California region due to their remoteness from the central valley and interior desert landscape.</h2><h3>Which organizations most commonly divide and promote the state?</h3><p>regional tourism groups</p><p>regional tourism groups</p><p>AAA Auto Clubs</p><h3>Other than the Automobile Club of Southern California, what other AAA Auto Club chose to simplify the divide?</h3><p>California State Automobile Association</p><p>the California State Automobile Association</p><p>California State Automobile Association</p><h3>The two AAA clubs divided the state into a northern and southern California as opposed to what point of view?</h3><p>three-region</p><p>the three-region point of view</p><p>three-region</p><h3>Which mountain range influenced the split of the regions?</h3><p>Tehachapis</p><p>the Tehachapis</p><p>Tehachapis</p><h3>In the definition based off the mountain range, which region would the desert portions of north Los Angeles County be included in?</h3><p>southern</p><p>southern California</p><p>southern California</p><h2>Southern California consists of a heavily developed urban environment, home to some of the largest urban areas in the state, along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped.
