<html><body><div><h1>Warsaw</h1><h2>One of the most famous people born in Warsaw was Maria Skłodowska-Curie, who achieved international recognition for her research on radioactivity and was the first female recipient of the Nobel Prize. Famous musicians include Władysław Szpilman and Frédéric Chopin. Though Chopin was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, about 60 km (37 mi) from Warsaw, he moved to the city with his family when he was seven months old. Casimir Pulaski, a Polish general and hero of the American Revolutionary War, was born here in 1745.</h2><h3>What was Maria Curie the first female recipient of?</h3><p>Nobel Prize</p><p>Nobel Prize</p><p>Nobel Prize</p><h3>What year was Casimir Pulaski born in Warsaw?</h3><p>1745</p><p>1745</p><p>1745</p><h3>Who was one of the most famous people born in Warsaw?</h3><p>Maria Skłodowska-Curie</p><p>Maria Skłodowska-Curie</p><p>Maria Skłodowska-Curie</p><h3>Who was Frédéric Chopin?</h3><p>Famous musicians</p><p>musicians</p><p>Famous musicians</p><h3>How old was Chopin when he moved to Warsaw with his family?</h3><p>seven months old</p><p>seven months old</p><p>seven months old</p><h2>The Saxon Garden, covering the area of 15.5 ha, was formally a royal garden. There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The Łazienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilanów Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Królikarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.</h2><h3>Over how many species of trees can be found in the Saxon Garden?</h3><p>100</p><p>over 100</p><p>100</p><h3>What is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians?</h3><p>Krasiński Palace Garden</p><p>Krasiński Palace Garden</p><p>Krasiński Palace Garden</p><h3>What garden was formally only for royalty?</h3><p>The Saxon Garden</p><p>Saxon Garden</p><p>The Saxon Garden</p><h3>Which end of the Saxon Garden is the Tom of the Unknown Soldier located at?</h3><p>east end</p><p>east</p><p>east</p><h3>What park covers an area of 76 ha.?</h3><p>Łazienki</p><p>Łazienki Park</p><p>Łazienki Park</p><h2>There are 13 natural reserves in Warsaw – among others, Bielany Forest, Kabaty Woods, Czerniaków Lake. About 15 kilometres (9 miles) from Warsaw, the Vistula river's environment changes strikingly and features a perfectly preserved ecosystem, with a habitat of animals that includes the otter, beaver and hundreds of bird species. There are also several lakes in Warsaw – mainly the oxbow lakes, like Czerniaków Lake, the lakes in the Łazienki or Wilanów Parks, Kamionek Lake. There are lot of small lakes in the parks, but only a few are permanent – the majority are emptied before winter to clean them of plants and sediments.</h2><h3>How far from Warsaw does the Vistula river's environment change noticeably? </h3><p>15 kilometres</p><p>15 kilometres</p><p>About 15 kilometres</p><h3>What animals does the Vistula river's ecosystem include?</h3><p>otter, beaver and hundreds of bird species</p><p>otter, beaver and hundreds of bird species</p><p>otter, beaver and hundreds of bird species.</p><h3>How many natural reserves are in Warsaw?</h3><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><h3>How many lakes are there in Warsaw?</h3><p>several</p><p>several</p><p>several</p><h3>Why are the small lakes in the parks emptied before winter?</h3><p>to clean them</p><p>clean them</p><p>to clean them of plants and sediments</p><h2>Demographically, it was the most diverse city in Poland, with significant numbers of foreign-born inhabitants. In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent). Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history. Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation.</h2><h3>What was Warsaw the most diverse of in Poland?</h3><p>city</p><p>Demographically</p><p>city</p><h3>How many of Warsaw's inhabitants spoke Polish in 1933?</h3><p>833,500</p><p>833,500</p><p>833,500</p><h3>What percentage of the population of Warsaw was Jewish in 1897?</h3><p>around 34%</p><p>34</p><p>34%</p><h3>What was there a significant minority of in Warsaw?</h3><p>Jewish</p><p>Jewish</p><p>Jewish</p><h3>What is most of Warsaw's modern growth based on?</h3><p>migration and urbanisation</p><p>internal migration and urbanisation</p><p>internal migration and urbanisation.</p><h2>The University of Warsaw was established in 1816, when the partitions of Poland separated Warsaw from the oldest and most influential Polish academic center, in Kraków.

However, over the past decade Warsaw has seen many improvements due to solid economic growth, an increase in foreign investment as well as funding from the European Union. In particular, the city's metro, roads, sidewalks, health care facilities and sanitation facilities have improved markedly.</h2><h3>What suffered considerably for Warsaw when it had an Eastern Bloc economy?</h3><p>infrastructure</p><p>infrastructure</p><p>infrastructure</p><h3>What was a major success, especially in rebuilding Warsaw?</h3><p>Three-Year Plan</p><p>Three-Year Plan</p><p>Three-Year Plan</p><h3>Why has Warsaw seen many improvements over the past decade?</h3><p>solid economic growth</p><p>solid economic growth</p><p>economic growth</p><h3>Warsaw's sidewalks and sanitation facilities are some examples of things which have what?</h3><p>improved markedly</p><p>improved markedly</p><p>improved markedly</p><h2>Today, Warsaw has some of the best medical facilities in Poland and East-Central Europe.

Gatherings of thousands of people on the banks of the Vistula on Midsummer’s Night for a festival called Wianki (Polish for Wreaths) have become a tradition and a yearly event in the programme of cultural events in Warsaw. The festival traces its roots to a peaceful pagan ritual where maidens would float their wreaths of herbs on the water to predict when they would be married, and to whom. By the 19th century this tradition had become a festive event, and it continues today. The city council organize concerts and other events. Each Midsummer’s Eve, apart from the official floating of wreaths, jumping over fires, looking for the fern flower, there are musical performances, dignitaries' speeches, fairs and fireworks by the river bank.</h2><h3>What is the polish word for wreaths?</h3><p>Wianki</p><p>Wianki</p><p>Wianki</p><h3>How man people gather along the banks of the Vistula for the Wianki festival?</h3><p>thousands</p><p>thousands</p><p>thousands</p><h3>When is the Wianki festival held?</h3><p>Midsummer’s Night</p><p>Midsummer’s Night</p><p>Midsummer’s Night</p><h3>What will maidens be able to predict by floating their wreaths down the Vistula?</h3><p>when they would be married</p><p>when they would be married, and to whom</p><p>when they would be married,</p><h3>What type of flower is sought on Midsummer's Eve?</h3><p>the fern</p><p>fern</p><p>fern</p><h2>As interesting examples of expositions the most notable are: the world's first Museum of Posters boasting one of the largest collections of art posters in the world, Museum of Hunting and Riding and the Railway Museum.

The second mermaid reached the mouth of the Vistula River and plunged into its waters.

Due to its central location between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the &quot;Congress Kingdom&quot;. Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the &quot;Phoenix City&quot; because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).</h2><h3>When is the first reference in history to Warsaw?</h3><p>1313</p><p>1313</p><p>1313</p><h3>What city served as Poland's capital in 1313?</h3><p>Kraków</p><p>Kraków</p><p>Kraków</p><h3>When did Warsaw become the capital of the Kingdom of Poland?</h3><p>1596</p><p>1596</p><p>1596</p><h3>Who moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596?</h3><p>King Sigismund III Vasa</p><p>King Sigismund III Vasa</p><p>King Sigismund III Vasa</p><h3>Why did Warsaw gain the title of the &quot;Phoenix City&quot;?</h3><p>survived many wars, conflicts and invasions</p><p>it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions</p><p>because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history</p><h2>The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese (left bank of the Vistula) and diocese (right bank), and possesses various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw, two opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries and monuments.

Other main architectural attractions include the Castle Square with the Royal Castle and the iconic King Sigismund's Column, St. John's Cathedral, Market Square, palaces, churches and mansions all displaying a richness of colour and architectural detail.

Folk etymology attributes the city name to a fisherman, Wars, and his wife, Sawa. According to legend, Sawa was a mermaid living in the Vistula River with whom Wars fell in love. In actuality, Warsz was a 12th/13th-century nobleman who owned a village located at the modern-day site of Mariensztat neighbourhood. See also the Vršovci family which had escaped to Poland. The official city name in full is miasto stołeczne Warszawa (English: &quot;The Capital City of Warsaw&quot;). A native or resident of Warsaw is known as a Varsovian – in Polish warszawiak (male), warszawianka (female), warszawiacy (plural).</h2><h3>What is Warsaw's name in the Polish language?</h3><p>Warszawa</p><p>Warszawa</p><p>Warszawa</p><h3>What does Warszawa mean in Polish?</h3><p>belonging to Warsz</p><p>belonging to Warsz</p><p>belonging to Warsz</p><h3>Who was Warsz?</h3><p>12th/13th-century nobleman</p><p>shortened form of the masculine name of Slavic origin Warcisław</p><p>nobleman</p><h3>What did Warsz own?</h3><p>a village</p><p>village</p><h3>What is the full official city name of Warsaw?</h3><p>miasto stołeczne Warszawa</p><p>miasto stołeczne Warszawa</p><p>miasto stołeczne Warszawa</p><h2>The first fortified settlements on the site of today's Warsaw were located in Bródno (9th/10th century) and Jazdów (12th/13th century). After Jazdów was raided by nearby clans and dukes, a new similar settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called Warszowa. The Prince of Płock, Bolesław II of Masovia, established this settlement, the modern-day Warsaw, in about 1300. In the beginning of the 14th century it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia, becoming the official capital of Masovian Duchy in 1413. 14th-century Warsaw's economy rested on mostly crafts and trade. Upon the extinction of the local ducal line, the duchy was reincorporated into the Polish Crown in 1526.</h2><h3>What city, raided by clans and dukes, preceded the founding of Warszowa?</h3><p>Jazdów</p><p>Jazdów</p><p>Jazdów</p><h3>Who was Boleslaw II of Masovia?</h3><p>The Prince of Płock</p><p>Prince of Płock</p><p>Prince of Płock</p><h3>When was the settlement which would become Warsaw established?</h3><p>1300</p><p>1300</p><p>1300</p><h3>In what year did Warszowa become the official capital of the Masovian Duchy?</h3><p>1413</p><p>1413</p><p>1413</p><h3>When was the Masovian Duchy reincorporated into the Polish Crown?</h3><p>1526</p><p>1526</p><p>1526</p><h2>In 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of the General Sejm, permanent from 1569. In 1573 the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation, formally establishing religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to its central location between the Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596. In the following years the town expanded towards the suburbs. Several private independent districts were established, the property of aristocrats and the gentry, which were ruled by their own laws. Three times between 1655–1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces.</h2><h3>Who did Warsaw serve as the seat for in 1529?</h3><p>General Sejm</p><p>General Sejm</p><p>General Sejm</p><h3>When did the General Sejm make Warsaw it's permanent seat?</h3><p>1569</p><p>1569</p><p>1569</p><h3>What did the Warsaw Confederation formally establish in 1573?</h3><p>religious freedom</p><p>religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</p><p>religious freedom</p><h3>Why did Warsaw become the capital of the Commonwealth?</h3><p>Due to its central location</p><p>its central location</p><p>central location</p><h3>What year did King Sigismund III Vasa move his court to Warsaw?</h3><p>1596</p><p>1596</p><p>1596</p><h2>Warsaw remained the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1796, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia to become the capital of the province of South Prussia.

Germany did so, and underground leader Piłsudski returned to Warsaw on 11 November and set up what became the Second Polish Republic, with Warsaw the capital. In the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, the huge Battle of Warsaw was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city in which the capital was successfully defended and the Red Army defeated.

Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a German Nazi colonial administration. All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw's entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city – herded into the Warsaw Ghetto. The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe. When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler's &quot;Final Solution&quot; on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the Ghetto held out for almost a month.

Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived. Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began. The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days. Eventually the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate. They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled. Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.</h2><h3>What army was pushing deep into Polish territory to pursue the Germans in 1944?</h3><p>the Red Army</p><p>Red Army</p><p>e Red Army</p><h3>Why did the exiled Polish government in London order the underground Home Army to seize control of Warsaw prior to the arrival of the Red Army?</h3><p>Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland</p><p>Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland</p><p>Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland</p><h3>When did the Warsaw Uprising begin?</h3><p>August 1944</p><p>the Red Army was nearing the city</p><p>1 August 1944</p><h3>How many days did the Warsaw Uprising last?</h3><p>63 days</p><p>63</p><p>63 days</p><h3>What is the estimated death toll for Polish civilians? </h3><p>between 150,000 and 200,000</p><p>between 150,000 and 200,000</p><p>between 150,000 and 200,000</p><h2>After World War II, under a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets, the &quot;Bricks for Warsaw&quot; campaign was initiated, and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the housing shortage, along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city, such as the Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet Union. The city resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country's centre of political and economic life. Many of the historic streets, buildings, and churches were restored to their original form.

The city straddles the Vistula River. It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain, and its average elevation is 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level. The highest point on the left side of the city lies at a height of 115.7 metres (379.6 ft) (&quot;Redutowa&quot; bus depot, district of Wola), on the right side – 122.1 metres (400.6 ft) (&quot;Groszówka&quot; estate, district of Wesoła, by the eastern border). The lowest point lies at a height 75.6 metres (248.0 ft) (at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw). There are some hills (mostly artificial) located within the confines of the city – e.g. Warsaw Uprising Hill (121 metres (397.0 ft)), Szczęśliwice hill (138 metres (452.8 ft) – the highest point of Warsaw in general).</h2><h3>How many kilometers is Warsaw from the Carpathian Mountains?</h3><p>about 300</p><p>300</p><p>300</p><h3>How many miles east of Berlin is Warsaw?</h3><p>325</p><p>325</p><p>325</p><h3>What river does Warsaw straddle?</h3><p>Vistula River</p><p>Vistula</p><p>Vistula</p><h3>How high is the highest point in Warsaw?</h3><p>452.8 ft</p><p>115.7 metres</p><p>115.7 metres</p><h3>Where is the lowest point of Warsaw located?</h3><p>at the right bank of the Vistula</p><p>at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw</p><p>by the eastern border</p><h2>Warsaw is located on two main geomorphologic formations: the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley with its asymmetrical pattern of different terraces.

The left one is situated both on the moraine plateau (10 to 25 m (32.8 to 82.0 ft) above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. 6.5 m (21.3 ft) above Vistula level). The significant element of the relief, in this part of Warsaw, is the edge of moraine plateau called Warsaw Escarpment. It is 20 to 25 m (65.6 to 82.0 ft) high in the Old Town and Central district and about 10 m (32.8 ft) in the north and south of Warsaw.

They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the plain Vistula terraces (flooded as well as former flooded once) and only small part and not so visible moraine escarpment.

During the Second World War, Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction. After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL. Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed. However, some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. Leopold Kronenberg Palace). Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries.</h2><h3>What does Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflect?</h3><p>turbulent history of the city</p><p>turbulent history of the city and country</p><p>turbulent history of the city</p><h3>When was Warsaw completely razed to the ground by bombing raids?</h3><p>During the Second World War</p><p>Second World War</p><p>During the Second World War</p><h3>When did Warsaw start to rebuild?</h3><p>After liberation</p><p>After liberation</p><p>After liberation</p><h3>What building from the 19th century was destroyed between the 1950s and 1960s?</h3><p>Leopold Kronenberg Palace</p><p>Leopold Kronenberg Palace</p><p>Leopold Kronenberg Palace</p><h3>What style were the mass constructed residential blocks designed in?</h3><p>typical of Eastern bloc countries</p><p>basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries</p><p>design typical of Eastern bloc countries</p><h2>Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications.

The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of Baryczko merchant family (1562), building called &quot;The Negro&quot; (early 17th century) and Salwator tenement (1632). The most interesting examples of mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle (1596–1619) and the Jesuit Church (1609–1626) at Old Town.

The most impressive examples of rococo architecture are Czapski Palace (1712–1721), Palace of the Four Winds (1730s) and Visitationist Church (façade 1728–1761). The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period. Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the Palace on the Water (rebuilt 1775–1795), Królikarnia (1782–1786), Carmelite Church (façade 1761–1783) and Evangelical Holy Trinity Church (1777–1782). The economic growth during the first years of Congress Poland caused a rapid rise architecture.

During the first years after the war, the population growth was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses. The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital. Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore.</h2><h3>How many people lived in Warsaw in 1939?</h3><p>1,300,000</p><p>1,300,000</p><p>1,300,000</p><h3>What had the number of people living in Warsaw declined to by 1945?</h3><p>420,000</p><p>420,000</p><p>420,000</p><h3>When did the Warsaw area enlargement take place?</h3><p>1951</p><p>1951</p><p>1951</p><h3>What conviction did many Poles have regarding how the Varsovians thought of themselves?</h3><p>as better</p><p>thought of themselves as better</p><p>better</p><h3>What are there no longer limitations on since 1990?</h3><p>residency registration</p><p>residency registration</p><p>residency registration</p><h2>Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city.

Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.</h2><h3>What type of city has Warsaw been for as long as it's been a city?</h3><p>multi-cultural</p><p>multi-cultural city</p><p>multi-cultural</p><h3>What was Warsaw's population in 1901?</h3><p>711,988</p><p>711,988</p><p>711,988</p><h3>Of Warsaw's inhabitants in 1901, what percentage was Catholic?</h3><p>56.2%</p><p>35.7</p><p>56.2%</p><h3>What percentage of Warsaw's population was Protestant in 1901?</h3><p>2.8%</p><p>2.8</p><p>2.8%</p><h3>When were most of the places of religious worship destroyed in Warsaw?</h3><p>1944</p><p>1944</p><p>1944</p><h2>The basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (gmina). A city is also a commune – but with the city charter. Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt (wójt in Polish), however in the cities – burmistrz. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats. An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina). In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki. Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration. For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów). But for instance the districts in Kraków do not have entitlements of powiat, so the registration numbers in Kraków are of the same type for all districts.</h2><h3>What is the basic unit of territorial division in Poland?</h3><p>a commune</p><p>commune</p><p>commune</p><h3>What is the second level of territorial division in Poland?</h3><p>counties or powiats</p><p>counties or powiats</p><p>counties or powiats</p><h3>In what districts are the registration numbers for cars all of the same type?</h3><p>Kraków</p><p>Kraków</p><h2>Legislative power in Warsaw is vested in a unicameral Warsaw City Council (Rada Miasta), which comprises 60 members. Council members are elected directly every four years. Like most legislative bodies, the City Council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government. Bills passed by a simple majority are sent to the mayor (the President of Warsaw), who may sign them into law. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote.</h2><h3>Who in Warsaw has the power of legislative action?</h3><p>Warsaw City Council</p><p>Warsaw City Council</p><p>Warsaw City Council</p><h3>How many members are on the Warsaw City Counil?</h3><p>60</p><p>60</p><p>60</p><h3>How often are elections for the counsel held?</h3><p>every four years</p><p>four years</p><p>every four years.</p><h3>What does the City Council divide itself into?</h3><p>committees</p><p>committees</p><p>committees</p><h3>How many days does the Council have to override the mayor's veto?</h3><p>30 days</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><h2>The mayor of Warsaw is called President. Generally, in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called presidents – i.e. such cities, which have over 100,000 people or these, where already was president before 1990. The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695–1696). Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw Presidents was simultaneously the Warsaw Voivode. Since 1990 the President of Warsaw had been elected by the City council. In the years of 1994–1999 the mayor of the district Centrum automatically was designated as the President of Warsaw: the mayor of Centrum was elected by the district council of Centrum and the council was elected only by the Centrum residents. Since 2002 the President of Warsaw is elected by all of the citizens of Warsaw.</h2><h3>What is the mayor of Warsaw called?</h3><p>President</p><p>President</p><p>President</p><h3>Who was the first Warsaw President?</h3><p>Jan Andrzej Menich</p><p>Jan Andrzej Menich</p><p>Jan Andrzej Menich</p><h3>When did Menich serve as President?</h3><p>1695–1696</p><p>1695–1696</p><p>1695–1696</p><h3>Who has elected the President of Warsaw since 1990?</h3><p>the City council</p><p>City council</p><p>City council</p><h3>What district of Warsaw chose the President between 1994 and 1999?</h3><p>Centrum</p><p>Centrum</p><p>Centrum</p><h2>Warsaw, especially its city centre (Śródmieście), is home not only to many national institutions and government agencies, but also to many domestic and international companies.

The last two models listed were also sent abroad and assembled in a number of other countries, including Egypt and Colombia. In 1995 the factory was purchased by the South Korean car manufacturer Daewoo, which assembled the Tico, Espero, Nubia, Tacuma, Leganza, Lanos and Matiz there for the European market. In 2005 the factory was sold to AvtoZAZ, a Ukrainian car manufacturer which assembled there the Chevrolet Aveo.
