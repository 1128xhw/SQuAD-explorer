<html><body><div><h1>Prime_number</h1><h2>A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.</h2><h3>What is the only divisor besides 1 that a prime number can have?</h3><p>itself</p><p>itself</p><p>itself</p><p>itself</p><p>itself</p><h3>What are numbers greater than 1 that can be divided by 3 or more numbers called?</h3><p>composite number</p><p>composite number</p><p>composite number</p><p>primes</p><h3>What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?</h3><p>The fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><p>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><p>arithmetic</p><p>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><p>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><h3>Any number larger than 1 can be represented as a product of what?</h3><p>a product of primes</p><p>product of primes that is unique up to ordering</p><p>primes</p><p>primes</p><p>primes that is unique up to ordering</p><h3>Why must one be excluded in order to preserve the uniqueness of the fundamental theorem?</h3><p>because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization</p><p>one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization</p><p>can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization</p><p>one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization</p><p>because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization</p><h2>The property of being prime (or not) is called primality. A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and . Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. These include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. As of January 2016[update], the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits.</h2><h3>What is the name of the property that designates a number as being prime or not?</h3><p>primality</p><p>primality</p><p>primality</p><p>primality</p><p>primality</p><h3>What is the name of the process which confirms the primality of a number n?</h3><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><h3>What is the name of one algorithm useful for conveniently testing the primality of large numbers? </h3><p>the Miller–Rabin primality test</p><p>Miller–Rabin primality test</p><p>Miller–Rabin primality test</p><p>Miller–Rabin primality test</p><p>Miller–Rabin primality test</p><h3>What is the name of another algorithm useful for conveniently testing the primality of large numbers? </h3><p>the AKS primality test</p><p>AKS primality test</p><p>AKS primality test</p><p>AKS primality test</p><p>AKS primality test</p><h3>As of January 2016 how many digits does the largest known prime consist of?</h3><p>22,338,618 decimal digits</p><p>22,338,618</p><p>22,338,618</p><p>22,338,618</p><p>22,338,618</p><h2>There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.</h2><h3>How many prime numbers exist?</h3><p>infinitely many</p><p>infinitely</p><p>infinitely many</p><p>infinitely</p><p>infinitely many</p><h3>Who established the amount of prime numbers in existence?</h3><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><h3>What type of behavior in primes is it possible to determine?</h3><p>the statistical behaviour</p><p>distribution</p><p>statistical</p><p>statistical</p><p>statistical</p><h3>What theorem states that the probability that a number n is prime is inversely proportional to its logarithm?</h3><p>the prime number theorem</p><p>prime number theorem</p><p>prime number</p><p>prime number theorem</p><p>prime number theorem</p><h3>When was the prime number theorem proven?</h3><p>at the end of the 19th century</p><p>end of the 19th century</p><p>end of the 19th century</p><p>end of the 19th century</p><p>end of the 19th century</p><h2>Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open, such as Goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2). Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains, mainly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.</h2><h3>What is the name of the supposition that any number larger than 2 can be represented as the sum of two primes?</h3><p>Goldbach's conjecture</p><p>Goldbach's conjecture</p><p>Goldbach's conjecture</p><p>Goldbach's conjecture</p><p>Goldbach's conjecture</p><h3>What is the name of the supposition that there are infinite pairs of primes whose difference is 2?</h3><p>the twin prime conjecture</p><p>twin prime conjecture</p><p>twin prime conjecture</p><p>twin prime conjecture</p><p>twin prime conjecture</p><h3>Besides the analytic property of numbers, what other property of numbers does number theory focus on?</h3><p>algebraic aspects</p><p>algebraic</p><p>algebraic</p><p>algebraic</p><p>algebraic aspects</p><h3>What is the application of prime numbers used in information technology which utilizes the fact that factoring very large prime numbers is very challenging?</h3><p>public-key cryptography</p><p>public-key cryptography</p><p>public-key cryptography</p><p>cryptography</p><p>public-key cryptography</p><h3>What is the name of one algebraic generalization prime numbers have inspired?</h3><p>prime ideals</p><p>prime elements</p><p>prime elements</p><p>prime elements</p><h2>Hence, 6 is not prime. The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime: 12 = 3 · 4. No even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number n has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and n. This implies that n is not prime. Accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2. Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.</h2><h3> Any even number larger than what cannot be considered prime?</h3><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><h3>What are the specific divisors of all even numbers larger than 2?</h3><p>1, 2, and n</p><p>1, 2, and n</p><p>1, 2, and n</p><p>1, 2, and n</p><p>1, 2, and n</p><h3>What name is given to any prime number larger than 2?</h3><p>odd prime</p><p>odd prime</p><p>odd prime</p><p>odd prime</p><p>odd prime</p><h3>Besides 1,3 and 7, what other number must all primes greater than 5 end with?</h3><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><h3>What type of numbers are always multiples of 2?</h3><p>even numbers</p><p>even</p><p>even numbers</p><p>even</p><p>even</p><h2>Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime. Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime. By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a &quot;unit&quot;.</h2><h3>What number did early Greeks not regard as a true number?</h3><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><h3>Who included 1 as the first prime number in the mid 18th century?</h3><p>Christian Goldbach</p><p>Christian Goldbach</p><p>Christian Goldbach</p><p>mathematicians</p><p>mathematicians</p><h3>In the mid 18th century, who did not concur that 1 should be the first prime number?</h3><p>Leonhard Euler</p><p>Leonhard Euler</p><p>Leonhard Euler</p><p>Leonhard Euler</p><p>Leonhard Euler</p><h3>How many primes were included in Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of prime numbers?</h3><p>10,006,721</p><p>primes up to 10,006,721</p><p>10,006,721</p><p>10,006,721</p><p>10,006,721</p><h3>What type of number do modern mathematicians consider 1 to be?</h3><p>its own special category as a &quot;unit&quot;</p><p>unit</p><p>a &quot;unit&quot;</p><p>unit</p><p>a &quot;unit</p><h2>A large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic (mentioned above) would not hold as stated. For example, the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5; if 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified. Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.</h2><h3>Which theorem would be invalid if the number 1 were considered prime?</h3><p>Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><p>Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><p>arithmetic</p><p>Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><p>Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p><h3>The sieve of Eratosthenes would not be valid if what were true?</h3><p>if 1 were considered a prime</p><p>1 were considered a prime</p><p>1 were considered a prime</p><p>if 1 were considered a prime</p><p>if 1 were considered a prime</p><h3>What is another function that primes have that the number 1 does not?</h3><p>Euler's totient function</p><p>sum of divisors function</p><p>sum of divisors function</p><p>the sum of divisors function</p><p>sum of divisors</p><h3>What is one function that prime numbers have that 1 does not?</h3><p>the sum of divisors function</p><p>relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function</p><p>relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function</p><p>relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function</p><p>the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function</p><h3>If 1 were to be considered as prime what would the sieve of Eratosthenes yield for all other numbers?</h3><p>only the single number 1</p><p>1</p><p>only the single number 1</p><p>eliminate all multiples of 1</p><p>eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1.</p><h2>There are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks. Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.</h2><h3>What is the name of the Egyptian papyrus that suggests that they may have had knowledge of prime numbers?</h3><p>the Rhind papyrus</p><p>Rhind</p><p>Rhind</p><p>Egyptian fraction</p><p>Rhind papyrus</p><h3>What civilization was the first known to clearly study prime numbers?</h3><p>the Ancient Greeks</p><p>Ancient Greeks</p><p>Greeks</p><p>Ancient Greeks</p><p>Ancient Greeks</p><h3>What work from around 300 BC has significant theorems about prime numbers?</h3><p>Euclid's Elements</p><p>Euclid's Elements</p><p>Euclid's Elements</p><p>Euclid's Elements</p><p>Euclid's Elements</p><h3>Who demonstrated how to create a perfect number from a Mersenne prime?</h3><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><p>Euclid</p><h3>What does the Sieve of Eratosthenes do?</h3><p>compute primes</p><p>compute primes</p><p>compute primes</p><p>compute primes</p><p>compute primes</p><h2>After the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century. In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler). Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime (they are called Fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1). However, the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime. The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1, with p a prime. They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.</h2><h3>In what year did Pierre de Fermat declare Fermat's little theorem?</h3><p>In 1640</p><p>1640</p><p>1640</p><p>1640</p><p>1640</p><h3>Besides Leibniz, what other mathematician proved the validity of Fermat's little theorem?</h3><p>Euler</p><p>Euler</p><p>Euler</p><p>Euler</p><p>Euler</p><h3>Of what form do Fermat numbers take?</h3><p>22n + 1</p><p>22n + 1</p><p>22n + 1</p><p>22n + 1</p><p>22n + 1</p><h3>Of what form do Mersenne primes take?</h3><p>2p − 1</p><p>2p − 1, with p a prime</p><p>2p − 1</p><p>2p − 1</p><p>2p − 1</p><h3>To what extent did Fermat confirm the validity of Fermat numbers?</h3><p>up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1)</p><p>up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1)</p><p>216 + 1</p><p>n = 4</p><p>n = 4</p><h2>The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division. This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if  is composite (with a and b ≠ 1) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most . For example, for , the trial divisions are by m = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to  is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.</h2><h3>What is the most elemental way to test the primality of any integer n?</h3><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><p>trial division</p><h3>What makes the method of trial division more efficient?</h3><p>if a complete list of primes up to  is known</p><p>a complete list of primes up to  is known</p><p>complete list of primes up to  is known</p><p>if a complete list of primes up to  is known</p><p>if a complete list of primes up to  is known</p><h3>Trial division involves dividing n by every integer m greater than what?</h3><p>greater than 1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n</p><p>1</p><h3>How many divisions are required to verify the primality of the number 37?</h3><p>only three divisions</p><p>only for those m that are prime</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><p>three</p><h3>What must the integer m be less than or equal to when performing trial division?</h3><p>less than or equal to the square root of n</p><p>the square root of n</p><p>square root of n</p><p>the square root of n.</p><p>the square root of n.</p><h2>Modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;) and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.</h2><h3>How many modern types of primality tests for general numbers n are there? </h3><p>two main classes</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><p>two</p><h3>What is the name of one type of modern primality test?</h3><p>probabilistic (or &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;)</p><p>probabilistic (or &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;)</p><p>probabilistic</p><p>probabilistic</p><p>probabilistic</p><h3>What is the name of another type of modern primality test?</h3><p>deterministic</p><p>deterministic algorithms</p><p>deterministic</p><p>deterministic algorithms</p><p>deterministic algorithms</p><h3>What type of algorithm is trial division?</h3><p>deterministic</p><p>deterministic algorithm</p><p>deterministic</p><p>deterministic</p><p>deterministic</p><h3>When using a probabilistic algorithm, how is the probability that the number is composite expressed mathematically?</h3><p>1/(1-p)n</p><p>1/(1-p)n</p><p>1/(1-p)n</p><p>1/(1-p)n</p><p>1/(1-p)n</p><h2>A particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number.

A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers. Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers, though, so this test can be useful for practical purposes. More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.</h2><h3>What is one straightforward case of a probabilistic test?</h3><p>the Fermat primality test,</p><p>Fermat primality test</p><p>Fermat primality test</p><p>Fermat primality test</p><p>the Fermat primality test</p><h3>What does the Fermat primality test depend upon?</h3><p>np≡n (mod p)</p><p>np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number</p><p>np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number</p><p>np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number</p><p>the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number</p><h3>What type of numbers demonstrate a flaw with the Fermat primality test?</h3><p>composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers)</p><p>Carmichael</p><p>Carmichael</p><p>Carmichael numbers</p><p>Carmichael numbers</p><h3>What is the name of one impressive continuation of the Fermat primality test?</h3><p>Baillie-PSW</p><p>Baillie-PSW</p><p>Baillie-PSW</p><p>Baillie-PSW</p><p>Baillie-PSW,</p><h3>What is the name of another compelling continuation of the Fermat primality test?</h3><p>Solovay-Strassen tests</p><p>Miller-Rabin</p><p>Miller-Rabin</p><p>Miller-Rabin</p><p>Miller-Rabin</p><h2>are prime.

What is more, the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run—the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6.</h2><h3>What is another way to state the condition that infinitely many primes can exist only if a and q are coprime?</h3><p>their greatest common divisor is one</p><p>greatest common divisor is one</p><p>their greatest common divisor is one</p><p>their greatest common divisor is one</p><h3>If a and q are coprime, which theorem holds that an arithmetic progression has an infinite number of primes?</h3><p>Dirichlet's theorem</p><p>Dirichlet's</p><p>Dirichlet's theorem</p><p>Dirichlet's theorem</p><h3>What is the density of all primes compatible with a modulo 9?</h3><p>1/6</p><p>1/6</p><p>1/6</p><p>1/6</p><h3>If q=9 and a=3,6 or 9, how many primes would be in the progression?</h3><p>at most one prime number</p><p>one</p><p>one</p><p>at most one</p><h3>If q=9 and a=1,2,4,5,7, or 8, how many primes would be in a progression?</h3><p>infinitely many prime numbers</p><p>infinitely many</p><p>infinite</p><p>infinitely many</p><h2>The zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then ζ(1) would have a finite value. However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes. Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (Basel problem), due to Euler,</h2><h3>What function is related to prime numbers?</h3><p>The zeta function</p><p>zeta</p><p>zeta function</p><p>zeta function</p><h3>What type of value would the zeta function have if there were finite primes?</h3><p>a finite value</p><p>finite</p><p>finite</p><p>finite</p><h3>What property of the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... shows that there is an infinite number of primes?</h3><p>diverges</p><p>diverges</p><p>exceeds any given number</p><h3>What does it mean when a harmonic series diverges?</h3><p>exceeds any given number</p><p>exceeds any given number</p><p>exceeds any given number</p><p>exceeds any given number</p><h3>Of what mathematical nature is the Basel problem?</h3><p>identity</p><p>algebraic</p><p>modern algebraic number theory</p><p>modern algebraic number theory</p><h2>The unproven Riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for s = −2, −4, ..., all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2. The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct. In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason.</h2><h3>When was the Riemann hypothesis proposed?</h3><p>1859</p><p>1859</p><p>1859</p><p>1859</p><h3>According to the Riemann hypothesis, all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2 except for what values of s?</h3><p>s = −2, −4, ...,</p><p>−2, −4, ...,</p><p>−2, −4</p><p>s = −2, −4</p><h3>What does the Riemann hypothesis state the source of irregularity in the distribution of points comes from?</h3><p>random noise</p><p>random noise</p><p>random noise</p><p>random noise</p><h3>What type of prime distribution does the Riemann hypothesis propose is also true for short intervals near X?</h3><p>asymptotic distribution</p><p>asymptotic</p><p>asymptotic distribution</p><p>asymptotic distribution</p><h3>What type of prime distribution is characterized about x/log x of numbers less than x?</h3><p>asymptotic distribution</p><p>asymptotic</p><p>asymptotic distribution</p><p>asymptotic distribution</p><h2>In addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017. Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes. The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.</h2><h3>Which conjecture holds that every even integer n greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of two primes?</h3><p>Goldbach's conjecture</p><p>Goldbach's</p><p>Goldbach's</p><p>Goldbach's</p><h3>When did Landau propose his four conjectural problems?</h3><p>1912</p><p>1912</p><p>1912</p><p>1912</p><h3>As of February 2011, how many numbers has Goldbach's conjecture been proven to?</h3><p>all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017</p><p>n = 2 · 1017</p><p>n = 2</p><p>n = 2</p><h3>Which theorem states that all large odd integers can be expressed as a sum of three primes?</h3><p>Vinogradov's theorem</p><p>Vinogradov's</p><p>Vinogradov's theorem</p><p>Vinogradov's theorem</p><h3>Which theorem states that every large even integer can be written as a prime summed with a semiprime?</h3><p>Chen's theorem</p><p>Chen's</p><p>Chen's theorem</p><p>Chen's theorem</p><h2>A third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture.</h2><h3>What conjecture holds that there is an infinite amount of twin primes?</h3><p>twin prime conjecture</p><p>twin prime conjecture</p><p>twin prime conjecture</p><p>Polignac's</p><h3>What is a twin prime?</h3><p>pairs of primes with difference 2</p><p>pairs of primes with difference 2</p><p>pairs of primes with difference 2</p><p>pairs of primes with difference 2</p><h3>Which conjecture holds that for any positive integer n, there is an infinite amount of pairs of consecutive primes differing by 2n?</h3><p>Polignac's conjecture</p><p>Polignac's</p><p>Polignac's conjecture</p><p>Polignac's</p><h3>Of what form is the infinite amount of primes that comprise the special cases of Schinzel's hypothesis?</h3><p>n2 + 1</p><p>n2 + 1</p><p>n2 + 1.</p><p>n2 + 1</p><h3>What conjecture holds that there are always a minimum of 4 primes  between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2?</h3><p>Brocard's conjecture</p><p>Brocard's</p><p>Brocard's conjecture</p><p>Brocard's</p><h2>For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance. However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.</h2><h3>Besides the study of prime numbers, what general theory was considered the official example of pure mathematics?</h3><p>number theory</p><p>number theory</p><p>number theory</p><p>number theory</p><h3>What British mathematician took pride in doing work that he felt had no military benefit?</h3><p>G.

Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1. The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p &gt; 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p − 1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n &gt; 4 is composite if and only if (n − 1)! is divisible by n.</h2><h3>Assuming p is a prime other than 2 or 5, then, according to Fermat's theorem, what type of decimal will 1/p always be?</h3><p>a recurring decimal</p><p>recurring</p><p>recurring</p><p>recurring</p><p>recurring</p><h3>According to Fermat's theorem, what period does 1/p always have assuming p is prime that is not 2 or 5?</h3><p>p − 1</p><p>p − 1</p><p>p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1</p><p>p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1</p><p>p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1</p><h3>According to Wilson's theorem, what factorial must be divisible by p if some integer p &gt; 1 is to be considered prime?</h3><p>(p − 1)! + 1</p><p>(p − 1)! + 1</p><p>(p − 1)! + 1</p><p>(p − 1)! + 1</p><p>(p − 1)! + 1</p><h3>According to Wilson's theorem, what factorial must be divisible by n if some integer n &gt; 4 is to be considered composite?</h3><p>(n − 1)!</p><p>(n − 1)!</p><p>(n − 1)!</p><p>(n − 1)!</p><p>(n − 1)!</p><h3>What condition what must be satisfied in order for 1/p to be expressed in base q instead of base 10 and still have a period of p - 1?</h3><p>p is not a prime factor of q</p><p>p is not a prime factor of q</p><p>p is not a prime factor of q</p><p>p is not a prime factor of q.</p><p>p is not a prime factor of q.</p><h2>Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (for example, 512-bit primes are frequently used for RSA and 1024-bit primes are typical for Diffie–Hellman.).

These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.

Generally, &quot;prime&quot; indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.</h2><h3>What does the word prime generally suggest?</h3><p>indecomposability</p><p>minimality</p><p>minimality or indecomposability</p><p>minimality or indecomposability</p><h3>For a field F containing 0 and 1, what would be the prime field?</h3><p>the smallest subfield</p><p>the smallest subfield</p><p>Q or the finite field with p elements</p><p>the smallest subfield</p><h3>How can any knot be distinctively indicated?</h3><p>as a connected sum of prime knots</p><p>as a connected sum of prime knots</p><p>as a connected sum of prime knots</p><p>as a connected sum of prime knots</p><h3>What is an additional meaning intended when the word prime is used?</h3><p>any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components</p><p>any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components</p><p>any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components</p><p>any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components</p><h3>What does it mean for a knot to be considered indecomposable?</h3><p>it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots</p><p>cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots</p><p>cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots</p><p>it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots</p><h2>Prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R, an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined: prime elements and irreducible elements. An element p of R is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit (i.e., does not have a multiplicative inverse) and satisfies the following requirement: given x and y in R such that p divides the product xy, then p divides x or y. An element is irreducible if it is not a unit and cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units.
